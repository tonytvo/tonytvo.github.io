# Ellerslie 

Here’s a comprehensive investor‑style neighborhood outline for Ellerslie in southeast Edmonton, based on the latest publicly available data (\~2019–2025):

---

## ✅ 1. Nearby amenities & attractions

* Several small parks and pathway networks throughout the community ([City of Edmonton][1])
* Nearby Summerside and Walker Park, local playgrounds, and the former Ellerslie Rugby Park (closed 2022) ([Wikipedia][2])
* Commercial nodes along Ellerslie Road and 91 Street provide grocery stores, banks, fast food, small restaurants, and proximity to South Edmonton and Windermere shopping areas ([AreaVibes][3])

---

## 🏗️ 2. When houses were built & common building types

* Community planned in early‑2000s; rapid residential development followed, mostly completed by mid‑2010s ([City of Edmonton][1])
* Building types: \~60–66% single‑family detached; \~20% row/semi‑detached/duplex; \~12–15% townhouses; low‑rise apartments \~5–12% ([Gimme-Shelter][4])

---

## 📐 3. Zoning and density (units per lot)

* Based on Edmonton’s Area Structure Plan and Neighbourhood Structure Plan, zoning supports low to medium density: R‑1 (single detached), R‑2/R‑3 (semi, duplex) and R TH / R AD for townhouses/apartments in specific nodes.
* Most lots are single‑detached; townhome/duplex zones allow multiple units per lot in designated blocks. Opportunities exist in re‑zoning older lots for infill, but majority built-out under original zoning plan ([City of Edmonton][1], [Wikipedia][5])

---

## 🧍 4. Population & growth

* 2012 municipal census: 5,566 residents, 5.7 % growth since 2009 ([Wikipedia][6])
* Broader Ellerslie area (including Orchards, Summerside) had \~8,400 residents by 2019 across \~3,000 dwellings (\~2.49 km²) ([Gimme-Shelter][4])

---

## 💰 5. Average income

* Median household income \~C\$106,400—\~12% above Alberta average, and \~29% above national average ([AreaVibes][3])

---

## 🚨 6. Crime rate

* Overall crime \~11% lower than Edmonton average; raw rate \~5,695 per 100,000 people—though Edmonton averages are high in national terms ([AreaVibes][3])

---

## 🏘️ 7. Rental supply & demand

* Current rental listings in Ellerslie (\~19–25 active units across types); mix of duplexes, townhouses, condos, basement suites, some single‑family rental houses ([RentFaster.ca][7])
* Demand seems modest but steady; many homeowners, but also families and professional renters nearby. Limited supply but data is partial.

---

## 💵 8. Average rents

According to RentFaster and Zumper:

* Duplexes: avg \~\$2,216 /mo (ranges \~\$2,100–2,300)
* Townhouses: avg \~\$1,746 /mo (\~1,525–1,850)
* Condos/apartments: \~\$1,573 /mo
* Basements: \~\$1,095–1,350 (\~avg \$1,222)
* Houses: \~\$2,275 for full single‑family rental ([RentFaster.ca][7])

---

## 🏙️ 9. A/B/C/D Neighborhood Grade

* Livability score \~66/100 (“Good”)
* Amenities score D (few local amenities), crime grade D, cost of living A, employment A+, housing A, but schools D+ ([AreaVibes][3])
* Overall this suggests a **B‑range** neighborhood: strong housing, income, safety; limited walkable retail/schools.

---

## 📊 10. House prices & appreciation potential

* Specific median sale price data not in public summary; market listed by some sources as “n/a” ([AreaVibes][3])
* Comparatively newer suburban southeast area, moderate‑to‑strong long‑term appeal tied to Windermere expansion, proximity to Anthony Henday, growing population.
* Likely price growth in line with Edmonton suburban avg (\~3–5% annually), with upside via infill or densification.

---

## 💡 11. Investment strategies

### ✅ A. Value-add / infill

* Acquire older single‑family on standard lots and apply for rezoning/infill (duplex, townhome) to increase density and cashflow.

### ✅ B. New-build rental or townhomes

* Develop small multi‑unit infill. New units in townhome form can command \$1,700–2,200+/mo.

### ✅ C. Long‑term hold (buy & hold single family)

* With median income and low vacancy rates, rent well. Stable moderate cashflow if leveraged.

### ✅ D. BRRRR strategy on basement suites

* Purchase single-family, add legal basement rental suite; collect basement rent (\~\$1,200) while long-term tenants upstairs.

### ✅ E. Multi-family rental block

* Invest in or develop low-rise apartment units in designated zones near transit corridors or commercial nodes.

---

## 🏘️ 8. Rental supply & demand

* Appreciation: Properties in Grovenor typically steady long‑term growth, buoyed by mature location, infill potential, and core‑area attraction; modest rental yields vs appreciation from price growth.

---

## 🧰 12. Investment strategies that fit Grovenor

### ✅ A. Infill / Build-Down

* Convert older single‑family homes by adding **legal basement suites** or secondary units for rental income.

### B. BRRRR or Legal Basement Suites

* Buying a detached or row‐home, renovating and adding a legal basement suite can boost rental income and value.

### C. Small Multi‑unit or Townhouse Redevelopment

* Under NSP and zoning, possible to acquire older units and redevelop into row housing or low-rise townhouses to increase density and yield.

### D. Entry-level Rentals Targeting Young Families/Professionals

* With average income below city average, lower‑cost 2‑3 bedroom rentals appeal to middle-income households, students, and entry workers.

Belmead is a **value-oriented, family-friendly neighbourhood** with strong occupancy, affordable housing, and solid rental demand. While crime is elevated relative to city norms, residents benefit from close proximity to West Edmonton Mall, convenient transit routes, and a built environment supportive of **infill redevelopment and density upgrades**. For investors: good opportunity for **cash flow entry**, value‑add via **suite conversions or row-house infill**, and potential for moderate appreciation tied to mature west‑Edmonton growth dynamics.

---

## 🏡 3. Common Building Types

---

## 📐 4. Zoning & Density Potential

* Zoned for **low to medium density** residential. Dominated by single-family zoning, with pockets of row‑housing and low‑rise apartments.
* Some potential exists for infill or small multi-unit redevelopments within the mature Londonderry overlay—but mass densification is limited without rezoning ([Wikipedia][4]).

---

## 👥 5. Population & Growth

* Little data on row houses, but they are likely similar or slightly more.

---

## 🏅 10. Neighborhood Grade

* **Livability 67/100**; amenities C, employment C+, cost of living A+, housing B+; crime rated F in Areavibes grading ([AreaVibes][2]).
* Overall, Kilkenny is a **C‑ or lower B‑grade area**: affordable housing but higher crime and average incomes.

---

## 📈 11. Average House Prices & Appreciation Potential

* MLS listings mid‑2025 show **townhomes \~C\$220k**, single‑family homes **C\$399–435k**; apartments as low as **C\$78–81k** ([Zillow][9], [edmontonrealestate.pro][10]).

### ✅ A. Buy‑and‑Hold Entry-Level Rentals

* Low acquisition costs (\~C\$400k) and rents \~C\$1,300–1,780/mo offer moderate positive cash flow even with elevated risk from crime; good for affordable market tenants.

### ✅ B. BRRRR with Basement Suites

* Legal suites in bungalows can raise total rent income, improving return in lower-priced homes.

### ✅ C. Small Infill or Row-House Redevelopment

* Opportunities where row housing allowed; limited scale but could densify pockets within zoning provisions.

### ✅ D. Acquire & Renovate Value Properties

* Cosmetic upgrades or modest renovation of aging apartments or townhomes could extract value for resale or rent bump.

2. Examine **City of Edmonton zoning maps and the Northmount/Londonderry plans** to discover infill viability.
3. Review **EPS crime mapping portal** for block-by-block trends and hotspots ([Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][8], [Wikipedia][11], [Wikipedia][1], [AreaVibes][2], [AreaVibes][6]).
4. Analyze vacancy & rent trends through **CMHC or platform data** for rental demand clarity.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

Kilkenny presents a **budget-friendly entry point** for investors targeting stable rents and modest returns. While crime rates and below-average income dampen appeal, the low property prices combined with demand for affordable family housing create **cash-flow opportunities**. Best suited for investors interested in **value-add via suites or renovations**, or **long-term hold** in an affordable mature area with limited appreciation potential.

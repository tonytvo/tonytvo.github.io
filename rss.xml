&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what’s the right input?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how can we write tests wihtout writing the parser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which one is correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seems like we lean toward T:0:1 on the input intent?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have you learned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this kata is very rich in term of domain/functional tibbits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;once I finish encapsulating drinks and ingredients, I started to realize couple other domain concepts like inventory, recipes, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seems like introduce parameter is very helpful, keep surface to the top as much as possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the better we are as introduce parameter, dependency, the more we can clear recognize the boundaries between different parts, like model, view controller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;focus more on reading so we can understand more on what’s needed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have disagree on what th requiremnts looks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we don’t have to understand test fraework, we spend itme in the wrong direction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before we spend time on the task, we need to spened time on understanding the r3quiremnt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we expect the string and then use some regex .. kind of like cucumber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we all made good points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;communicate with kindness, intention, respect, and considerate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we’re confusing on the sstring format&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we all have our interpretation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a strategy I followed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functional calisthenics and object calisthenics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the steps I followed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what are emotions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotions are action-requiring neurological programs that bring you specific gifts and skills to help you understand your world. Each of your emotions requires its own action, and each action helps you learn more about yourself and your environment. When you know what emotions are for, you can respond to them in new ways and discover your inborn emotional genius!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking Stress &amp;#x26; Resistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stress and resistance are masking words for emotional responses to difficult situations. The key to unmasking your emotions is to catch yourself when you describe yourself as “stressed out.” What do you mean by that? What do you feel? What are your emotions trying to tell you, and why are those emotions arising? What actions should you take? Are changes coming too quickly (see Fear)? Are your boundaries being threatened (see Anger)? Are you losing access to important resources (see Envy)? Are you holding on to something that really doesn’t work (see Sadness)? Have you suffered a loss (see Grief)? And so on. Stress is always an emotional reaction to whatever is occurring around you – and you know how to work with emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resistance can look like an unwillingness to engage with what is occurring, but the truth is deeper than that. Resisting something is also a way to stop everything and underscore and highlight the situation; if you can turn toward your resistance and its emotional content, you will often discover absolute genius inside it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotions and feelings – what’s the difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotions are reliable neurological programs that arise in response to specific stimuli. Your ability to feel and properly identify your emotions determines your level of emotional awareness. As a reminder, this is the complete flowchart – from stimulus to action – that we explored in our presentation today:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotionally evocative stimulus → Emotion arises → You feel it → You identify it → You question the emotion → You act on the information the emotion provides OR you decide not to act because the stimulus is invalid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know this seems like a long pathway, but you can actually do it in a split second once you get your emotional skills under you. It’s not hard. It’s actually much harder in the long run to sleepwalk through your life, being pushed around by emotions you can’t identify or understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an emotion is evoked, it gives you information about an emotionally relevant stimulus, and it tells you what you’ve perceived and what you’re experiencing. Your job as the partner of your emotions is to feel and identify the emotion, ask the correct questions, and act in a way that is both emotional and rational. This is not only possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s doable, and this process becomes very easy (and fun, and enlightening) once you get the hang of it. Thank you for bringing your emotional awareness to a waiting world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expression, Repression, and the Middle Ground&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of us have been taught to express or repress our emotions; and we weren’t taught about any other options. Although expression and repression can be helpful at times, “neither approach works because neither one accepts emotions as important messengers that help us learn and evolve” (pg. 33).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can learn to work with your emotions and discover the messages they contain, you can access the skills and abilities inside each of them – and develop a more wholesome and conscious understanding of yourself and others. This process of listening to your emotions, supporting them, and identifying their purpose is called channeling:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quarternity model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this model, your &lt;strong&gt;earth element&lt;/strong&gt; symbolizes your physical and bodily experiences; your &lt;strong&gt;air element&lt;/strong&gt; characterizes your intellect and your cognitive abilities; your &lt;strong&gt;water element&lt;/strong&gt; embodies the flow and depth of your emotions; and your &lt;strong&gt;fire element&lt;/strong&gt; represents your spiritual, visionary, and contemplative realms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that judgment stops you from experiencing life fully is false. Judgment is the ability to react as an individual and use your discerning intelligence freely. We need to rescue our much-wronged ability to judge and bring it back to a place of honor at the center of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy judgment is a combination of your airy intellect and your watery emotions coming together to form a considered opinion. It helps you define yourself in the world and separate the wheat from the chaff. This process of definition keeps you focused and centered. It’s an internal decision-making process about what a thing is and whether it suits you or not…. Thoughts and emotions are partners. They’re not enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been trained to overemphasize our intellects and undervalue our emotions. We don’t know how to feel deeply and think brilliantly at the same time, and we’re incapable of connecting our emotional flow to our intellectual processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New vision of self&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: When all of your elements are flowing and balanced, you develop a meta-intelligent, fifthelement personality and a fuller experience of what it is to be a whole and integrated person. A wonderful aspect of balancing your elements is that it is a fairly simple task once you realize that balance is a possibility. However, it can be challenging at first to reach this level of wholeness and integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us use addictions and distractions to get through our days and deal with challenging aspects of our lives. Although these practices can help us take our minds off of things, they are not generally forthright ways to deal with troubling situations. As you gently observe your own addictive and avoidant tendencies, it can help to understand why you’re distracting yourself and what you’re avoiding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key to ending suffering is to fully understand the causes and dimensions of our suffering. When we regularly rely on addictions and distractions to deal with pain and suffering, we are actually stopping ourselves from forming a clear and precise picture of what our suffering is about. When we can instead feel our emotions and balance our internal elements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathically speaking, traumatic and dissociative behaviors are almost always contagious. Our disavowed (though never absent) empathic skills always alert us to traumatic behaviors and dissociation in other people…. As a species, we have been socialized to dissociate and distract ourselves from life as a matter of course, and as a result, most of us aren’t fully aware of how or why we dissociate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;trauma responses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repression, learn to traumatize themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expression, traumatize others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;channel it from within an awakened psyche, to enter consciously, to dive into the emotions, the thoughts, the visions, and the sensations - and to turn the trauma on its ear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stages of initiation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stage one: separation from the known world. Disorganized removal from the known world - a sudden, shocking, and wholly unexpected end to normalcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stage two: a brush with death.  It is the out of control moment of the assault - the beating, the yelling, the unwelcome touch that separates spirit from body, or the beginning of the operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stage three: being welcomed as an initiated person. Sadly, in trauma, there is no welcoming back for trauma survivors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we can understand and work with our emotions in empathic and respectful ways, they can help us work through pain and trauma. Emotions are messages from deep within ourselves; they tell us what’s going on – and what we need to do – in any situation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us have been taught that forgiveness is necessary before we can move on from painful or traumatic situations. We’ve also been taught that anger is toxic. Sadly, these ideas are only partially true, and they can actually slow down our healing. Anger and forgiveness can work beautifully together if we know how to honor them appropriately&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;getting grounded&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centering our attention in our bodies in the present moment is uncommon in our culture because so many modern people make distinct separations between the physical (or profane) world and the spiritual (or divine) realm… When you have proper grounded focus, you can direct flows in each of your elements, and you can learn to navigate those flows rather than being pushed around. When you can navigate, you won’t need to distract yourself or avoid your emotions, because you’ll be able to focus your attention properly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grounding is a form of running your life energy downward. It helps you connect to your qi source, which is located in your lower belly beneath your navel or in your solar plexus, and connects you to the earth. From there, your movement into deeper practice and strength flows naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ground yourself, breathe into your belly and imagine that you’re gathering warmth and light in your belly, and as you breathe out, imagine that your breath and light are moving down through your body and into your chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grounding is the master skill in this process because it helps you focus yourself inside your body while you connect yourself to the earth. It helps you remain centered in the outer world by giving you a way to cleanse and stabilize yourself in the inner world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grounding is the opposite of dissociation. When you can ground your tension and any intense emotions, you won’t need to blast other people or repress everything. You’ll be able to figure out why you’re ungrounded and address it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our culture supports distraction and dissociation at every possible turn; therefore, remaining centered and integrated can be rather difficult. In order to stay focused and grounded, you’ll need protection and definition; you’ll need a sacred place where you can work without interference, and you’ll need a strong and flexible boundary around yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complaining consciously is a healthy way to become aware of, express, and release what’s going on inside of you – in safety and privacy. Conscious complaining is especially helpful in a life of striving, good works, and personal growth, where complaining is often considered less than saintly (this is a shame, because all by itself, a lack of permission to complain can cause unresolving repetitive mood states like worry, depression, and apathy)…. Conscious complaining gives a voice to your struggles, and in so doing, it restores your flow, your energy, your sense of humor, and your hope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you work to balance your elements and engage with your emotions empathically, it’s important to have a practice for rejuvenating yourself. This practice helps you soothe yourself, take some quiet time to integrate the changes you’re making, and move forward refreshed. It’s important to rejuvenate yourself so that old behaviors won’t be able to reanimate themselves. When you clear a space in your psyche with contract burning, it’s important to refill yourself consciously. If you don’t consciously refill that empty space, it will be filled unconsciously, and you don’t want that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANGER: The Honorable Sentry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Anger arises to address threats to your voice, standpoint position, interpersonal boundaries, or self image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Honor ~ Conviction ~ Healthy self esteem ~ Proper boundaries ~ Healthy detachment ~ Protection of yourself and others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: What must be protected? What must be restored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Think about your relationship with your own anger. Is it healthy? Do you regularly express your anger, or do you more often repress it? Have you ever channeled your anger in a way that works for everyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you personify anger, you’ll find that it is a mix between a stalwart castle guard and an ancient sage. Anger sets your boundaries by walking the perimeter of your soul and keeping an eye on you, the people around you, and your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger is a vital and boundary-defining emotion. When you can instead channel this noble emotion properly, you’ll be able to maintain your boundary and protect the boundaries of others with honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we drop our vital, anger-supported boundaries and ignore our individual needs and wishes, we become extremely vulnerable. When the psyche is unprotected, anger becomes necessary, and if anger is constantly pushed into the shadows, it can only erupt in shadowy ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you channel your anger properly, it will help you maintain your sense of self while protecting you and the people around you. When you go on a rampage, you dishonor everyone you encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take hold of your anger and channel it properly, you allow your anger to arise when you’re attacked. You welcome the potent surge of indignation and honor the fact of the attack, instead of brushing it away with pseudospiritual gentility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Taoist saying The glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time you fall is especially valuable in understanding the honorable use of anger. When you can channel your angers, you won’t be invincible, but you’ll be able to see your fall clearly and rise again with honor and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are angry, you are honouring the person or situation that angers you. It’s difficult to honor something or someone that is unimportant to you. If you can use your anger to reset your boundary and burn your contracts with whatever has angered you, you’ll learn vital truths about the issues you need to face and the relationships you need to mend or honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re done with the conflict, take some time to reground and refocus yourself. Anger releases a great deal of energy into your system, so it’s a good idea to refresh yourself and bring every part of you into the present moment, where you’re a different person than you were when the conflict began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem contradictory, but habitually angry people are also deeply caring people because anger always stems from concern. When people in your life are habitually angry, bless them; they are feeling too much of the world for their comfort, and their boundaries are in tatters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel unpleasant aftereffects from your anger, just empathize with them. If your anger causes any unpleasant aftereffects, know that you may have a punishing connection with it. Burn these contracts with your anger, and your anger will be able to flow properly and become the healing force it was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APATHY &amp;#x26; BOREDOM: The Mask for Anger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Apathy is a protective mask for anger, and it arises in situations where you cannot or should not (probably) express your anger openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Detachment ~ Boundary-setting ~ Separation ~ Taking a time-out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: What is being avoided? What must be made conscious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Do you feel apathetic or bored in any areas of your life? If so, think about how your apathy and boredom might be providing a protective mask for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re unable or unwilling to deal with your anger, you’ll fall into the masking state of apathy. Apathy is a state of dissociation, usually caused by being stuck in the wrong environment for your needs. It seeks distractions such as TV, fun food, new loves, travel, money, and shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apathy and boredom are two of the most common symptoms of the environment being too small for your soul. They are signs of a lack of boundaries and a need for change, but they are done in an ineffectual and distractible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We struggle against our natural depressions and anxieties with incredible amounts of boredom-relieving stimuli. We can’t stop to feel or dream because we have to keep moving. In response, we become highly distractible automatons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to distinguish between apathy that arises from your unwillingness to rest and apathy that arises from your inability to set boundaries and channel your anger appropriately. If you are filled with apathy right now, honor it, but feed it with a deeper version of what it wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apathy is a difficult condition to deal with because it is often caused by people isolating themselves or throwing their energy away rather than setting boundaries properly. You can help honor apathy in others by modeling honorable engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GUILT &amp;#x26; SHAME: Restoring Integrity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Shame arises to moderate your behavior and make sure that you don’t hurt, embarrass, destabilize, or dehumanize yourself or others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Atonement ~ Integrity ~ Self-respect ~ Behavioral change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: Who has been hurt? What must be made right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Are there times when your shame feels repetitive or stuck? Is your shame authentic to you, or is it foreign shame that comes from authority figures, social training, toxic ideas, or the media? (The skill of Burning Contracts is a specific healing for foreign guilt and shame).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guilt and shame are two of the most important emotions that help you mature into a well-regulated person. They help you understand yourself and your actions, and they help you honorably monitor your behavior, emotions, thoughts, and physical desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guilt is the knowledge and acknowledgment of wrongdoing. It is a state of circumstance, and you are either guilty or not guilty in relation to the legal or moral code you value. You cannot feel guilty, because guilt is a concrete state, not an emotional one. Shame is the natural emotional consequence of guilt and wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When shame arises in response to your own authentic and addressable flaws or missteps, it flows appropriately. If you welcome your appropriate shame, you’ll stop yourself before you do something crazy, before you say the wrong thing, or before you enter into unhealthy behaviors or relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we don’t have a healthy connection to our own shame, we’re often coerced into embodying other people’s ideas of right and wrong. This can lead to an incoherent shame spiral, where we’re simultaneously drawn toward and repelled by shameful and forbidden behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can identify your authentic shame, you’ll be able to brighten and define your boundary, ground yourself firmly, call your intellect into the situation, and examine (and destroy) the contracts that are attached to any excessive or inauthentic shame you might carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can honor and welcome your shame, it will give you the strength you need to address your ill-considered behaviors and to throw off the foreign tyrannies that disrupt your authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your shame arises in the presence of others, it’s important to stop, ground yourself, and focus on it. If you can openly welcome your shame, it will recede naturally and swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re grounded and centered within your vibrant, shame-supported boundary, the heat and intensity that shame carries will give you the energy you need to shine a spotlight on your own behavior and examine your contracts with whatever has brought your shame forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re channeling rapids-level manufactured or trapped shame, each of your skills will help you remain stable. Your grounding will help you release any shame trapped in your body or your psyche, your inner focus will give you a private place from which to operate when your whole being is aflame, and your ability to burn contracts will help you identify and release any trapped shame messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re coming out of a shame spiral, it’s important to replace your old, shame-based titles and labels with empowering phrases. For instance, if your smoking bothers you, and your habitual phrase is I can’t stop smoking! I’ve tried a hundred times. I’m just an addict! you can change your words into forceful ones and assert, I won’t stop smoking! I refuse to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t find a lot of shaming titles in your psyche, but you still struggle with repetitive shame, you may have boundary trouble. When your boundary is weak or unsuitably inflated, you may tend to enmesh with others simply because your personal boundary isn’t well-defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to help your children connect to their authentic shame in healthy ways. This can be done by letting them be involved in setting punishments for their misdeeds. When they can be involved in deciding upon their acts of contrition, they can connect to their shame in healthy ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all become so used to dealing with shame that we don’t even recognize it when it arises. It is so vital to the sanctity of the soul that when it is released, it will work unceasingly to expose inferiorities and restore integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HATRED: The Profound Mirror&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Hatred arises in the presence of shadow material (things you cannot accept in yourself, and demonize in others). Shadow work helps you reintegrate and detoxify this material so that it no longer activates your hatred program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Intense awareness ~ Piercing vision ~ Sudden evolution ~ Shadow work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: What has fallen into my shadow? What must be reintegrated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: If you feel comfortable, talk about some of your hatreds in the group. What do you think your hate targets say about the unlived and unconscious parts of you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatred is a natural and healthy emotion, but it can also be used to alert you to specific interior issues that hinder and endanger you. It is not mere dislike, which goes away when you separate yourself from people who behave badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow is the portion of the psyche that we are not aware of, because we deny it. It holds our squelched impulses, our unfelt emotions, our unacceptable behaviors, and our unlived dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the right to feel hatred. It is a sign that something is wrong with you if you can’t feel it. Hatred is a powerful tool that can help you move through difficult issues and catapult yourself into new levels of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we express hatred, we fool ourselves into thinking that we’re completely separate from our hate targets. But in reality, we’re depending on them to live out parts of our own shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we project our material onto others, we lose our integrity, our honor, and our skills. When we project our shadow material onto others, we often can’t work with it in straightforward ways, so we project it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we find people who can really live out our unwanted material – our selfishness, our power, our arrogance, our brilliance, our ignorance, and our sexual appetites – there is a bacchanal in our souls. We are mesmerized and fascinated, and we can’t take our eyes off of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we enforce these shadowy contracts with others, our boundaries are stripped, our focus is thrown outside of ourselves, and our villages are in complete disarray. We also dishonor our targets, whether we hate them or adore them, because we force them to become something other than human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are in a hatred spiral with someone, you need a strong and disruptive emotion to separate yourself and rebuild your boundary from scratch. This is no time for gentleness; you need the big guns. So go ahead and flame on - it will heal your boundary, your behavior, and your relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’ve burned a few contracts with your hate target, you’re ready to move on to the real work of understanding what makes your hate partner so odious. You may want to get a pen and paper, because if you can write out the qualities that make your hate partner so repugnant, you’ll gain tremendous clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hate, your soul is ready to do some of the deepest work you’ll ever experience. Do yourself and everyone around you a favor: get into a conscious relationship with your hatred and your projections. Don’t repress your hatred, don’t explode with it, and don’t try to erase it by shellacking fraudulent acceptance on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEAR: Intuition &amp;#x26; Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Fear arises to orient you to change, novelty, or possible physical hazards. Fear focuses on the present moment and your immediate surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Intuition ~ Instinct ~ Focus ~ Clarity ~ Attentiveness ~ Readiness ~ Vigor. Ability to react skillfully to stimuli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: What action should be taken?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: What are your reactions to the things we’ve all been taught about fear? Have you ever heard any positive messages about fear? Think about times when your fear has worked well for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t recognize fear as the innate ability to act, move, react, and change our behavior based on the input we receive. We call fear our horse sense, our gut instincts, our little birdie, or even our guardian angel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your emotional realm is healthy, your anger and fear work together to keep you safe and sound. However, when your emotional realm is unhealthy, this is almost exactly the way your anger and fear work together: when your boundary is decayed, ignored, and poorly maintained because you don’t honor your anger, your fears will have to become hypervigilant and overly activated just to keep you upright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have no boundary, you’ll be unable to monitor your behavior or identify proper behavior in others, and you’ll be vulnerable most of the time. Without a strong boundary, you may experience amorphous anxieties, you may attack people verbally or physically, or accuse them of plotting against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your flowing fear is allowed to take its secure and proper position inside your well-defined boundaries, it will bring you an instinctive sense of readiness, focus, calm, and vigor. In fact, you won’t seem fearful at all, just as you won’t appear angry when you set your boundary properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is not cowardice. It is the protective mechanism inside you that knows you’re not adequately prepared for whatever comes next. When you ask your fear the internal question, What action should be taken. your fear will tell you in no uncertain terms: Stand still. Run! Speak out. Remain silent. Duck! Fade into the background. Walk forcefully. Move quickly to the left. Look stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can channel your fear properly, it will contribute a sense of self-preservation while it pushes you to study, prepare, and renew your understanding of courage as the capacity to live life on your own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is your body’s way of telling you that something is wrong. It helps you know when you’re about to take on a new job, a new love affair, or any new direction in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access your fear, you must ground and focus yourself inside your sacred space. When you have free access to your fear, you’ll tend to be calm and relaxed most of the time because your intuition will be fully activated, which means you’ll be able to avoid unnecessary dangers without much effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you allow your fear to instruct your behavior, you may find yourself acting in unaccustomed ways. For example, you may fight back or deal with the situation when you’re actually very gentle. When your life is at stake, your fear will cause you to act in lifesaving ways that might never occur to you in a normal situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can see your flashbacks as brilliant survival tools, they can become fun and comical. You can move from a broken-down victim position into a powerful survivor stance. Your fear can contribute an agile, resourceful, and humorous Jackie Chan stance that will help you see yourself in an entirely new light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fears of the future can be worked with in the same way. If you can preplay fearful events in your mind, you can prepare yourself for any number of win-win scenarios before they happen. Fear knows that this world is full of dangers and novel situations, and it wants to prepare you for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with fear in others, it is important to treat them not as weaklings or overly reactive beings, but as intuitive people whose instincts have become activated. If you can shift your attitude, you can help these people connect to their intuitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When fear is welcomed and respected, it alerts people to danger or novelty, prepares them to act decisively, contributes the energy they need to complete whichever action works best in each situation, and then retreats to its watchful free-flowing state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of anxiety. The first is a constant sense of dread, wariness, nervousness, and apprehension that arises when we’re clogged with rejected and dishonored fears. The second is a nagging sense of disturbance or distress when you have no precise information to grab hold of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intuitive and instinctual emotion of fear is a warning signal that needs to be listened to. It can save your life. Worry and anxieties are not always linked to physical danger, but they always try to get your attention for crucial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORRY &amp;#x26; ANXIETY: Focus &amp;#x26; Completion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Worry and anxiety arise to help you organize, plan for, and complete your tasks – both are related to fear, but they arise to help you orient to possible upcoming change, novelty, or hazard. Bonus: If you feel anxiety or worry, you’ll know that there is nothing to fear in the present moment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Foresight ~ Focus ~ Conscience ~ Task-completion ~ Procrastination alert!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: What triggered this feeling? What truly needs to be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re constantly anxious, pay attention to your grounding. Connecting yourself to the earth and off-loading your tension is a great way to calm and focus yourself so that you can feel safe. If you struggle with anxiety, you’ll often experience chemical disturbances due to an increase in adrenaline, cortisol, and related hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re coming out of an anxiety trance, your personal space can become small and puny in response to your lack of usable instincts. Pouring your anxiety into your personal space will help your body relax and heal itself, but it will also fill your personal space with enough energy to restore itself to its proper size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people are stuck in the territory of worry and anxiety, they are near their fears but not yet able to work with them consciously. To help them create sacred space for their anxieties, you can support them in tracking their way back to their true fears and their ability to act decisively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONFUSION: The Mask for Fear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Confusion is a mask for fear and anxiety, and it arises when you are overwhelmed by change, novelty, or too many tasks. Confusion can be a lovely vacation from overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Diffused awareness ~ Innocence ~ Malleability ~ Taking a time-out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: What is my intention? What action should be taken?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Are there situations or relationships in which you regularly feel confused or indecisive? How might your confusion be protecting you in these situations or relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re confused, you’ll find yourself dithering, changing your mind constantly, and being nearly unable to focus or ground yourself. Confusion is a form of dissociation that takes you out of commission when you’ve lost your way. It’s a bit like apathy, which is also a masking state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re confused, ask yourself what your intention is. Don’t focus on which direction you should go in, what choice you should make, or what thing you should do, but on what your intention is. Your confusion will stop you when you’re not following your instincts or your flowing fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re confused, it’s important to understand that something aware inside you is working on your behalf. If you can stop yourself and reassess your position when your confusion arises, you’ll be able to connect to that awareness and find your way back to the center of your meaningful, whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to help others honor their confusion, as you may be tempted to take an incorrect position as the knower of all things and the giver of all answers. Instead, help them honor their need for a time-out and support them in regaining their instincts, decisiveness, and ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEALOUSY: Relational Radar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Jealousy arises when your connection to love, mate-retention, or loyalty is threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Fairness ~ Commitment ~ Security ~ Connection ~ Loyalty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: What has been betrayed? What must be healed and restored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: What do your jealousy and envy tell you about what you may be missing, wanting, or needing in your life? Karla has said that a great question to ask jealousy and envy in order to help them focus on the entire situation and everyone’s needs is: “What would be fair?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jealousy and envy are separate emotional states, but they both arise in response to unfaithfulness or deceit in an intimate relationship. They are a mixture of anger and fear, and they attempt to set or restore lost boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jealousy is a combination of intuition and self-protection that arises in its mood state when your most important relationships are threatened. Intimacy and security in intimate relationships is extremely important to your health and well-being, so much so that you’ll feel physically threatened when you sense betrayal from your mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your partner is unreliable, or your position as the primary focus of your partner is threatened, your jealousy will be a natural and healthy response. However, if you don’t listen to and honor your jealousy, it will tend to drag you into a feedback loop that can make your life uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jealousy is a form of anger that you’ve been holding onto, and it’s time to let it go and channel it into your boundary. Channeling your jealousy into your boundary will help strengthen it, and then you can address your shock and diminishment with renewed strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re done with your jealousy, thank it and let it know it’s welcome in the future to help you choose, maintain, and watch over the most important relationships in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jealousy is a common emotion, and while it may be difficult to deal with, it is not disordered. It is your job to restore your boundaries, intuition, and ability to choose devoted relationships, not to forever rid yourself of the healing force of jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can help people honor and listen to their jealousy, you’ll perform a great healing service. If you try to argue or shame people out of their jealousy, you’ll disable their instincts and their boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENVY: Interactional Radar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Envy arises when your connection to material security, resources, or recognition is threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Fairness ~ Security ~ Access to resources ~ Proper recognition ~ Self-preservation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: What has been betrayed? What must be made right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envy is similar to jealousy in that it is a mixture of boundary-restoring anger and intuitive fear. It alerts you to the risks to your position and security in your social group, but it does so in connection to the fair and equitable distribution of resources and recognition, rather than threats to your reproductive survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envy is a powerful emotion that can lead to the destruction of your boundaries, your intuition, and your effectiveness. It is easy to see why envy has such a bad reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envy, when properly honored and channeled, helps you understand social structures and work within them or leave them behind if you cannot work within them. It gives you the internal security and intuition you need to meet and respond to the many threats and sudden changes you’ll experience in your quest for resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can accept the intense anger inside envy and move it out of your body, you’ll be able to calm yourself enough to focus and access the intuition envy carries with it. When you can treat your behaviors as strategies, you’ll be able to explore and amend them in favor of newer strategies that may fit into your present-day social situation in more advantageous ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re done with the exercise, bless your envy and place it in your emotional realm. It will give you the inner strength and awareness you need to observe and even celebrate the gains and recognitions of others while you nurture your own connections to resources, social support, and recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still stuck on envy, you may need to see a therapist. envy is a powerful emotion, and it can throw you into the rapids if you aren’t careful. It can also be caused by a childhood that twisted your envy into greed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envy is the emotion that arises in response to a threat to your social standing and resources. It can be difficult to work with, because it often goes along with shame, which many people have difficulty dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PANIC AND TERROR: Frozen Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Panic and terror arise when your physical life is directly and immediately threatened. You have three choices: Fight, flee, or freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Sudden energy ~ Fixed attention ~ Absolute stillness ~ Healing from trauma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS (during the emergency): Just listen to your body – don’t think, just react. Your body is a survival expert, and it will keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS (for PTSD): What has been frozen in time? What healing action must be taken?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Panic and terror arise to literally save your life. Have there been times where you’ve experienced the lifesaving gifts of panic or terror? If you’d like to share with the group, please be careful to tell your story in a non-dramatic way so that you don’t overwhelm your group mates. For instance, don’t get into gory details – just note the traumatic incident (i.e., car crash, injury, betrayal), and focus on which of the three responses your panic selected to save your life: fight, flee, or freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freezing is a response that helps us survive dangerous or traumatizing situations. It can dull our senses to excruciating pain, protect us from overwhelming stimuli, and present a corpselike demeanor to our attackers. However, in the aftermath of panic and terror, there’s so much activation that it’s difficult to revisit, renegotiate, and integrate the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t track your panic attacks back to a trauma, it may be because we train ourselves to ignore and dissociate from our thoughts, emotions, dreams, and even our physical sensations. If you’re a sensitive person and you’ve become dissociated in response to this relentless assault, your psyche will need to revisit each instance of dissociation in order to help you reintegrate yourself and come back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your terror and panic are activated in response to trauma, they move forward to increase your adrenaline in case you have the chance to fight or flee at any time during your ordeal. They help you freeze and release heightened amounts of painkilling endorphins so you’ll be more likely to survive any injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re being treated for panic attacks, you should focus on your grounding skills so that you can release some of the activated energy that’s trapped in your body. You should also avoid stimulants, which will help you calm and heal your overworked adrenals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re in the territory of panic, you may have a lot of energy stored in your body. Before you enter a flashback, it’s helpful to pour this energy into your boundaries and your personal space. This helps you calm your body and revitalize your boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you’ve worked through a panic cycle, it’s important to refill yourself consciously. This will help your stasis tendencies refill you in the way they usually do, which is not always consciously. You must refill yourself consciously so that your movements into stasis are as conscious as your movements into change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SADNESS: The Water Bearer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Sadness arises when it’s time to let go of something that isn’t working anyway. If you can truly let go, relaxation and rejuvenation will surely follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Release ~ Fluidity ~ Grounding ~ Relaxation ~ Rejuvenation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: What must be released? What must be rejuvenated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Do you welcome your sadness and give it the time it needs to ground you and help you let go of things that no longer serve you? Or do you try to avoid, repress, or rush through sadness – so that it never has the chance to bring relaxation and rejuvenation to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadness is your psyche’s water-bearer. It helps you slow down and feel your losses, and it helps you release what needs to be released. It helps you trust in the flow of time, in the surprising flow of vision and inspiration, and in the ebb and flow of human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you move into the softened releasing posture of sadness, you can uncouple yourself from the ideas, situations, or people you’ve outgrown or whom you attached to with improper intent. Sadness moves forward to question your outdated or hollow attachments in a slow and persistent manner, and it asks you to release them back into the flow of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your anger and your sadness are harmonized in your psyche, they can help you release outworn ideas or unworkable relationships while you restore your authentic purpose. When you release dead weight and restore yourself to a focused and upright position, you’ll feel rejuvenated and wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your anger will protect you from experiencing your sadness unless you’re safe enough to do so. Your anger knows that sadness is real soul-work, and it won’t allow you to move into it until you’re safe enough to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can dance with your anger and sadness, you won’t second-guess or wrestle with any anger that arises in front of your sadness. You’ll realize that anger actually exists to strengthen you when your boundary and self-image are challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who lead with sadness are often children of raging or addicted parents. They have experienced firsthand the horrors committed in the name of anger, and as a result, they have completely dropped their anger. However, this is not a condition, but a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who lead with sadness often struggle with physical and emotional instability, cycling depressions and anxieties, unworkable relationships, and excruciating loneliness. They must realize that leading with their survival skills instead of their authentic emotions ensures that they will remain in survival mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice for sadness is simple: you just stop, drop into yourself, and set your boundary strongly as you ask the internal questions, What must be released. and What must be rejuvenated. Sadness brings incredible healing energies with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re inflexible and desiccated, you need to bring flow and relaxation back to your life. When you’re tense and stagnant, you must move toward joy and happiness, which cannot and will not heal you. When you require deep relaxation and deep release, you must move honorably and meaningfully into sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we encounter sadness, we usually try to make the person around us smile. However, very few people are given the time or permission to feel truly sad. We dry their tears, hug them, and make jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadness is a natural emotion that helps you deal with specific situations, and it helps you rejuvenate and renew before moving on. However, if you can ask your body to don the posture of despair, you’ll immediately feel the difference between it and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your sadness is trapped, your mind and body will become clogged, and you’ll probably dissociate to get away from the whole mess. When you can break through despair and restore your flow, you’ll be able to live again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRIEF: The Deep River of the Soul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Grief arises when something has been lost irretrievably or when someone has died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: If you can’t move into your grief, you’ll only experience destabilization and dissociation in response to the shock of loss, injustice, inequity, and death, instead of being cleansed and renewed in the river of all souls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: What must be mourned? What must be released completely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Grief is not openly supported by most people, except in funeral rituals. However, funerals can be stilted, shallow, or too rushed to allow people to grieve fully. As you think back to a recent death or loss, were you able to grieve fully? Or is your grief still lingering and waiting to support you in utterly letting go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grief is a beautiful, languid, and powerful emotion that arises when death occurs. It drops you into the river of all souls, and it transports you to the deepest places when you have no choice but to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grief is the deep river of the soul, and it is the soul I mean when I say that grief is the deep river of the soul. It is the fully resourced village that incorporates and integrates our bodies, all of our emotions, all of our multiple intelligences, and all of our dreams and visions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t escape our grief by numbing ourselves to pain and horror with violent entertainment. When we take off our armor and wade into the waters of grief, we’ll discover our sacred position in the dance of all souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans have a great deal of primal wisdom about grief because there is a greater preponderance of primal wisdom inside our brains than there is intellectual information. We can access this wisdom through ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you move through your grief, you may feel a tremendous weight upon you. If you can remember that the movement required in grief is downward, you’ll understand the necessity of this heaviness, which anchors you and presses you into your body so that you can feel the weight and the depth of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your grief is stuck simply because it is unfinished, walking yourself through the ritual practice for grief will help you complete your grieving process. Grieving takes its own time, and it won’t leave you until you perform your sacred tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first rule for creating sacred space for grief is not to rush in and pull the mourner out of the river. Grieving people need to be treated as sacred vessels through which the river of life is flowing in all its power and all its beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your grieving process is complete, you should wrap up the shrine and transport your dead into the next world. Then, you should dismantle your shrine and place the photos and items in new configurations. Remember to include your ancestors in your life by talking or singing to them, asking them questions, or praying to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SITUATIONAL DEPRESSION: Ingenious Stagnation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Situational depression arises when some aspect of your life is unworkable or dysfunctional; depression stops you for a vital reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: The Ingenious Stop Sign of the Soul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL QUESTIONS: Where has my energy gone? Why was it sent away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Important note: Please study the different forms of depression on pages 328-330 in The Language of Emotions; many require therapeutic and/or medical intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Karla makes a distinction between situational depression and the more serious forms of depression (see pages 329-330). If you have worked with your own situational depression (which restricts your energy for important reasons), what did you find to be helpful? What didn’t work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a constellation of emotions, postures, decisions, and health issues that erect what I call the brilliant stop sign of the soul. It is important to understand the difference between despair, which arises when your natural sadness has become blocked or trapped, and depression, which is a cyclical and unresolving movement through any number of blocked or overemphasized emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;untreated depressions can lead to brain damage, so it is important to get help. They can also lead to cycling anxieties, phobias, or OCD symptoms, which require a different form of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;situational depression is the form of depression most of us experience. It is when we feel down and sad about specific events, but not about everything. It is easily treated with the depression practice in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Situational depression is a rapids-level emotion that arises when we disconnect our elements and intelligences from one another. It is a protective and self-respecting response to the internal, familial, social, financial, and political decay and injustice we face every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took 20 years to address my depression, and when I finally did, I was surprised to find that it wasn’t attacking me, but sending parts of my soul away to safety. I realized that my depression was simply trying to save my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your soul’s task isn’t to erase your depression and keep walking; it is to understand your necessary movement into stagnation and address your depression as a peer instead of a combatant. Your sacred task is to end the war between your elements, clear away the rubble, and make a home that the children of your soul would want to come back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re in a depression, it’s difficult to focus on anything because your depression sucks all your energy away. The first movement of depression is a postural change, and it’s important to listen to your depression and bow your head. In most cases, one or both of your airy logic and your fiery vision will tend to dominate, which will throw your earthy body and watery emotions into disarray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can ground and integrate yourself, you’ll be able to differentiate between the many emotional states trapped inside your depression. You’ll be able to feel the difference between sadness and despair, between grief and world-weariness, between anxiety and healthy fear, and between apathy and an urge to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to coming out of a depressive spiral is to treat activity and rest as equally important things. If you’re depressed and inactive, you should begin exercising gently and work your way back to fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also important for your emotional and physical health, and many studies have shown that sleep disruptions and sleep deprivation contribute to depression and hormonal and chemical imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a result of an internal imbalance that diminishes your emotional agility and your ability to feel any emotion properly. It steps in when your intellect and your emotions are at each other’s throats, when you fly over your emotions and batter them with logic, or when your body trammels toward meeting its needs for food, sex, and more stuff without any emotional, spiritual, or logical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is not caused by simply being unhappy, but by fighting an exhausting battle that impedes your ability to act conscientiously. If you were to simply add more happiness to your system, your actions would be damaging to you and everyone around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re in the midst of depression, it’s hard to believe that anything can be done to help the world become a better place. But when you take your depression personally enough to get to work, you’ll begin to alleviate your own depression, and the trouble in our culture will begin to ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to distinguish between depression that is actually stuck, and depression that isn’t quite through yet because you’ve still got imbalances to deal with. If you’re meeting your depression in as many ways as you can, but it just won’t move at all, see a doctor or therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a serious and life-threatening illness, and it’s important to recognize that people with depression may not be able to handle your help. Remember to welcome your depression as a signal of imbalance in your separate elements and intelligences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUICIDAL URGES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: when suicidal urges arise, it can mean that something integral to your identity (an idea, a behavior, a relationship, a job, etc.) has become intolerable and needs to end completely – to die. However, you don’t need to die. We need you here!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: energy to wrench yourself bodily, emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually out of a situation that is killing you already&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL STATEMENT: What idea or behavior must end now? What can no longer be tolerated in my soul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: If you feel comfortable with the subject, share a situation in which you felt suicidal urges. Since you survived, what helped you? Were you able to identify the intolerable situation that needed to end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve turned to this chapter after gathering your skills in all the emotions leading up to this one, you’re ready to approach suicidal urges. They should only be approached when you’re comfortable inside your vibrantly blazing boundary and have access to therapeutic support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last resort of a soul in torment is to suicide, when your brain chemistry or untreated sleep disorders have thoroughly destabilized you. Suicidal urges arise when your fears have been overwhelmed, your angers have been crushed, your boundaries have been trampled, and you’ve been separated from your sadness and grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can dive into panic, you’ll find incredible power and limitless courage inside it. The same is true of the suicidal urge. When you ask prayerfully what must end and what can no longer be tolerated in your soul, the force inside your suicidal urge will help you perform some of the deepest soul-work you’ll ever experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suicidal urges are not dangerous if you can channel them honorably. They can even comfort you with thoughts of escaping the cruelties of this world and falling into a never-ending sleep. However, the reality of suicide is a complete disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channeling suicidal urges is a complicated process that involves setting a strong boundary, focusing yourself, and then diving into the feelings you’ve been avoiding for so long. It can be a roller-coaster ride, but it gets easier after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked my suicidal urge to come forward, and I felt some darkness, some depression, and some sadness. I then projected dark colors, a watery blue sadness, and a gray depressed feeling into my personal space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to prepare for the difficult stage work ahead of me by dealing with my suicidal urge. I learned that each of my emotions was trying to help me prepare for the stage work, and I understood them better as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to work with your own suicidal urges, you should fire up your boundary and intensify your grounding. Suicidal urges travel with many trapped emotions and traumatic memories, so you should prepare yourself for their intensity by becoming proficient in each of your empathic skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a suicidal urge arises, it brings you the ferocity you need to rescue your soul from hell. Don’t repress your suicidal emotions – use them to destroy your contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After channeling a suicidal urge, you’ll be in a very different place, and you may have a new soul assignment. The channeling of this urge always reconnects you to your dreams and your innate intelligences. With its blessing, you’ll have new information about which elements or intelligences need to be revitalized and integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that suicidal urges are not just literal wishes for death, but signs that something inside you is already threatening your life. Suicidal urges are the darkness before dawn, and it is important to let them have their kill in a sacred, empathic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HAPPINESS: Anticipation &amp;#x26; Possibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Happiness arises to help you look forward to the future with hope and delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Merriment ~ Gaiety ~ Amusement ~ Hope ~ Delight ~ Wonder ~ Playfulness ~ Invigoration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL STATEMENT: Thank you for this lively celebration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: It’s difficult to achieve a balanced relationship with happiness in a culture that chases after it as if it’s a prize. Do you allow your happiness to flow and recede freely, in its own way and in its own time, or have you been taught to chase after it and never let it go? What is your relationship with your happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is the most dangerous emotion, not in and of itself, but because of the way we behave in relation to it. We chase after it, sell our souls for it, and try to cement ourselves into its territory. This exploitation of happiness jeopardizes us because when we refuse to honor any emotion except happiness, our emotional landscapes become stagnant and unbalanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is a difficult emotion for many of us to grasp because it is often paired with the word idiot in some form or fashion. But happiness isn’t ignorance or foolishness; it holds our sense of wonder and anticipation of good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When happiness arises naturally, you should laugh, goof, smile, and dream. Then you should flow into your next task or emotion. If you try to imprison your happiness, you’ll spiral into a forced gaiety that will deaden your entire emotional realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice for all of the happiness-based emotions is simple and infinitely difficult: you acknowledge them, thank them, and then let them go completely. If you force your contentment to be your leading emotional state, you’ll lose your way in a split second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTENTMENT: Pleasure &amp;#x26; Appreciation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Contentment arises to help you look toward yourself with pride and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Enjoyment ~ Satisfaction ~ Self-esteem ~ Renewal ~ Confidence ~ Fulfillment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL STATEMENT: Thank you for renewing my faith in myself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: When was the last time you felt content with yourself? Do you allow yourself to feel and enjoy contentment when you’ve done well or accomplished something? If not, how can you give yourself more credit when it’s due?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contentment is the act of meeting your own expectations and internal moral code, and it arises after an important goal has been accomplished. It comes forward in response to tangible actions and the mastery of clear-cut challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOY: Affinity &amp;#x26; Communion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTION REQUIRED: Joy arises to help you feel a blissful sense of expansiveness and connection to others, to ideas, or to experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIFTS: Expansion ~ Communion ~ Inspiration ~ Splendor ~ Radiance ~ Bliss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERNAL STATEMENT: Thank you for this radiant moment! Be aware: Extreme joy (exhilaration) is a state to approach with care, especially if it cycles with depression or sadness. Repetitive exhilaration or flights of giddy mania may be a sign of emotional dysregulation; please reach out for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Have you ever become too attached to the experience of joy and tried to hold on to it or force it to arise in place of another emotion or experience? If so, how can you develop a more appropriate and empathic relationship with your joy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy is the trickiest and most dangerous of all the happiness-based emotions. It is treated as an orgasmic emotional state, which means that people spend a lot of time working toward it as a goal instead of living consciously and appropriately in relation to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy is a natural human emotion that arises after you’ve come to the end of a long and difficult path. It is not a magical gift from the cosmos, but an emotion that arises when you perform your rejuvenation practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use joy to rejuvenate yourself. It arises naturally when you’ve done honest and strenuous work to arrive at a place of communion with all parts of yourself and the world. Your grounding and integrating task when joy arises is to remind yourself that the hard work is just as beautiful and meaningful as the joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are around people who are imbued with happiness, contentment, or joy, do not interfere with them. Instead, simply enjoy them. This can be difficult if your own relationship with any of these emotions is skewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True happiness, contentment, and joy bring delight into your conscious awareness if you treat each one respectfully. If you try to paste a haunted smile onto your face and throw yourself into a nightmare of never-ending exhilaration, you’ll destabilize every part of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been trying to stay in exhilaration, joy, or whatever they’re calling it this year, don’t be surprised if you’re completely unable to focus. Your healing practice for this territory is the same as the practice for people trapped in depression, because both exhilaration and depression spring from quaternal imbalance, emotional suppression, and avoidance behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;questionsdiscussionsexercises&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#questionsdiscussionsexercises&quot; aria-label=&quot;questionsdiscussionsexercises permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Questions/Discussions/Exercises&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were you hyper-empathic as a child? Did you find animal friends or any other support for your sensitivity and empathic awareness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissociation (the sense that you are separate from your body or the current situation) is an ability we all have. For instance, you dissociate naturally when you daydream. Have you experienced situations in which dissociation was helpful to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you experienced a sea change in your life, where you realized that you had been mistaken, or that you had been involved in something that no longer felt right? How did you become aware of your need to change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of times when you’ve been told that you were too emotional, or when you felt uncomfortable feeling or expressing emotions in the presence of others. Feel free to share these experiences and talk about how you handled these situations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how you work with your emotions now. Do you express them openly with other people or through activities, or do you repress most of them and keep them inside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 empathic exercises&lt;/strong&gt; (pg 33-36). Each of these exercises intentionally engages with an emotion in its most subtle form. These exercises can help you learn to feel, identify, and befriend your emotions as key aspects of your intelligence, awareness, and social skills – rather than treat them as unwanted things that “happen” to you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karla describes emotions in the different intensity levels of “…their flowing states, their mood-states, and … their “raging rapids” states” (pg. 37). In the exercises above, you experienced the soft and flowing states of sadness, happiness, and fear. Had you ever connected these states to the subtle levels of emotions they contain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share your ideas about how the quaternity model relates to you. What elements are strongest for you right now – and what elements could you integrate into your life more fully?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your judgments about healthy judgment? Share instances where healthy judgments can and should be made. How can healthy judgment support your emotional awareness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about ways that your intellect has overtaken or bullied your emotions into submission. What are ways that you can help your intellect and emotions work together as a team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you find that you already gravitate to practices that support just one or two of your elements? Share ways that you can make room in your daily life for your neglected elements (if any).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would it feel like to begin balancing your elements? Are there relationships that would have to change as you grow and develop into a fifth-element personality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re comfortable, share some of the ways you use addictions and distractions currently. What do these practices bring to your life? How do they support you? How do they hinder you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re comfortable, share some of the roots of your addictive or distracting behaviors. What are some of the ways you can shift these behaviors and start feeling the emotions hiding behind them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you track Mr. Bunny through our culture? Are there shared practices, traditions, recreational activities, or accepted behaviors that are actually some form of Mr. Bunny?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel comfortable sharing, what are the dissociative practices you might use to deal with trauma? If the group would like to explore this topic more deeply, you can discuss the rest of the chapter and, specifically,the three responses to trauma on pages 95-98, and the three stages of trauma and initiation on pages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your group is comfortable, you can talk about any repetitive emotions that are trying to get your attention. What gifts and awareness are these emotions trying to bring to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’ve survived trauma or not, have you experienced the healthy, boundary-restoring aspects of your anger and the intuitive and instinctual aspects of your fear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have you been told about forgiveness? Does your current concept of forgiveness include healthy anger, as it should? If not, how can you can responsibly channel your anger and work with forgiveness in a healthy and empathic way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you experienced deep and lasting love – such as the healthy love of a parent and child, or the dedicated and adoring love of a pet? How is that type of love different from the volatility of romantic love and crushes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try out this practice as a group and share what it feels like to ground yourself. Is this grounded state natural for you, or does it feel very unusual?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like to burn any of the old contracts you’ve made with yourself or others? Are there old behaviors that feel entrapping, or that you’d like to change? If you’ve already tried this practice on your own, share your experiences with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss the difference between Conscious Complaining and positive affirmations (see pages 149-151). If you’ve already tried this practice on your own, share your experiences with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What rejuvenates you and brings you a sense of calm and renewal? Do you have any regular rejuvenation practices now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before delving into the emotions one by one, are there any emotions that you’d like to understand better or integrate more fully? Also, which emotions do you have a healthy relationship with right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how often you use the word “stress” or “stressed out” to describe any number of emotions – and think about how you can begin to use the actual names of your real emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary rule of emotional flow is this: All emotions are true. All emotions tell the absolute truth, either about the specific situation that brought the emotion into play, or about some area of the psyche…. All emotions are true. This doesn’t mean that all emotions are right or that you should take their word for everything!… Some of your emotional reactions can display prejudices you didn’t know you had, while others can make you lust after things that would damage you; therefore, you don’t just follow your emotions like a fool…. Your task is to welcome that truth and support your emotional flow by bringing a full village of perspectives to each of your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are necessary – even when they’re uncomfortable or socially inappropriate – because they are part of your psyche, a part of your neural network, a part of your socialization, and a part of your humanity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are a source of great resourcefulness. If you can learn to focus and work with the information inside each of your emotion states, you can become intimately connected to the source of your intelligence and heal your most profound wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathy is a powerful tool that can help us understand others, but it can also be a double-edged sword. While empaths are very sensitive and intuitive, they can also get right to the center of any issue, but in a culture that can’t figure out what emotions are, empaths are difficult to understand. I missed the important early stage of turning off my preverbal empathic skills in order to develop the verbal skills of emotional subterfuge. As a result, I could not listen to the dangerous ideas surrounding emotions and accept them. I had to find my own way. Empathic skills allow us to see the world as alive with knowledge and meaning. They help us listen to the meaning underneath words, understand living things and nature, and connect with the world around us.
When we look at things empathically, we drop down underneath the obvious, behind the merely rational, and beneath the surface of what seems to be going on. We must learn to listen to our emotions in order to use them properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family was a mix of intellectual, linguistic, musical, mathematical, and artistic genius. We always had a comfortable relationship with the idea of genius. None of us could envision an emotional person as a genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a very empathetic child, and I could sense what others were feeling even if they didn’t want me to. I could blurt out the true words, point to the actual situation under the social banter, and find the absurdity beneath the seeming normality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time with my cat Tommy Tiger, and I began to see the world through his eyes. I could feel his full-body experience of lounging on a soft lawn in a puddle of sunshine, and I understood where he was growling at the neighborhood dogs who had no manners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the security and quiet I needed to think about humans and their bizarre behaviors. I began to empathize with them, and came to view humankind and human interactions in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My empathic skills were an ingenious survival response. I experienced the emotions of others as if they were my own, and I endured full-body contact with others that made me see and feel their emotions as if they were real, physical things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no social or sensory filters, and I was constantly perceiving and feeling people’s emotions. I was just on fire most of the time. I tried to process all the emotional content, but I worked almost completely in the dark because I didn’t know how to explain my perceptions to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissociation is a natural response to overwhelming stimuli, but for many traumatized people, the tangent goes on and on. They have little connection to life in the everyday world.
I could leave the world of suffering behind when I dissociated. I felt a sense of lightness and peace, and I met angels and guides who lived in an alternate, deeply meaningful spiritual world just beside this one.
I became known as the animal girl, and I would go up to fierce dogs and pet them. I learned to be quieter and more still, and I let the living or the dying happen on its own. I learned to be calm and patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many forms of spiritualism and metaphysics exert a strong pull on dissociated trauma survivors, who form a significant part of our population. Dissociative, out-of-body spiritual practices can be very attractive to trauma survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned how to help people get reassociated into their bodies, and I focused on that aspect of my healing practice. I knew what to do, it was the same process as with traumatized cats, dogs, and birds. I created a safe, warm, and quiet environment, and I stayed with people until they were reintegrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that emotions are extremely versatile and healing. They help us survive and navigate our way through life. They are fluid, ever-changing, and they carry massive amounts of information with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must bring all parts of ourselves to the process of healing ourselves and others, or any important process. When we can stand balanced and upright at the center of our lives, we won’t be just intelligent about emotions, but also inquiring explorers who can bring new awareness to their deepest issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good emotions and bad emotions, and they are usually taught to us from a young age. Good emotions are happiness, pleasantness, joy, and some forms of sadness. Bad emotions are sadness that lasts too long, depression, anger, peevishness, righteous indignation, wrath, and rage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are a very important part of our lives, and we should treat them that way. They are not good or bad, but rather a rich and brilliant continuum of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are a part of your psyche, a part of your neural network, and a part of your socialization. They are not the enemy, but they have come to be vilified because empathic awareness is so uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathic work teaches us to find the middle ground between vilifying and glorifying our emotions, and between expressing and repressing them. When we can see all of our emotions as vital tools, we can invite them into a conscious and supportive dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we express our emotions, we hand them over to the outside world, where we hope they’ll be noticed, honored, and transformed. But emotional expression can make us dependent on external action, books, friends, and family. If these external supports are not available to us, we might not be able to process our feelings.
We must learn to honor and attend to our emotions in a deeper, more mature, and more evolved way. We must learn not to work against the emotions with repression or for the emotions with incompetent expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can channel your emotions, you’ll discover that each of your emotions contains vital skills and abilities that help you survive and thrive. Your emotions don’t disappear when you’re not feeling them; instead, they move through you at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadness is an internal emotion that brings you back to yourself and makes you aware of your interior state. It helps you release uncomfortable things you’ve been grasping on to, like muscle tension, fatigue, lost hopes, or disappointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you smile, you can bring your happiness forward and share it with others. Happiness is a good emotion to share with others if it’s the right time to be happy. It’s also an emotion that tends to arise naturally when you’ve done good work with some of your deeper emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is your instincts and intuition, and it helps you focus on your internal knowledge and your surroundings. It helps you stand upright in your body and lean forward a bit, to bring your instincts and intuition to the moment.
We need to be able to identify our emotions, understand them, and begin to communicate with them empathically instead of being at their mercy or treating them cruelly. We must look deeply into accepted wisdom about the emotions and clear away the nonsense that threatens to stupefy us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathy is a normal human skill that allows us to read the interior state, intentions, emotions, desires, and possible actions of other people or animals. It is one of the multiple kinds of intelligence we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empaths are often thought of as being only logical and spatial, but these are not the only forms of intelligence. Empaths are also linguistic, bodily, and artistic. They are able to access all of their intelligences, but they may not receive direct instruction in regard to their emotions, interpersonal skills, or intrapersonal skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were never taught how to identify our emotions or work with them effectively. We were instead taught to act out our anger and sadness, which would take us out of the normal school day and make us targets for the other kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-element theory is a way to understand the world that was developed to help us understand the emotions. It is not a scientific one, but it is a mythological and poetic framework that helps us understand the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can allow your emotions to flow as water does, and if you can respond to them honorably, you can create balance within yourself. Allowing your emotions to flow naturally is the foundation of the ability to channel emotions properly and skillfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you welcome and attend to your fear and anger, they won’t endanger you or the other driver. They’ll simply help you increase your awareness and skill. When you allow your emotions to flow freely, they bring life-affirming water and empathic awareness into your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-element model helps us understand how our lives function or malfunction when any element is out of balance. We must balance our emotions if we want to experience them in brilliant ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to be able to rely on our physical skills when emotions arise, we must know how our emotions and our body interrelate. If we want to be able to think quickly and process our emotions intelligently, we must understand the ideas we have about our emotions and our intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that judgment stops you from experiencing life fully is false. Judgment is the ability to react as an individual and use your discerning intelligence freely. We need to rescue our much-wronged ability to judge and bring it back to a place of honor at the center of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy judgment is a combination of your airy intellect and your watery emotions coming together to form a considered opinion. It helps you define yourself in the world and separate the wheat from the chaff. This process of definition keeps you focused and centered. It’s an internal decision-making process about what a thing is and whether it suits you or not…. Thoughts and emotions are partners. They’re not enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intellect is extremely important and useful, but it was never meant to perform the Herculean tasks we’ve forced upon it in our airy, logical-intelligence-only society. We must understand the interplay between the intellect and the other three elements in the quaternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A functional quaternity helps us understand and deal with our emotions. When our emotional state is named and understood intellectually, we can work with it properly. When our logical intelligences and our emotional intelligences can work together, we become able to feel and think about things consciously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the body and spirit are at odds, and the portaging abilities of the emotions are ignored by both, the intellect will often take a forward position in our psyches. When there is no communication between the elements, and the intellect is forced to take a forward position, we’ll think too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could get a sense for each job, you’d have a clearer sense of which one made more sense for you. Your emotions could help you feel the difference between the two jobs and the two towns, and this would help your body feel the visceral differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can balance your four elements, your intellect will be able to work together with your emotions. When you can allow your emotions to flow, you’ll free your beleaguered intellect from the impossible task of ruling your entire life without support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work with your emotions empathically, you must bring all parts of yourself into the process and into balance. Bringing balance to your system means welcoming each of your elements and intelligences into the whole of your psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the function of each of your elements helps you self-diagnose your personal imbalances. If you can’t get things done, if you dream or wish for things you can never make happen in this world, then you’ll know your earth element is being neglected. If you can’t figure things out and nothing makes sense, you’ll know your air element isn’t being allowed to take its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your earth element is out of balance, you should move into physical activity, nutrition, and rest. Restoring balance to your earth element means bringing your physical life into consciousness by allowing your body to build, feel, explore, and create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your logical air element is gusting like crazy, you should move into conscious mental activity. Study, read, learn a language, or research things that interest you. If you don’t like to read and research, you can do puzzles, play games, or crunch numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your water element is overflowing, you should move into conscious expressive activity. Anything that releases feelings through your body or your mind will help bring your water element back into balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your fire element is raging or dampened, you should move into conscious spiritual or contemplative activity and make room for dreams, intuitions, and visions in your everyday life. Religious observance and meditation can be healing for some, but you’ll also find spiritual healing in nature walks, time spent with animals, children, and elders, and any time spent by a body of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can bring your emotional aspects, your intellectual gifts, your bodily skills and strengths, and your visionary spirit into respectful peer relationships, you’ll be able to dance in the realm of brilliance. When the five elements are in balance, a new element arises: nature, wood, or ether in various wisdom traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you live in an unbalanced quaternity, you’ll consistently forget to act or think or feel or dream. Your personality will be alternately flat or spiky, your ego will swing between utter dejection and utter inflation, and your self-esteem will careen wildly between ungrounded highs and unrealistic lows. But when you can access the grounding and balancing properties of each of your elements and intelligences, you’ll have a stable foundation and a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be a painfully lonely time when you first start to balance your quaternity. You’ll gain immeasurable freedom when you break free from systems and mindsets that keep you blindfolded and hobbled, but you’ll leave many friends and acquaintances behind you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotions live in an element we don’t value and in intelligences we don’t exercise consciously. Moving into the realm of the emotions means moving away from the status quo. If you need support in letting go of old ways of being, repeat the free-flowing sadness exercise in section four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigating is a great example of how the five elements work together. It requires strong logical knowledge of tides and star positions, as well as the ability to fully plot the voyage, but it also relies on earthy strength and competence in canoeing and sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we attempt great or new things, we require great resources inside ourselves. We must have strong checks and balances in our psyches so we don’t become confused in the presence of flow. When we can rely equally on all of our elements and intelligences, we’ll have full and conscious access to everything we need to make decisions and strong movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five elements and their intelligences play a big role in emotions. When you’re asking big questions or attempting big things, you need a big, strong, and balanced center from which to process all the information you gather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balancing tasks are simple in and of themselves, but the process of restoring your psyche to wholeness can be a hurdle. It is easy to become distracted by your balancing practices, and fall into the trap of using them instead of the skills and abilities they represent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your fully resourced personality can help you remain whole even when trouble is present. When you’re whole, you can weather the hard times and the harsh places because you’ll have a functional and multifaceted nature self at the center of your psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we don’t have a conscious and deliberate relationship with our free-flowing emotions, we won’t understand the necessity of flow. We fight the idea of flow, and instead try to live in a benumbed version of peace and quiet as tension builds up inside us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we assume that flow and emotions are a problem, we’ll start problem-solving and end up with a solution based on our assumption that flow and emotions equal trouble and disease. But when we instead accept our flowing emotions as necessary and irreplaceable, we won’t need to solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving toward balance means moving away from distractions, addictions, and avoidance behaviors. However, that movement is uncommon, because distractions are everywhere. We all distract ourselves on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving away from distractions, addictions, and avoidance behaviors means moving away from our utterly distracted society and into our own keeping. This can be difficult, but it helps to understand why we all distract ourselves so much of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reach out for addictions and distractions not because we’re weak or unprincipled, but because something is seriously amiss inside us. When we can observe avoidance, distraction, and addiction from an empathic perspective, we can understand what sorts of relief they give us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain dopers, by forcing their minds to maintain constant focus, are actually reducing their intellectual capacities. The anesthetics, painkillers, cigarettes, heroin, marijuana, excessive reading or TV and movie viewing, and overeating numb the body, the emotions, and the thoughts so that part of us can live in peace and quiet. When we can nurture the village of elements and intelligences inside us, we can respond to the inner and outer world with agility and grace. We can use our eagle natures to help us do a flyover of troubling situations, and listen respectfully to the voice of fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use addictions and distractions to relieve our emotional suffering, we’ll actually cement it. If we don’t understand Spinoza’s premise that suffering will cease when understanding has been reached, we’ll see suffering as an immovable, intractable thing, and we’ll require dissociative substances and practices just to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use any addictive, distracting, or dissociative practices, you don’t need to feel ashamed of yourself or quit cold turkey, but you should know what you’re doing with your distraction of choice and why you’re doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist saying Suffering is discomfort multiplied by resistance applies to our encounters with distractions. If we can just sit with an uncomfortable emotion, we can understand ourselves more deeply. But if we resist the emotion and turn toward avoidance and distraction, we begin to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve created a culture that relies on distraction and avoidance as a way of life. We don’t allow our discomfort to inform us, and we always seek distraction or avoidance instead. This is the defining movement in our training and in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most broken people in a society tell us where our society is most broken. When we’re distracted, we can’t remember that. We can’t see the part we all play in the creation and nurturance of poverty, because we’re distracted by money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must address the underlying motivation for distractions and addictions, which is the need for relief from the discomfort of unhealed trauma. We cannot move forward into the world of emotions until we address trauma seriously, because it severely impacts our lives, families, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of us were deaf, we would expect to see a vastly different society than one where deafness is not so prevalent. If more than half of us could only speak Spanish, we would expect to see a different culture than one where German or English predominates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of trauma is individual. You know it when you see it or experience it. Trauma can occur when you’ve been assaulted or attacked, but it can also occur during surgery or dental procedures, in response to the death of a loved one, or even from witnessing someone else’s trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to see dissociation as a widespread survival skill, not just for the situations we all agree upon as traumatic, but for a vast number of agitating or overwhelming everyday situations. I saw that trauma survivors tended to affect the people around them; they created an atmosphere that provoked dissociation and avoidance behaviors in their circle of friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement of culture has been to separate spirit from body, and mind from emotion. As a result, many of us have poorly moderated quaternities or dissociated personalities. We cannot focus ourselves properly, and our hygiene is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our society is rife with unhealed trauma and unrelieved dissociation. As a result, most of us are not fully aware of how or why we dissociate. We are drawn to the distracted and dissociated behaviors that infect our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When survivors respond to their trauma by traumatizing themselves, they usually repress it and re-create its atmosphere in their inner lives. When they respond to it by traumatizing others, they are simply expressing their trauma onto others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we choose to repress our traumatic material, we repress our emotions as well. When we choose to express our traumatic material and visit it upon others, we are emotional exploders. Neither choice allows us to live full and conscious lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t consider the third response to trauma, which is to channel it from within an awakened psyche and to turn the trauma on its ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that traumatic and dissociative behaviors are universal, and that expression and repression are at the center of the trouble. I brought more vision and emotion into my thought process. I realized that trauma is not the real problem, because it is a fact of life. The issue is not in the danger or in the dissociation, but in the fact that we don’t have the resilience to bring ourselves back to center after a danger has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a chicken-and-egg situation when it comes to how we became unable to resolve trauma. Did we become unable to resolve trauma because we don’t have a fully resourced village inside us, or did we lose access to the village inside us because we don’t understand how to reintegrate ourselves after trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three stages of tribal initiation are being isolated from the known world, having an ordeal or brush with death, and being recognized and welcomed back as an initiated person. Nonindigenous cultures have lost the wholeness of their tribes, while still enjoying the freedom and individuality that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tribal initiation, stage one is an organized, expected removal from the parents and the everyday patterns of the tribe. In trauma, however, there is no preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic stage two is the out-of-control moment of the assault, when the initiate is separated from their spirit and body. There is no organization to the ordeal, and no promise of an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third stage of an initiatory process is when the entire tribe recognizes the new person and welcomes him or her as an initiated and valued member of the tribe. This is why the third stage is so important. Without it, the initiation and the initiate are unfinished, and the tribe is incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we can understand the essence of initiation, we can see that both responses to traumatic initiations, the repressive self-abuse and the expressive abuse of others, are unconscious repetitions of stages one and two. When we cycle unrelieved trauma through our inner or outer world, we’re still in the process of initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In therapy groups and in prison tribes, trauma survivors are moved to a sort of stage three. However, neither welcoming process allows trauma survivors to take their place as respected elders in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the welcoming tribe is made up of people who have experienced similar trauma, initiates often receive the wrong message about belonging and identity. They become survivors of a specific set of circumstances instead of becoming fully initiated adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your fully resourced psyche can be brought to bear on your trauma, the sacred wound at the center of your trauma can be revealed. When your vision and your multiple intelligences can track the trauma’s origins, you can take your honorable place in the currents of time and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we can heal trauma from a fully resourced perspective, we become deeply connected to the center of our selves and to the center of our troubled society. When we are whole, we can see that traumatic avoidance, distraction, and dissociation form the basis for most people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we move from stage two to stage three, we realize that we’re not broken apart by our wounds, but rather, we’re broken open by them. We become more energy, more information, and more love. We become not half-alive survivors of trauma, but beautifully scarred elders, visionaries, and healers of our tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French author and trauma survivor Jean Genet spoke to the heart of this three-stage healing process in his harrowing written account of his own post-traumatic journey, The Thief’s Journal. He said that acts must be carried through to their completion. Whatever their point of departure, the end will be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erasure techniques have some value in extreme post-traumatic responses, but most of us don’t fall into that category. We are taught to function fairly well around our traumas through ingenious avoidance or addictive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we view trauma from a fully resourced perspective, we can understand balance and equilibrium as flowing and malleable things that respond to their environment. We can understand that healing cannot occur until the original wound has been addressed to the satisfaction of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third stage of healing is not a peaceful, anesthetized, or predictable process. It is a vibrant and utterly singular process that creates not mere survivors, but fully initiated soul warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first emotions that arise when people begin healing from distractions, avoidance behaviors, addictions, or traumatic dissociations are anger and fear. Anger and fear are intrinsic to the process of coming back to wholeness. They signal that real healing is underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we tell angry people to drop their real emotions and behave in more manageable ways, we are essentially asking them not to restore their boundaries. In so doing, we make the work of legitimately angry people nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is a beautiful and necessary movement, but it has to be honest and emotional. It can’t be thrown out the window in the guise of forgiveness, because then it becomes incomplete. It must be done honestly and with emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is a decision made by your whole self after your emotional work has been done. It is not an emotion, and it cannot take the place of one. It is a process that creates true separations from torment and tormentors, and true separations require the proper application of boundary-restoring anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is good, but it must be done correctly. It must be performed from the unconscious position of stages one and two, and it must reduce our ability to be present with the pain we feel. When we rush to forgiveness, we lose our connection to our original wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is a practice in itself. It is a gradual process of strengthening and unwinding that helps trauma survivors separate their innate selves from their traumatic behaviors. Real forgiveness frees people and shoots them forward in consciousness, and that kind of movement only occurs in a resourced psyche where the body, the multiple intelligences, and all of the emotions are allowed to move freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is a constant, and it is not an emotion. It is everywhere, and it cannot be found by listening to the language of emotions. Love is constant, and it endures all emotions, trauma, betrayal, divorce, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotion is something different from love. You can be furious with someone you love, frightened of them, and utterly disappointed in them, but the love never wavers. Love lives in a realm far deeper than the emotions, and in that deep and rich place, words don’t carry much meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five empathic skills are body-based, and they help you navigate competently through your emotions, thoughts, sensations, and visions. They rely on the power of imagery, and they help you immediately become more able to access your emotional realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your emotions are in their free-flowing states, it’s a simple thing to work with them. However, when they move to mood states or raging rapids, you can become overwhelmed. These empathic skills will help you maintain your equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can focus your attention on your body in the present moment, you’ll be able to navigate and deal with the flows in each of your elements. When you can ground yourself, you’ll be more capable and confident in the inner and outer worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to maintaining your focus is to accept distractions and avoidance behaviors as normal and necessary. When you can move between clear focus and diffused consciousness, you’ll have equal access to the center of your defined and grounded awareness and to the dreamy and ephemeral parts of your psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your personal space, or your aura, is your personal boundary. It is the space around you that you can feel when people stare at you or when you’re in a crowded elevator. It is the neural and visceral manifestation of your personal space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your personal boundary is the area around your body that is your responsibility. It is your skin, but it is also your imagination, your emotions, and your focus. It is your space in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boundaries are difficult to define and maintain, and that’s normal. But when you do, you’ll be able to avoid enmeshing with people and breaking their boundaries. When you’re properly defined, it becomes easier to be empathic in a non-empathic world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create an emergency boundary by becoming angry or anxious when you’re tired and vulnerable. You can also create a false boundary by using a cloud of cigarette smoke to keep people out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your personal space is a sanctuary of solitude that no other people can enter. It should be filled with images that make you feel whole. It should be clear that no living people or expectations from the outside world are allowed in this sacred place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brightly defined boundary should be in place at all times, because it can be likened to the skin of your proprioceptive body. You wouldn’t allow the skin on your physical body to wither or degrade, so you should keep your boundary healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third skill in this process is burning contracts, which helps you separate yourself from behaviors and attitudes that destabilize you. When you’re grounded, focused, and well-defined, you can view your behaviors not as life sentences, but as inclinations you can choose to support or release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To burn a contract with an idea, behavior, stance, or relationship, begin by focusing and grounding yourself. Illuminate your boundary with a very bright color, and breathe normally. Imagine unrolling a large piece of blank parchment paper right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burning of contracts is the central skill of the emotional channeling process. It allows you to move energy and information from one place to another while you bring your behaviors, attitudes, and stances into your conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you can free yourself from old behaviors, stagnant attitudes, or unworkable relationships, you will no longer require constant distractions, addictions, or avoidance behaviors. When you can bring your entire village to bear on your issues, you’ll regain your resilience and your equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to get into a bad mood or a stagnant place and forget all your skills and emotional wisdom. It is easy to fall into emotional repression and incompetent expression. When this happens, your ignored and mismanaged emotions will intensify and repeat themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of complaining is that it helps you identify your most important work. If you dream constantly of writing, training horses, traveling, going back to school, or becoming a clown, that dream is a clear treasure map that will lead you to your central vocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complaining is a skill that allows you to express your frustrations with the world. It is a way to release pent-up emotions, and it can be done alone or with someone else. It is especially helpful in a life of striving, good works, and personal growth, where complaining is often considered less than saintly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive thinking is the opposite of conscious complaining. It attempts to replace negative thoughts with more positive ones, but this doesn’t address the issues behind the problem. Instead, it simply tells you how to feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive thinking is helpful when it’s true, just as negative thinking is helpful when it’s true. If the phrase I’m wonderful and marvelous! comes barreling out of your psyche, it’s a sign of happiness moving through you in its own way and its own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After burning a contract, it’s important to rejuvenate yourself so that old behaviors don’t re-animate themselves. To do this, you must refill your empty space consciously. If you don’t, it will be filled unconsciously, and you don’t want that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve found a way to rejuvenate and self-soothe, congratulations! This is a wonderful way to call your attention and vitality back from all the places it rushes to. It’s important to maintain a balance between the work you do when you ground and define yourself and channel your emotions, and the work you do when you just let go and enjoy yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you bring your awareness to the activities that loom over you or if your life is imbalanced by them, skip back to the chapter on addictions and see what you might be seeking in these entertainments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is a skill in and of itself. These empathic skills will awaken many sleeping parts of you and allow your emotions to come forward, which will constitute a large change in your inner landscape. If certain skills feel utterly strange or even impossible, pay attention and support those reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have access to one or more of these skills, you can use them in whatever way you see fit. Your rejuvenation practice should be used regularly because we tend to be so forgetful about taking care of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you re-integrate the village inside you, ask your mind to support your emotions with its excellent ability to name and translate things. Ask your body to keep you in touch with your emotions as they move through you. And remember that your goal is wholeness, not perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of the book is dedicated to the emotions. As your awareness deepens, you’ll find that you can’t truly separate your emotions from one another. Your job is not to organize them into neat little compartments, but to welcome their lively energies into your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary rule of emotional flow is that all emotions are true. They tell the absolute truth about either the specific situation that brought the emotion into play or some area of the psyche. When you understand emotions empathically, your emotions won’t threaten or destabilize you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions don’t cause trouble on their own. They simply bring energy and information forward. If you don’t honor them, you’ll not only stop your growth and evolution, but you’ll also cause your emotions to fester and stagnate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining flow in each of your elements isn’t a difficult or time-consuming process. You can maintain your bodily flow throughout your day by simply making circular movements with your wrists or ankles when you’re at your desk, or by yawning, stretching, and vocalizing quietly. You can maintain your intellectual flow by allowing your mind to plan, organize, and scheme freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotions are a wonderful place to practice your empath skills. They are the source of our most powerful experiences, and they are also the source of our most repetitive behaviors. If an emotion just won’t respond to you, or if certain emotional states are repetitive and troubling, reach out for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not healthy to be utterly empathic with everyone you meet. Your emotions should flow in your own life, not in others’. If you maintain a constant, unwavering level of empathic receptivity without any balancing or cleansing practices, your life will become completely disordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with angry people, it’s important to remember that they need protection and not restoration. You should set your own boundary strongly before attempting to intervene. Don’t try to create boundaries for angry people or teach them in any way; interference will only degrade their boundaries further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are like the weather, they come and go. If you’re not able to deal with them, they will repeat themselves. If you’ve got unhealthy beliefs about your emotions, you know what to do: burn your contracts and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are enraged, you are in a state of extreme distress, and your physical and emotional environments must be examined carefully. Your angers may have been building for years, and your jobs or home lives may be unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to pour your rage and fury into your boundary immediately. Their intensity can disrupt your body if you try to repress them. When you’re inside a fierce boundary, you’ll feel all the strength and intensity of your rage and fury without needing to take yourself or others out of commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’ve channeled your rage and fury, you can return to the original conflict because your boundary and self-awareness will be restored, your body and psyche will be cleared out, and you’ll be revitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rage and fury are important emotions for unhealed trauma survivors, as they help them replace what was lost in the trauma. They are fiercely protective emotions that only arise in times of extreme need, and they are necessary for rebuilding devastated boundaries and establishing sacred space for the journey through the three-stage healing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empathic process of trauma healing does not come with maps or guidebooks. It is an intense and unique journey that takes place in the soul’s own time and in the soul’s own way. It is most common for rages and furies to come forward first, but this does not always occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready, you’ll be able to perform this full-body movement to the third stage of initiation. Your first task is to create the sacred space in which that work can occur: channel your angers, rages, and furies into your boundary and into intensified grounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to crumble in the face of this sort of turmoil, which is why skills, support, and sacred space are necessary. Your ability to ground and focus yourself will allow you to halt any distraction or dissociation you experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can welcome your shame, you can begin to identify the different forms it takes. Welcome your free-flowing ability to effortlessly support ethical behaviors in yourself and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still angry after you’ve performed your favorite rejuvenation practice, flip back to the practice for rage and fury in section entitled The Practice for Rage and Fury: The Only Way Out Is Through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very difficult to create sacred space for hatred in other people if they have no skills or awareness. If you can allow people to complain to you, you will provide them with the opportunity to bring all their material forward. This talking is a healing in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do some pre-emptive shadow-retrieval work by writing down all of the qualities you see in someone you adore and in another person you gossip about. Your gossip target will hold shadow for you, just as your adoration target will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is a crucial part of the healing process, but it is often misguidedly connected to hatred. Real forgiveness isn’t about making excuses for people’s horrific behavior, but rather about recognizing that real damage has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of a person can never be stolen, erased, desecrated, or destroyed. It seems to return on the wave of powerful, rapids-level emotions, as if the submerged, shadowy essence of the survivor is sending assistance into the heart of the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you understand the healing and restorative powers of the emotions, you’ll welcome them in whatever form they choose. You won’t demonize any one emotion, and you won’t allow forgiveness to loom above any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can channel your own hatred and retrieve your shadow, you’ll become your whole self again. You’ll become a shadow-fortified (instead of shadow-persecuted) soul warrior who creates peace, true mercy, and honest forgiveness from authentic strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re driving and checking both rearview mirrors, easing out of the way of slowed or speeding cars, signaling your intentions, and making eye contact with other drivers, your flowing fear is at work. Your instincts are fully engaged, and you’re constantly scanning your changing environment for novelties and dangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re working at your office, answering phones, juggling schedules, and tracking down supplies or contractors, your entire being is engaged and focused. You’re scanning through significant amounts of information, altering your behavior in response to changing demands, and ensuring that your business will continue to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t or won’t integrate your frightening experiences, you’ll remain in a constant state of alarm and readiness: your adrenals will pump full-time, and you’ll find yourself jumping, starting, and striking out at everything. Your body won’t be able to relax, your sleep may become disturbed, and your eating habits may fall into disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re reintegrated, you’ll be able to move, think, dream, sleep, feel, laugh, and love again not because you’ve eradicated all traces of trauma from your soul, but because you’re fully resourced and whole again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can help yourself heal and reintegrate by participating in yoga, qigong, and tai chi, as well as dancing, swimming, and sports. Martial arts and self-defense classes teach you the rules of engagement for physical conflicts, which can help you defend yourself in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that physical movement can help heal trauma, as it allows the body to release tension and the mind to process memories. I began moving more like Jax, who was always curious and excited to explore his surroundings, than Rufus, who was always suspicious and afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve survived a trauma, be aware of your movement patterns and frozen or numbed areas in your body. Do not pathologize them or blame yourself for holding on to them. Sealing off painful or damaged areas is a very good coping mechanism because until you have skills, the pains you carry can seem overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you channel despair, you’ll release a massive clog in your psyche. If you’re not grounded and centered, you may be knocked down by the sudden restoration of your flow, so make sure you ground and focus yourself before you begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be extremely difficult to help people who are trapped in a cycle of despair. They have no investment in working through their problems, and they’re not resourced or living in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a cyclical movement through any number of repetitive states, and it often incorporates despair, but it isn’t made of despair alone. Depression is a rich topic that will be explored in detail in chapter 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was always fascinated by death and horror, and I used them to further hone my dissociative skills. I didn’t grieve or mourn when my grandparents died because I was unable to get close to my body or my emotions to feel any loss. I never wailed or cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a primarily intellectual person, and this talk of spirits and the other world sounds like gibberish to you, think of it this way: if you don’t grieve your losses, the people who have died either get erased from your consciousness or they hang around in your psyche as if you’re being haunted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we don’t allow ourselves to grieve, we’re repeatedly traumatized by death. When we refuse to feel the pain of loss, we refuse to honor our connections. We trick ourselves into thinking that we can guard ourselves against all pain if we just refuse to grieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In indigenous wisdom traditions, it is known that if a culture doesn’t properly grieve their loved ones into their death journeys, they cannot properly welcome their children into their life journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritual exists to help us navigate and survive the necessary (and often wrenching) passages of our lives. Without ritual, we lose community and the sacred, as well as our ability to live, love, feel, and grieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first task is to stay integrated by grounding and centering yourself instead of rushing off into distractions or dissociating completely. Your second task is to create a shrine for the dead or the loss so that you can create a container for your mourning and some delineation between this world and the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the grieving is finished, move yourself and the mourner away from the shrine, and have something to eat or drink as a way to ground yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stop distracted and addictive eating, you must first recognize your emotions. When your emotions are trapped and troubled, they need to be honored and channeled, not fed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You came into this world trailing, as Robert Bly wrote in A Little Book on the Human Shadow, spontaneousities wonderfully preserved from our 150,000 years of tree life, angers well preserved from our 5,000 years of tribal life. You can save the world by allowing yourself to be happy, even slaphappy, while allowing equal time for the adult view, the depression, and the truth of the degradation all around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhilaration, the fourth healthy form of happiness, is when you become not happy and silly, but skittish, delirious, and ungrounded. It is a clear sign of a rupture between your spirit and your body and a conflict between your emotions and your logical intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhilaration is an addictive and dissociative state, and it can’t be honored or supported in safe ways until the exhilarated person is ready to come back to earth. If you’re involved with people who adhere to exhilarated fire-only practices, you may have to protect yourself from them for your own health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word stress is not an acceptable answer to any of these questions. It is a term from the world of physics and engineering, where it is defined as a pressure, pull, or force exerted on one thing by another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your flow and agility are gone, the actual stressor becomes unimportant. You can be just as stressed-out by falling in love as you can by losing your job. If you can ground and focus yourself, you’ll be able to meet these challenges in agile and resourceful ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re stressed-out, remember that you’re disconnected from your ground-ing, your flow, your agility, your sense of humor, your instincts, and your ability to set boundaries. You can connect with your emotions and ask yourself what they mean for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t control the flows of the world, but you can prepare yourself for any eventuality by nurturing flow and balance within your own psyche and by becoming a conduit through which the currents of honesty, ingenuity, vision, and emotions can flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re physically grounded and supple, your flexibility will help you meet your changing environment in resourceful ways. If you’re mentally alert and adaptable, your intelligences and focus will help you think, plan, and plot your way through any obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance is the ability to oppose, withstand, or strive against an action or a thing. In emotional resistance, you’re able to oppose, withstand, or strive against an emotion, and this can lead to change or protection against change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can embrace your resistance and turn toward your suffering, you’ll become incredibly resourceful and useful. You don’t have to erase your resistance to become enlightened, but you do have to embrace it and use it to gain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are an empath, and as an empath, you are able to engage with emotions because you have the capacity to identify and welcome them as distinct and specific entities. You have endless amounts of information at your disposal, and you can use this to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you work as an empath, you won’t become superior or invincible. You’ll simply become more able to work with your emotions, your body, your multiple intelligences, and your eagle nature than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you continue your empathic work, you may become more aware of the suffering around you and more involved in the journeys of the people in your life. This means that you are making the world around you safer for emotions and emotional awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This book is designed to help you make better decisions, invest better and get a better understanding of life through mastering basic truths, human nature and core principles from a wide range of disciplines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger’s values - lifelong learning, perseverance, intellectual curiosity, sobriety, avoidance of envy and resentment, reliability, learning from the mistakes of others, objectivity, willingness to test one’s own beliefs and many more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful investing is simply a byproduct of his carefully organized and focused approach to life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks at both internal workings as well as larger, integrated “ecosystem” in which it operates before investing - must use multiple mental models in broad fields such as history, psychology, physiology, math, engineering, biology, physics, chemistry, statistics, economics and so on. Enables Charlie to reduce the inherent chaos and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;confusion of a complex investment problem into a clarified set of fundamentals. Everything is linked and interconnected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing what to avoid more important than making great decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judge yourself by your preparation and decision making, not by the outcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We try more to profit from always remembering the obvious than from grasping the esoteric. It is remarkable how much long term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn vicariously from others mistakes as much as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don’t think about the consequences of the consequences. So important to consider these secondary and tertiary effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the incentives right is a very, very important lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a career look for 3 things - don’t sell anything you wouldn’t buy yourself, don’t work for anyone you don’t respect of admire, work only with people you enjoy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning how to “invert” problems/decisions cannot be more important. Figure out exactly what you don’t want to happen and avoid those things at all costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychology may be the most important mental model to grasp. The misery-caused mental misdirection and incentives should both be highlighted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lollapalooza effects, very big effects, tend to only come from large combinations of factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can get really good at destroying your own wrong ideas, that is a great gift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The acquisition of wisdom is a moral duty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I feel that I’m not entitled to have an opinion unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people who are in opposition.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independence is the end that wealth serves for Charlie, not the other way around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the task immediately in front of you and control spending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger a big fan of Cicero - lifelong learning, get better with old age, patience and no complaining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the job right the first time no matter how small and be responsible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger able to focus completely on the task at hand - zoning out anything else going on around him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Values durability, ritual and tradition (Brooks Brothers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In anything he does, he wants to understand and &lt;strong&gt;get to the bottom of everything&lt;/strong&gt; - whether he’s interested in it or not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out what you’re best at and keep pounding away at it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of these mental models are self taught - part of the reason he considers Ben Franklin a role model of his&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Simplicity is the end of long, hard work, not the starting point.” - Frederick Maitland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes only a handful of very large bets when he is very sure and it falls within his circle of competence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempts to understand beyond all else a company’s competitive advantage and its durability - it’s “moat”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Far more time is dedicated to reading and thinking than doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His most basic guiding principles, his fundamental philosophy of life: preparation, discipline, patience, decisiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honesty and integrity are vital and in the long run pay amazing dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I would argue passion is more important then brainpower.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I think it’s dangerous to rely on special talents - it’s better to own lots of monopolistic businesses with unregulated prices.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s [their investment approach] is not difficult, but it looks difficult because it’s unconventional.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperament is extremely important. But so too is being aggressive when it’s time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Our game is to recognize a big idea when it comes along, when one doesn’t come along very often. Opportunity comes to the prepared mind.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Beta and modern portfolio theory and the like - none of it makes any sense to me. We’re trying to buy business with sustainable competitive advantages at a low, or even a fair, price.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“…&lt;strong&gt;there are some things you should pay up for, like quality businesses and people.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to take criticism constructively and learn from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest mistakes they’ve made at Berkshire have been mistakes of omission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger advises that if you’re young, go work with very small stocks, searching for unusual mid priced opportunities but warns that it’s such a small world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t utilize the popular cost of capital - they measure every investment against the alternatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;”&lt;strong&gt;The ethos of not fooling yourself is one of the best you could possibly have. It’s powerful because it’s so rare.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Organized common (or uncommon) sense - very basic knowledge - is an enormously powerful tool…Part of [having uncommon sense] is being able to tune out folly, as opposed to recognizing wisdom. If you bat away many things, you don’t clutter yourself.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your behavior brings some unpopularity with your peer group, then the hell with them&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We should also heed the general lesson implicit in the injunction of Ben Franklin in Poor Richard’s Almanack: ‘If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives &amp;#x26; Perverse Incentives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“As usual in human affairs, what determines the behavior are incentives for the decision maker … getting the incentives right is a very, very important lesson … Appeal to interest and not to reason if you want to change conclusions … Another thing to avoid is being subjected to perverse incentives. You don’t want to be in a perverse incentive system that’s rewarding you if you behave more and more foolishly, or worse and worse. Perverse incentives are so powerful as controllers of human cognition and human behavior that one should avoid their influence.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentive-Caused Bias:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“A natural cognitive drift toward the conclusion that what is good for the professional is good for the client and the wider civilization.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt rewards much more effective than delayed rewards in changing and maintaining behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentive-caused bias - man slowly drifts into immoral behavior in order to get what he wants if the incentives are improper. Man can rationalize anything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should often distrust or at least take with a grain of salt whatever is being sold to you when the salesman has a lot to gain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavior, whether good or bad, is intensely habit-forming when it is rewarded. Make sure you reward what you want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man “games” every system he can - avoid as much as possible rewarding people for what can easily be faked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granny’s rule - first do the unpleasant and necessary tasks before rewarding yourself by proceeding to the pleasant tasks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liking/Loving Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Man will generally strive, lifelong, for the affection and approval of many people not related to him.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What will a man naturally come to like and love, apart from his parent, spouse and child? Well, he will like and love being liked and loved.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“One very practical consequence of Liking/ Loving Tendency is that it acts as a conditioning device that makes the liker or lover tend (1) to ignore faults of, and comply with wishes of, the object of his affection, (2) to favor people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of his affection (as we shall see when we get to ‘Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency,’ and (3) to distort other facts to facilitate love.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The phenomenon of liking and loving causing admiration also works in reverse. Admiration also causes or intensifies liking or love. With this ‘feedback mode’ in place, the consequences are often extreme, sometimes even causing deliberate self-destruction to help what is loved.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disliking/Hating Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In a pattern obverse to Liking/Loving Tendency, the newly arrived human is also ‘born to dislike and hate’ as triggered by normal and abnormal triggering forces in its life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Disliking/Hating Tendency also acts as a conditioning device that makes the disliker/hater tend to (1) ignore virtues in the object of dislike, (2) dislike people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of his dislike, and (3) distort other facts to facilitate hatred.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doubt-Avoidance Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency? Well, an unthreatened man, thinking of nothing in particular, is not being prompted to remove doubt through rushing to some decision. As we shall see later when we get to Social-Proof Tendency and Stress-Influence Tendency, what usually triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency is some combination of (1) puzzlement and (2) stress.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institute a “delay before decision” rule&lt;/strong&gt; into your life and you will thank yourself over and over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rare life that is wisely lived has in it many good habits maintained and many bad habits avoided or cured. And the great rule that helps here is again from Franklin’s Poor Richard’s Almanack: ‘An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.’ What Franklin is here indicating, in part, is that Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency makes it much easier to prevent a habit than to change it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Also tending to be maintained in place by the anti-change tendency of the brain are one’s previous conclusions, human loyalties, reputational identity, commitments, accepted role in a civilization, etc.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People tend to accumulate large mental holdings of fixed conclusions and attitudes that are not often reexamined or changed, even though there is plenty of good evidence that they are wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a reluctance to change, which is a form of inconsistency avoidance. Eliminating bad habits is a rare trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form good habits as early as possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also tend to be maintained in place - previous conclusions, human loyalties, reputational identity, commitments, accepted role in a civilization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider skillful counterarguments to any position you hold before making a decisions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must intensively consider any evidence tending to disconfirm any hypothesis you might have, especially one you think is particularly good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curiosity Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In advanced human civilization, culture greatly increases the effectiveness of curiosity in advancing knowledge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Curiosity, enhanced by the best of modern education (which is by definition a minority part in many places), much helps man to prevent or reduce bad consequences arising from other psychological tendencies. The curious are also provided with much fun and wisdom long after formal education has ended.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kantian Fairness Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Kant was famous for his ‘categorical imperative,’ a sort of a ‘golden rule’ that required humans to follow those behavior patterns that, if followed by all others, would make the surrounding human system work best for everybody.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerating a little unfairness should be okay if it means a greater fairness for all. The example Munger uses is letting in other drivers on the freeway knowing they will reciprocate in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Envy/Jealousy Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Envy/jealousy is extreme in myth, religion, and literature wherein, in account after account, it triggers hatred and injury.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“My guess is that people widely and generally sense that labeling some position as driven by envy/ jealousy will be regarded as extremely insulting to the position taker, possibly more so when the diagnosis is correct than when it is wrong. And if calling a position ‘envy-driven’ is perceived as the equivalent of describing its holder as a childish mental basket case, then it is quite understandable how a general taboo has arisen.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It is not greed that drives the world, but envy.” - Warren Buffett&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So much of what we do and how we react is driven by envy/jealous but it has become such a taboo that even though it is so ubiquitous, it is rarely talked about and is even left out of most psychology textbooks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reciprocation Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The automatic tendency of humans to reciprocate both favors and disfavors has long been noticed as extreme … The tendency clearly facilitates group cooperation for the benefit of members.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What both human and ant history suggest is (1) that nature has no general algorithm making intraspecies, turn-the-other-cheek behavior a booster of species survival, (2) that it is not clear that a country would have good prospects were it to abandon all reciprocate-disfavor tendency directed at outsiders, and (3) if turn-the-other-cheek behavior is a good idea for a country as it deals with outsiders, man’s culture is going to have to do a lot of heavy lifting because his genes won’t be of much help.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Like other psychological tendencies, and also man’s ability to turn somersaults, reciprocate-favor tendency operates to a very considerable degree at a subconscious level. This helps make the tendency a strong force that can sometimes be used by some men to mislead others, which happens all the time.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The standard antidote to one’s overactive hostility is to train oneself to defer reaction.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reciprocation is built into us that it often operates at a subconscious level, allowing others to easily mislead us if they want to
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to protect yourself as much as possible, avoid favors, especially from vendors, at all costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guilt is caused by wanting to be consistent and reciprocate but also being pulled in the opposite direction by the reward super response tendency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The most damaging miscalculations from mere association do not ordinarily come from advertisers and music providers. Some of the most important miscalculations come from what is accidentally associated with one’s past success, or one’s liking and loving, or one’s disliking and hating, which includes a natural hatred for bad news.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“People disagree about how much blindness should accompany the association called love. In Poor Richard’s Almanack Franklin counseled: ‘Keep your eyes wide open before marriage and half shut thereafter.’ Perhaps this ‘eyes-half-shut’ solution is about right, but I favor a tougher prescription: ‘See it like it is and love anyway.‘”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The proper antidote to creating Persian Messenger Syndrome and its bad effects is to develop, through exercise of will, a habit of welcoming bad news.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“A final serious clump of bad thinking caused by mere association lies in the common use of classification stereotypes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can be easily manipulated by mere association. It can be a group of people, the quality of a product, advertising, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“some of the most important miscalculations come from what is accidentally associated with one’s past success, or one’s liking and loving, or one’s disliking and hating, which includes a natural hatred for bad news.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully examine each past success, looking for accidental, non-causative factors associated with the success that might mislead you to making correlative assumptions and look for dangerous aspects of the new undertaking that were not present when past success occurred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hating and disliking cause equally many miscalculations based on mere association
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undervalue the competency and morals of people/businesses/products you dislike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must develop a habit of welcoming bad news in order to live in reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be cautious of using classification stereotypes to judge others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The reality is too painful to bear, so one distorts the facts until they become bearable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We all do that to some extent, often causing terrible problems. The tendency’s most extreme outcomes are usually mixed up with love, death, and chemical dependency.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In chemical dependency, wherein morals usually break down horribly, addicted persons tend to believe that they remain in respectable condition, with respectable prospects. They thus display an extremely unrealistic denial of reality as they go deeper and deeper into deterioration.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessive Self-Regard Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We all commonly observe the excessive self-regard of man. He mostly misappraises himself on the high side.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Even man’s minor possessions tend to be overappraised. Once owned, they suddenly become worth more to him than he would pay if they were offered for sale to him and he didn’t already own them. There is a name in psychology for this overappraise-your-own-possessions phenomenon: the ‘endowment effect.’ And all man’s decisions are suddenly regarded by him as better than would have been the case just before he made them.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Excessive Self-Regard Tendency diminishes the foolish bettor’s accuracy in appraising his relative degree of talent.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“There is a famous passage somewhere in Tolstoy that illuminates the power of Excessive Self-Regard Tendency. According to Tolstoy, the worst criminals don’t appraise themselves as all that bad. They come to believe either (1) that they didn’t commit their crimes or (2) that, considering the pressures and disadvantages of their lives, it is understandable and forgivable that they behaved as they did and became what they became.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The best antidote to folly from an excess of self-regard is to force yourself to be more objective when you are thinking about yourself, your family and friends, your property, and the value of your past and future activity. This isn’t easy to do well and won’t work perfectly, but it will work much better than simply letting psychological nature take its normal course.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We all think we’re above average. This is where overconfidence comes from. Also tend to over-appraise our belongings (endowment effect)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If allow people to personalize anything (choose own numbers in the lottery, make own speculative bet) they will believe much more whole-heartedly that they will win&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest type of pride should be taking pride in being trustworthy to avoid developing an ego&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to like people more who are similar to ourselves and this leads to cliques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underweight face-to-face encounters and overweight an applicant’s past record. &lt;strong&gt;The past is the strongest indicator of future results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixable but unfixed bad performance is bad character and tends to create more of itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not give excuses, simply perform and behave as you should&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Of all forms of pride, perhaps the most desirable is a justified pride in being trustworthy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overoptimism Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Man displays not only Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial but also an excess of optimism even when he is already doing well … an excess of optimism being the normal human condition, even when pain or the threat of pain is absent.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“One standard antidote to foolish optimism is trained, habitual use of the simple probability math of Fermat and Pascal, taught in my youth to high school sophomores.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deprival-Superreaction Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I include the natural human reactions to both kinds of loss experience—the loss of the possessed reward and the loss of the almost-possessed reward—under one description, Deprival-Superreaction Tendency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The quantity of man’s pleasure from a ten-dollar gain does not exactly match the quantity of his displeasure from a ten-dollar loss. That is, the loss seems to hurt much more than the gain seems to help. Moreover, if a man almost gets something he greatly wants and has it jerked away from him at the last moment, he will react much as if he had long owned the reward and had it jerked away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In displaying Deprival-Superreaction Tendency, man frequently incurs disadvantage by misframing his problems. He will often compare what is near instead of what really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man ordinarily reacts with irrational intensity to even a small loss, or threatened loss, of property, love, friendship, dominated territory, opportunity, status, or any other valued thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is almost everywhere the case that extremes of ideology are maintained with great intensity and with great antipathy to non-believers, causing extremes of cognitive dysfunction. This happens, I believe, because two psychological tendencies are usually acting concurrently toward this same sad result: (1) Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, plus (2) Deprival-Superreaction Tendency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss aversion - having something taken away hurts more than being given something feels good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applies to things we already possess and those things we nearly possess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applies to property, love, friendship, territory, opportunity, status, anything that is valued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One antidote to intense, deliberate maintenance of groupthink is an extreme culture of courtesy, kept in place despite ideological differences (Supreme Court) and the other is to deliberately bring in able and articulate disbelievers (devil’s advocates)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social-Proof Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“An automatic tendency to think and act as man sees others around him thinking and acting.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Triggering most readily occurs in the presence of puzzlement or stress, and particularly when both exist.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Because both bad and good behavior are made contagious by Social-Proof Tendency, it is highly important that human societies (1) stop any bad behavior before it spreads and (2) foster and display all good behavior.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;In social proof, it is not only action by others that misleads but also their inaction&lt;/strong&gt;. In the presence of doubt, inaction by others becomes social proof that inaction is the right course.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Social-Proof Tendency often interacts in a perverse way with Envy/Jealousy and Deprival-Superreaction Tendency.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the most important skills you can foster is learning to ignore the examples of others when they are wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Another advantage of scale comes from psychology. The psychologists use the term ‘social proof.’ We are all influenced—subconsciously and, to some extent, consciously—by what we see others do and approve.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrast-Misreaction Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Because the nervous system of man does not naturally measure in absolute scientific units, it must instead rely on something simpler. The eyes have a solution that limits their programming needs: the contrast in what is seen is registered. And as in sight, so does it go, largely, in the other senses. Moreover, as perception goes, so goes cognition. What we see tends to be what we believe. The result is man’s Contrast-Misreaction Tendency.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Contrast-Misreaction Tendency is routinely used to cause disadvantage for customers buying merchandise and services. To make an ordinary price seem low, the vendor will very frequently create a highly artificial price that is much higher than the price always sought, then advertise his standard price as a big reduction from his phony price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when something crappy is compared to something even crappier, it seems less crappy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“When a man’s steps are consecutively taken toward disaster, with each step being very small, the brain’s Contrast-Misreaction Tendency will often let the man go too far toward disaster to be able to avoid it. This happens because each step presents so small a contrast from his present position.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress-Influence Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Everyone recognizes that sudden stress, for instance from a threat, will cause a rush of adrenaline in the human body, prompting faster and more extreme reaction. And everyone who has taken Psych 101 knows that stress makes Social-Proof Tendency more powerful.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In a phenomenon less well recognized but still widely known, light stress can slightly improve performance—say, in examinations—whereas heavy stress causes dysfunction.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“But few people know more about really heavy stress than that it can cause depression. For instance, most people know that an ‘acute stress depression’ makes thinking dysfunctional because it causes an extreme of pessimism, often extended in length and usually accompanied by activity-stopping fatigue.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pavlov found that he could classify dogs to predict how easily they would breakdown, the dogs hardest to break were also the hardest to return to pre-breakdown state, any dog could be broken and he couldn’t reverse a breakdown without reimposing stress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability-Misweighing Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Man’s imperfect, limited-capacity brain easily drifts into working with what’s easily available to it. And the brain can’t use what it can’t remember or what it is blocked from recognizing because it is heavily influenced by one or more psychological tendencies bearing strongly on it. And so the mind overweighs what is easily available and thus displays Availability-Misweighing Tendency.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“One consequence of this tendency is that extra-vivid evidence, being so memorable and thus more available in cognition, should often consciously be underweighed while less vivid evidence should be overweighed.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The great algorithm to remember in dealing with this tendency is simple: &lt;strong&gt;An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checklists or a set of rules can help with this tendency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace disconfirming evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surround yourself with people who are skeptical and who oppose your views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“All skills attenuate with disuse.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Throughout his life, a wise man engages in practice of all his useful, rarely used skills, many of them outside his discipline, as a sort of duty to his better self. If he reduces the number of skills he practices and, therefore, the number of skills he retains, he will naturally drift into error from man with a hammer tendency.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The hard rule of Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency tempers its harshness for the diligent. If a skill is raised to fluency, instead of merely being crammed in briefly to enable one to pass some test, then the skill (1) will be lost more slowly and (2) will come back faster when refreshed with new learning. These are not minor advantages, and a wise man engaged in learning some important skill will not stop until he is really fluent in it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistently practice skills that you can’t afford to lose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create checklists to routinely use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you truly understand the skill, instead of just cramming it in, you will lose it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more slowly and it will come back quicker when refreshed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug-Misinfluence Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“This tendency’s destructive power is so widely known to be intense, with frequent tragic consequences for cognition and the outcome of life, that it needs no discussion here to supplement that previously given under Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid drugs at all costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“With advanced age, there comes a natural cognitive decay, differing among individuals in the earliness of its arrival and the speed of its progression.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Practically no one is good at learning complex new skills when very old. But some people remain pretty good in maintaining intensely practiced old skills until late in life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Continuous thinking and learning, done with joy, can somewhat help delay what is inevitable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authority-Misinfluence Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Living in dominance hierarchies as he does, like all his ancestors before him, man was born mostly to follow leaders, with only a few people doing the leading. And so, human society is formally organized into dominance hierarchies, with their culture augmenting the natural follow-the-leader tendency of man.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“But automatic as most human reactions are, with the tendency to follow leaders being no exception, man is often destined to suffer greatly when the leader is wrong or when his leader’s ideas don’t get through properly in the bustle of life and are misunderstood. And so, we find much miscognition from man’s Authority-Misinfluence Tendency.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful who you put in power because they will be hard to remove and have a&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lot of influence over their followers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twaddle Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Man, as a social animal who has the gift of language, is born to prattle and to pour out twaddle that does much damage when serious work is being attempted.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Some people produce copious amounts of twaddle and others very little.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s a very important part of wise administration to keep prattling people, pouring out twaddle, far away from the serious work.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason-Respecting Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“This tendency has an obvious implication. It makes man especially prone to learn well when a would-be teacher gives correct reasons for what is taught, instead of simply laying out the desired belief ex cathedra with no reasons given. Few practices, therefore, are wiser than not only thinking through reasons before giving orders but also communicating these reasons to the recipient of the order.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Unfortunately, Reason-Respecting Tendency is so strong that even a person’s giving of meaningless or incorrect reasons will increase compliance with his orders and requests.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Few practices are wiser than not only thinking through reasons before giving orders but also communicating these reasons to the recipient of the order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must tell Who was to do What, Where, When and Why&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuously ask “Why?” of everything and everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasons, even poor/meaningless reasons, will increase compliance in others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people just want the answers, not the reasons or a better understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lollapalooza Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The tendency to get extreme consequences from confluences of psychology tendencies acting in favor of a particular outcome.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“This tendency was not in any of the psychology texts I once examined, at least in any coherent fashion, yet it dominates life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The most important thing to keep in mind is the idea that especially big forces often come out of these one hundred models. When several models combine, you get lollapalooza effects; this is when two, three, or four forces are all operating in the same direction. And, frequently, you don’t get simple addition. It’s often like a critical mass in physics where you get a nuclear explosion if you get to a certain point of mass—and you don’t get anything much worth seeing if you don’t reach the mass. Sometimes the forces just add like ordinary quantities and sometimes they combine on a breakpoint or critical-mass basis … Really big effects, lollapalooza effects, will often come only from large combinations of factors (factors which reinforce and greatly amplify each other).”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inversion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“‘Invert, always invert,’ Jacobi said. He knew that it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward … It is not enough to think problems through forward. You must also think in reverse.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circle of Competence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose. And that’s as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence … Rise quite high in life by slowly developing a circle of competence—which results partly from what they were born with and partly from what they slowly develop through work … In effect, you’ve got to know what you know and what you don’t know. What could possibly be more useful in life than that?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compound Interest:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Understanding both the power of compound interest and the difficulty of getting it is the heart and soul of understanding a lot of things.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunity Cost:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Opportunity cost is a superpower, to be used by all people who have any hope of getting the right answer.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive Destruction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“When technology moves as fast as it does in a civilization like ours, you get a phenomenon that I call competitive destruction. You know, you have the finest buggy whip factory, and, all of a sudden, in comes this little horseless carriage.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surfing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“When these new businesses come in, there are huge advantages for the early birds. And when you’re an early bird, there’s a model that I call ‘surfing’—when a surfer gets up and catches the wave and just stays there, he can go a long, long time.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of Scale:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The very nature of things is that if you get a whole lot of volume through your operation, you get better at processing that volume. That’s an enormous advantage … Being so well known has advantages of scale—what you might call an informational advantage … Occasionally, scaling down and intensifying gives you the big advantage. Bigger is not always better … The great defect of scale, of course, which makes the game interesting—so that the big people don’t always win—is that as you get big, you get the bureaucracy. And with the bureaucracy comes the territoriality—which is again grounded in human nature.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man-with-a-Hammer Tendency:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“To a man with only a hammer, every problem tends to look pretty much like a nail.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five Ws:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The five Ws—you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when, and why … If you always tell people why, they’ll understand it better, they’ll consider it more important, and they’ll be more likely to comply. Even if they don’t understand your reason, they’ll be more likely to comply.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Fooling Yourself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It is, of course, irritating that extra care in thinking is not all good but also introduces extra error. But most good things have undesired ‘side effects,’ and thinking is no exception. The best defense is that of the best physicists, who systematically criticize themselves to an extreme degree, using a mindset described by Nobel laureate Richard Feynman as follows: ‘The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool.‘”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disconfirming Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Darwin paid special attention to disconfirming evidence, particularly when it disconfirmed something he believed and loved. Routines like that are required if a life is to maximize correct thinking … If you can get really good at destroying your own wrong ideas, that is a great gift.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deserve What You Want:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The safest way to try to get what you want is to try to deserve what you want. It’s such a simple idea. It’s the golden rule. You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chauffeur Knowledge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In this world I think we have two kinds of knowledge: One is Planck knowledge, that of the people who really know. They’ve paid the dues, they have the aptitude. Then we’ve got chauffeur knowledge. They have learned to prattle the talk. They may have a big head of hair. They often have fine timbre in their voices. They make a big impression. But in the end what they’ve got is chauffeur knowledge masquerading as real knowledge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfairness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Tolerating a little unfairness to some to get a greater fairness for all is a model I recommend to all of you.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second-Order Thinking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Consequences have consequences, and the consequences of the consequences have consequences, and so on.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Chemicals/Addiction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“While susceptibility varies, addiction can happen to any of us through a subtle process where the bonds of degradation are too light to be felt until they are too strong to be broken. And yet, I have yet to meet anyone, in over six decades of life, whose life was worsened by fear and avoidance of such a deceptive pathway to destruction.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Envy, Resentment, Revenge, &amp;#x26; Self-Pity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Generally speaking, envy, resentment, revenge and self-pity are disastrous modes of thought. Self-pity can get pretty close to paranoia. And paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse. You do not want to drift into self-pity … The best way to avoid envy, recognized by Aristotle, is to plainly deserve the success we get.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unreliability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Reliability is essential for progress in life and while quantum mechanics is unlearnable for a vast majority, reliability can be learned to great advantage by almost anyone.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pavlovian Association:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If people tell you what you really don’t want to hear—what’s unpleasant—there’s an almost automatic reaction of antipathy. You have to train yourself out of it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serpico Effects:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If enough people are profiting in a general social climate of doing wrong, then they’ll turn on you and become dangerous enemies if you try and blow the whistle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowd Folly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The tendency of humans, under some circumstances, to resemble lemmings, explains foolish thinking of brilliant men and much foolish behavior.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Material Needs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Most people will see declining returns (due to inflation). One of the great defenses if you’re worried about inflation is not to have a lot of silly needs in your life—you don’t need a lot of material goods.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Two-Track Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? (macro and micro-level economic factors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the subconscious influences, where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions? (influences from instincts, emotions, cravings and so on)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing and Decision Making Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all investment evaluations should begin by measuring risk, especially reputational&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate an appropriate margin of safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid dealing with people of questionable character&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insist upon proper compensation for risk assumed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always beware of inflation and interest rate exposures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid big mistakes; shun permanent capital loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independence&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always look for disconfirming evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objectivity and rationality require independence of thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that just because other people agree or disagree with you doesn’t make you right or wrong - the only thing that matters is the correctness of your analysis and judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean (merely average performance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only way to win is to work, work, work and hope to have a few insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More important than the will to win is the will to prepare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop fluency in mental models from the major academic disciplines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to get smart, the question you have to keep asking is why, why, why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual humility&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawning of wisdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay within a well-defined circle of competence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and reconcile disconfirming evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resist the craving for false precision, false certainties, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above all, never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytic rigor&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of the scientific method and effective checklists minimizes errors and omissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine value apart from price; progress apart from activity; wealth apart from size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is better to remember the obvious than to grasp the esoteric&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a business analyst, not a market, macroeconomic, or security analyst&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider totality of risk and effect; look always at potential second order and higher level impacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think forwards and backwards - invert, always invert!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proper allocation of capital is an investor’s number one job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that highest and best use is always measured by the next best use (opportunity cost)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good ideas are rare - when the odds are greatly in your favor, bet (allocate) heavily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t “fall in love” with an investment -be situation-dependent and opportunity-driven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patience&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resist the natural human bias to act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world” - Einstein; never interrupt it unnecessarily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid unnecessary transactional taxes and frictional costs; never take action for its own sake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be alert for the arrival of luck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy the process along with the proceeds, because the process is where you live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decisiveness&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when proper circumstances present themselves, act with decisiveness and conviction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity doesn’t come often, so seize it when it does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity meeting the prepared mind: that’s the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;live with change and accept unremovable complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you; don’t expect it to adapt to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually challenge and willingly amend your “best-loved” ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize reality even when you don’t like it - especially when you don’t like it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep things simple and remember what you set out to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets - and can be lost in a heartbeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guard against the effects of hubris and boredom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t overlook the obvious by drowning in minutiae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful to exclude unneeded information or slop: “A small leak can sink a great ship”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Face your big troubles; don’t sweep them under the rug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-Simple, general Problem-Solving Notions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide the big “no-brainer” questions first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply numerical fluency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invert (think through the problems in reverse)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply elementary multidisciplinary wisdom, never relying entirely upon others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch for combinations of factors - the Lollapalooza Effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Munger “inverts” as he often does&lt;/strong&gt; and instead of offering tips for a happy life, offers &lt;strong&gt;sure fire ways to be miserable, namely - ingest chemicals, envy others, resent others, be unreliable, don’t learn from others mistakes, give up after getting knocked down one, two or three times, do not look at problems backward (do not invert), do not look for evidence that disconfirms your beliefs, don’t aim to minimize objectivity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ritholtz.com/2012/02/a-lesson-on-elementary-worldly-wisdom-as-it-relates-to-investment-management-business/&quot;&gt;A Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom As It Relates To Investment Management &amp;#x26; Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can’t simply know isolated facts, they must hang together on a “latticework” of theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have multiple mental models to draw upon in order to avoid the fallacy of “everything looking like a nail to the man who has a hammer.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In investing, need the mental models of math, accounting, always communicate the why with yourself and others, engineering, biology/physiology, psychology (especially of misjudgment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He uses a two track analysis - thinks of factors that really govern the interests involved as well as the subconscious influences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microeconomics, advantages of scale are ungodly important (geometry, information advantage, social proof, specialization)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you get bigger though, you also get bureaucracy and other limiting factors, Pavlovian association (dislike those who being bad news)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The absence of change is often the friend of investors (Wrigley’s gum…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s not given to human beings to have such talent that they can just know everything about everything all the time. But it is a given to human beings who work hard at it - who&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;look and soft the world for a mispriced bet - that they can occasionally fine one. And the wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of the time they don’t. It’s just that simple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting the incentives right is a very, very important lesson.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trick is getting into better businesses since over the long term you will not make a return much different than what the underlying business earns. Recommends trying to find great businesses when they’re still small - something he might do if he were young but BRK can’t do that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management matters but if you have to bet on business momentum or the managers, bet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on momentum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great companies that can raise prices but haven’t, pricing power, are no brainers. For a while, Disney was an example of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Warren and Charlie evaluate a possible acquisition - “We’re light on financial yardsticks; we apply lots of subjective criteria. Can we trust management? Can it harm our reputation? What can go wrong? Do we understand the business? Does it require capital infusions to keep going? What is the expected cash flow? We don’t expect linear growth; cyclically is fine as long as the price is appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a career look for 3 things - don’t sell anything you wouldn’t buy yourself, don’t work for anyone you don’t respect or admire, work only with people you enjoy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope with challenges - set expectations low, have a sense of humor, learn to live with change and adapt to it and surround yourself with the love of friends and family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks again of the importance of learning and utilizing many different mental models in your decision making process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavy ideology is one of the most extreme distorters of human cognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life is one damn relatedness after another - hence, the importance of utilizing many mental models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychology may be the most important mental model to grasp. The misery-caused mental misdirection and incentives should both be highlighted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Must develop a mental model checklist&lt;/strong&gt;. Having this to rely upon will save you when others are losing their minds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s much better to let some things go uncompensated - to let life be hard - than to create systems that are easy to cheat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to change behavior you have to change motivations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We simply look for no brainers…we’ve succeeded by making the world easy for ourselves, not by solving hard problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I’m just trying to give you a method you can use to sift reality to obtain an occasional opportunity for rational reaction.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Warren and I are very good at changing our prior conclusions. We work at developing that facility because, without it, disaster often comes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I don’t want you to think we have any way of learning or behaving so you won’t make a lot of mistakes. I’m just saying that you can learn to make fewer mistakes than other people - and how to fix your mistakes faster when you do make them.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In life you’ve got to know what you know and what you don’t know. What could possibly be more useful in life than that?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you don’t have any special competence, don’t be afraid to say so&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re forced to reach a bit in your thinking, the idea gets pounded in better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What works best in most cases is to appeal to a man’s interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human mind is not constructed so that it works well without having reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there something you [Munger] are irrationally passionate about? - “yeah, I’m passionate about wisdom. I’m passionate about accuracy and some kinds of curiosity…I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have figured out. I don’t believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself. Nobody’s that smart…”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to make human systems as cheating-proof as possible even if it leaves some human misery unfixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasdaq.com/article/practical-thought-about-charlie-mungers-practical-thought-about-practical-thought-cm342375&quot;&gt;Practical Thought about practical thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first helpful notion is that it is usually best to simplify problems by deciding big “no-brainer” questions first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of numerical fluency cannot be overemphasized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invert, always invert. Many problems cannot be solved thinking forward, you just approach them by thinking backwards. What must you avoid because you don’t want it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best and most practical wisdom is elementary academic wisdom but you must think in a multidisciplinary manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lollapalooza effects, very big effects, tend to only come from large combinations of factors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to avoid envy, recognized by Aristotle, is to plainly deserve the success we get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://100investmentbooksayear.wordpress.com/2014/11/19/review-charles-mungers-the-need-for-more-multidisciplinary-skills-from-professionals-educational-implications-1998/&quot;&gt;the need for more multidisciplinary skills from prefessionals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multidisciplinary approach helps alleviate incentive caused bias (what good for professional is not necessarily good for the client) and it gives you more tools to work with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses pilot training as the gold standard for training multidisciplinary skills. It covers 6 elements - wide enough to cover practically everything useful in piloting, learned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;knowledge must reach practice based fluency, must be able to think in forward and reverse fashions, most important training gets the most time, checklist routines are mandatory, consistent and specific training to prevent atrophy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools must interweave classes so that they combine multiple disciplines in their teachings to give students a more complete education&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fundamental organizing ethos - use and rank disciplines in order of fundamentals, master to rested fluency and routinely use the truly essential parts of chemistry, math, physics and engineering, must explain things in the simplest way (may not be the discipline you are most comfortable with), if step 3 doesn’t work you must hypothesize and test to establish new principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be successful must take a simple idea and take it very seriously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are multidisciplinary skills important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are able to bring together a number of ideas and perspectives from across different subjects, and therefore may be able to offer alternative ways of looking at issues or problems. This can help identify new, innovative solutions to particular situations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I improve my multidisciplinary skills?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand who does what and why. Members of a multidisciplinary team will have different qualifications, training, and methods of working. …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn from each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respect other points of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevent power struggles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut the confusing jargon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a community within the workplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the right communication tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/06/vault-charlie-munger-institutional-funds-management/&quot;&gt;investment practices of leading charitable foundations - 1998&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An excess of professionalism may hurt you horribly precisely because the careful procedures themselves often lead to overconfidence in their outcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a law that half the population is below average yet 90% think themselves above it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biological creatures ordinarily prefer minimization in routine activities and don’t like removals of long-enjoyed benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most good things have undesired side effects and thinking is no exception. Must be extremely self critical - you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool (Feynman)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pari-mutuel analogy to stock market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - a horse (company) may clearly be a favorite but the odds (price) are such that decision in which horse to bet on (invest) is not so obvious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mungerisms.blogspot.com/2009/09/philanthropy-round-table.html&quot;&gt;breakfast meeting of philanthropy round table&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has never tried to make a single dollar, ever, from foreseeing macroeconomic changes I think that one should recognize reality even when one doesn’t like it, indeed, especially when one doesn’t like it. Also, I think one should cheerfully endure paradox that one can’t remove by good thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wealth effects have some disgusting effects on spending and aren’t taken into account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most foundations are unwise through failure to understand their own investment operations, related to a larger system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is paradoxical and disturbing to us that economists have long praised foolish spending as a necessary ingredient of a successful economy. Let us call foolish expenditures “foolexures”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Febezzlement” from excessive investment costs has significant macroeconomic effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quant Tech thought experiment - never let improper accounting start (stock options should be accounted for as expenses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The social system is fair enough that almost all massive cheating ends in disgrace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard accounting treatment for stock options is functionally equivalent to simpler types of promotional fraud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral - honesty is the best policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tilsonfunds.com/MungerUCSBspeech.pdf&quot;&gt;Academic Economics: Strengths and Faults After Considering Interdisciplinary Needs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaks about the weaknesses of economics and proposes a multidisciplinary focus instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I also was born with a huge craving for synthesis. And when it didn’t come easily, which was often, I would rag the problem, and then when I failed, I would put it aside, and I’d come back to it and rag it again.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got to know all the big ideas in all the disciplines more fundamental than your own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking opportunity costs into consideration and understanding the nature of incentives are superpowers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practically everyone overweighs the stuff that can be numbered because it yields to the statistical techniques they’re taught in academia and don’t mix in the hard to measure stuff that may be more important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use all knowledge plus extreme reductionism when possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d rather be generally right than precisely wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extreme success is likely to be caused by some combination of the following factors -extreme maximization or minimization of one or two variables (Costco and Nebraska furniture mart), adding success factors so that a bigger combination drives success and often in a nonlinear fashion, an extreme of good performance over many factors (Toyota and Les Schwab), catching and riding some big wave (oracle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You must take into consideration second and third order consequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All human systems are gamed - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Niederhoffer&quot;&gt;Niederhoffering&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Niederhoffer got to Harvard and didn’t want to work very hard for A’s. Noticed that the grad students who worked so hard always got A’s in their classes, so he only signed up for the hardest grad student classes and of course earned all A’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage&quot;&gt;Ricardo’s law of comparative advantage&lt;/a&gt; is very important - even if can do all the work more cheaply, main focus should be on why you can make cheaper/better than anybody else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The craving for perfect fairness causes a lot of terrible problems in system function. Some systems should be made deliberately unfair to individuals because they’ll be fairer on average for all of us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is not enough attention placed on virtue and vice effects - set up the system so that it is hard to cheat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a myth that once you’ve got some capital market, economic considerations demand that it has to be fast and efficient as a casino. It doesn’t. After the south sea bubble, England didn’t have publicly traded stocks and the economy did just fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you can get really good at destroying your own wrong ideas, that is a great gift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust is absolutely essential. “Ethical practices aren’t good because they pay; they pay because they’re good.” - Elbert Gary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohtvZ2qkdNA&quot;&gt;USC Gould School of law commencement Address - 2007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The safest way to get what you want is to try to deserve what you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is huge pleasure in life to be obtained from getting deserved trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s no love so right as admiration based love and such love should include the instructive dead (stand on the shoulders of giants)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The acquisition of wisdom is a moral duty. It’s not something you do just to advance in life. You must be hooked on lifetime learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I feel that I’m not entitled to have an opinion unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people who are in opposition.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Generally speaking, envy, resentment, revenge and self pity are disastrous modes of thought…self pity is always counterproductive. It’s the wrong way to think. And when you avoid it you get s great advantage over everybody else…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must eliminate the self serving bias and take it into account when dealing with others. Appeal to people’s interest and not their reason, even when your motives are lofty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid perverse incentives and being around people you wouldn’t want to be associated with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim to be working for people you admire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage in routines that help you maintain objectivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If at all feasible, you want to maneuver yourself into doing something in which you have an intense interest.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use each terrible blow that life deals you in a constructive fashion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your life what you want to maximize is a seamless web of deserved trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u76Zs4ADyJA&quot;&gt;The Psychology of Human Misjudgment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlie’s magnum opus on why we behave the way we do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very important to recognize patterns to determine how humans behave, both rationally and irrationally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I sought good judgment mostly by collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such outcomes.” Invert!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big problems in real life touch on many different realms - not enough to focus on just one discipline when many are interacting&lt;/strong&gt;. Must have many tools in the toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cognition is ordinarily situation dependent so that different situations often cause different conclusions, even when the same person is thinking in the same general subject area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will always be paradox - eliminate as much as possible and then manage as best as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The object is to buy a non dividend paying stock that compounds for 30 years at 15% and pay only a single tax of 35% at the end of the period. That comes out to 13.4% annual rate of return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett is the stock picker and Munger is the doubter, the skeptic, the devils advocate, against whom Buffett tests his ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the man who is in need of a new thinking tool, but hasn’t yet acquired it, is already paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We should also heed the general lesson implicit in the injunction of Ben Franklin in Poor Richard’s Almanack: ‘If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most important consequences of incentive superpower is what I call ‘incentive-caused bias.’ A man has an acculturated nature making him a pretty decent fellow, and yet, driven both consciously and subconsciously by incentives, he drifts into immoral behavior in order to get what he wants, a result he facilitates by rationalizing his bad behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As usual in human affairs, what determines the behavior are incentives for the decision maker … getting the incentives right is a very, very important lesson … Appeal to interest and not to reason if you want to change conclusions … Another thing to avoid is being subjected to perverse incentives. You don’t want to be in a perverse incentive system that’s rewarding you if you behave more and more foolishly, or worse and worse. Perverse incentives are so powerful as controllers of human cognition and human behavior that one should avoid their influence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A natural cognitive drift toward the conclusion that what is good for the professional is good for the client and the wider civilization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Man will generally strive, lifelong, for the affection and approval of many people not related to him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What will a man naturally come to like and love, apart from his parent, spouse and child? Well, he will like and love being liked and loved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One very practical consequence of Liking/ Loving Tendency is that it acts as a conditioning device that makes the liker or lover tend (1) to ignore faults of, and comply with wishes of, the object of his affection, (2) to favor people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of his affection (as we shall see when we get to ‘Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency,’ and (3) to distort other facts to facilitate love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The phenomenon of liking and loving causing admiration also works in reverse. Admiration also causes or intensifies liking or love. With this ‘feedback mode’ in place, the consequences are often extreme, sometimes even causing deliberate self-destruction to help what is loved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a pattern obverse to Liking/Loving Tendency, the newly arrived human is also ‘born to dislike and hate’ as triggered by normal and abnormal triggering forces in its life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disliking/Hating Tendency also acts as a conditioning device that makes the disliker/hater tend to (1) ignore virtues in the object of dislike, (2) dislike people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of his dislike, and (3) distort other facts to facilitate hatred.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency? Well, an unthreatened man, thinking of nothing in particular, is not being prompted to remove doubt through rushing to some decision. As we shall see later when we get to Social-Proof Tendency and Stress-Influence Tendency, what usually triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency is some combination of (1) puzzlement and (2) stress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The brain of man conserves programming space by being reluctant to change, which is a form of inconsistency avoidance. We see this in all human habits, constructive and destructive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rare life that is wisely lived has in it many good habits maintained and many bad habits avoided or cured. And the great rule that helps here is again from Franklin’s Poor Richard’s Almanack: ‘An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.’ What Franklin is here indicating, in part, is that Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency makes it much easier to prevent a habit than to change it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Also tending to be maintained in place by the anti-change tendency of the brain are one’s previous conclusions, human loyalties, reputational identity, commitments, accepted role in a civilization, etc.”
“People tend to accumulate large mental holdings of fixed conclusions and attitudes that are not often reexamined or changed, even though there is plenty of good evidence that they are wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In advanced human civilization, culture greatly increases the effectiveness of curiosity in advancing knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Curiosity, enhanced by the best of modern education (which is by definition a minority part in many places), much helps man to prevent or reduce bad consequences arising from other psychological tendencies. The curious are also provided with much fun and wisdom long after formal education has ended.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kant was famous for his ‘categorical imperative,’ a sort of a ‘golden rule’ that required humans to follow those behavior patterns that, if followed by all others, would make the surrounding human system work best for everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Envy/jealousy is extreme in myth, religion, and literature wherein, in account after account, it triggers hatred and injury.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My guess is that people widely and generally sense that labeling some position as driven by envy/ jealousy will be regarded as extremely insulting to the position taker, possibly more so when the diagnosis is correct than when it is wrong. And if calling a position ‘envy-driven’ is perceived as the equivalent of describing its holder as a childish mental basket case, then it is quite understandable how a general taboo has arisen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The automatic tendency of humans to reciprocate both favors and disfavors has long been noticed as extreme … The tendency clearly facilitates group cooperation for the benefit of members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What both human and ant history suggest is (1) that nature has no general algorithm making intraspecies, turn-the-other-cheek behavior a booster of species survival, (2) that it is not clear that a country would have good prospects were it to abandon all reciprocate-disfavor tendency directed at outsiders, and (3) if turn-the-other-cheek behavior is a good idea for a country as it deals with outsiders, man’s culture is going to have to do a lot of heavy lifting because his genes won’t be of much help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Like other psychological tendencies, and also man’s ability to turn somersaults, reciprocate-favor tendency operates to a very considerable degree at a subconscious level. This helps make the tendency a strong force that can sometimes be used by some men to mislead others, which happens all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most damaging miscalculations from mere association do not ordinarily come from advertisers and music providers. Some of the most important miscalculations come from what is accidentally associated with one’s past success, or one’s liking and loving, or one’s disliking and hating, which includes a natural hatred for bad news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People disagree about how much blindness should accompany the association called love. In Poor Richard’s Almanack Franklin counseled: ‘Keep your eyes wide open before marriage and half shut thereafter.’ Perhaps this ‘eyes-half-shut’ solution is about right, but I favor a tougher prescription: ‘See it like it is and love anyway.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proper antidote to creating Persian Messenger Syndrome and its bad effects is to develop, through exercise of will, a habit of welcoming bad news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A final serious clump of bad thinking caused by mere association lies in the common use of classification stereotypes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reality is too painful to bear, so one distorts the facts until they become bearable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all do that to some extent, often causing terrible problems. The tendency’s most extreme outcomes are usually mixed up with love, death, and chemical dependency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In chemical dependency, wherein morals usually break down horribly, addicted persons tend to believe that they remain in respectable condition, with respectable prospects. They thus display an extremely unrealistic denial of reality as they go deeper and deeper into deterioration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all commonly observe the excessive self-regard of man. He mostly misappraises himself on the high side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even man’s minor possessions tend to be overappraised. Once owned, they suddenly become worth more to him than he would pay if they were offered for sale to him and he didn’t already own them. There is a name in psychology for this overappraise-your-own-possessions phenomenon: the ‘endowment effect.’ And all man’s decisions are suddenly regarded by him as better than would have been the case just before he made them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Excessive Self-Regard Tendency diminishes the foolish bettor’s accuracy in appraising his relative degree of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a famous passage somewhere in Tolstoy that illuminates the power of Excessive Self-Regard Tendency. According to Tolstoy, the worst criminals don’t appraise themselves as all that bad. They come to believe either (1) that they didn’t commit their crimes or (2) that, considering the pressures and disadvantages of their lives, it is understandable and forgivable that they behaved as they did and became what they became.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best antidote to folly from an excess of self-regard is to force yourself to be more objective when you are thinking about yourself, your family and friends, your property, and the value of your past and future activity. This isn’t easy to do well and won’t work perfectly, but it will work much better than simply letting psychological nature take its normal course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Man displays not only Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial but also an excess of optimism even when he is already doing well … an excess of optimism being the normal human condition, even when pain or the threat of pain is absent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One standard antidote to foolish optimism is trained, habitual use of the simple probability math of Fermat and Pascal, taught in my youth to high school sophomores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I include the natural human reactions to both kinds of loss experience—the loss of the possessed reward and the loss of the almost-possessed reward—under one description, Deprival-Superreaction Tendency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The quantity of man’s pleasure from a ten-dollar gain does not exactly match the quantity of his displeasure from a ten-dollar loss. That is, the loss seems to hurt much more than the gain seems to help. Moreover, if a man almost gets something he greatly wants and has it jerked away from him at the last moment, he will react much as if he had long owned the reward and had it jerked away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In displaying Deprival-Superreaction Tendency, man frequently incurs disadvantage by misframing his problems. He will often compare what is near instead of what really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man ordinarily reacts with irrational intensity to even a small loss, or threatened loss, of property, love, friendship, dominated territory, opportunity, status, or any other valued thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is almost everywhere the case that extremes of ideology are maintained with great intensity and with great antipathy to non-believers, causing extremes of cognitive dysfunction. This happens, I believe, because two psychological tendencies are usually acting concurrently toward this same sad result: (1) Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, plus (2) Deprival-Superreaction Tendency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An automatic tendency to think and act as man sees others around him thinking and acting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Triggering most readily occurs in the presence of puzzlement or stress, and particularly when both exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because both bad and good behavior are made contagious by Social-Proof Tendency, it is highly important that human societies (1) stop any bad behavior before it spreads and (2) foster and display all good behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In social proof, it is not only action by others that misleads but also their inaction. In the presence of doubt, inaction by others becomes social proof that inaction is the right course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Social-Proof Tendency often interacts in a perverse way with Envy/Jealousy and Deprival-Superreaction Tendency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because the nervous system of man does not naturally measure in absolute scientific units, it must instead rely on something simpler. The eyes have a solution that limits their programming needs: the contrast in what is seen is registered. And as in sight, so does it go, largely, in the other senses. Moreover, as perception goes, so goes cognition. The result is man’s Contrast-Misreaction Tendency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Contrast-Misreaction Tendency is routinely used to cause disadvantage for customers buying merchandise and services. To make an ordinary price seem low, the vendor will very frequently create a highly artificial price that is much higher than the price always sought, then advertise his standard price as a big reduction from his phony price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When a man’s steps are consecutively taken toward disaster, with each step being very small, the brain’s Contrast-Misreaction Tendency will often let the man go too far toward disaster to be able to avoid it. This happens because each step presents so small a contrast from his present position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone recognizes that sudden stress, for instance from a threat, will cause a rush of adrenaline in the human body, prompting faster and more extreme reaction. And everyone who has taken Psych 101 knows that stress makes Social-Proof Tendency more powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a phenomenon less well recognized but still widely known, light stress can slightly improve performance—say, in examinations—whereas heavy stress causes dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But few people know more about really heavy stress than that it can cause depression. For instance, most people know that an ‘acute stress depression’ makes thinking dysfunctional because it causes an extreme of pessimism, often extended in length and usually accompanied by activity-stopping fatigue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Man’s imperfect, limited-capacity brain easily drifts into working with what’s easily available to it. And the brain can’t use what it can’t remember or what it is blocked from recognizing because it is heavily influenced by one or more psychological tendencies bearing strongly on it. And so the mind overweighs what is easily available and thus displays Availability-Misweighing Tendency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One consequence of this tendency is that extra-vivid evidence, being so memorable and thus more available in cognition, should often consciously be underweighed while less vivid evidence should be overweighed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The great algorithm to remember in dealing with this tendency is simple: An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All skills attenuate with disuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throughout his life, a wise man engages in practice of all his useful, rarely used skills, many of them outside his discipline, as a sort of duty to his better self. If he reduces the number of skills he practices and, therefore, the number of skills he retains, he will naturally drift into error from man with a hammer tendency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The hard rule of Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency tempers its harshness for the diligent. If a skill is raised to fluency, instead of merely being crammed in briefly to enable one to pass some test, then the skill (1) will be lost more slowly and (2) will come back faster when refreshed with new learning. These are not minor advantages, and a wise man engaged in learning some important skill will not stop until he is really fluent in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This tendency’s destructive power is so widely known to be intense, with frequent tragic consequences for cognition and the outcome of life, that it needs no discussion here to supplement that previously given under Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With advanced age, there comes a natural cognitive decay, differing among individuals in the earliness of its arrival and the speed of its progression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Practically no one is good at learning complex new skills when very old. But some people remain pretty good in maintaining intensely practiced old skills until late in life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Continuous thinking and learning, done with joy, can somewhat help delay what is inevitable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Living in dominance hierarchies as he does, like all his ancestors before him, man was born mostly to follow leaders, with only a few people doing the leading. And so, human society is formally organized into dominance hierarchies, with their culture augmenting the natural follow-the-leader tendency of man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But automatic as most human reactions are, with the tendency to follow leaders being no exception, man is often destined to suffer greatly when the leader is wrong or when his leader’s ideas don’t get through properly in the bustle of life and are misunderstood. And so, we find much miscognition from man’s Authority-Misinfluence Tendency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Man, as a social animal who has the gift of language, is born to prattle and to pour out twaddle that does much damage when serious work is being attempted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some people produce copious amounts of twaddle and others very little.”
“It’s a very important part of wise administration to keep prattling people, pouring out twaddle, far away from the serious work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is in man, particularly one in an advanced culture, a natural love of accurate cognition and a joy in its exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This tendency has an obvious implication. It makes man especially prone to learn well when a would-be teacher gives correct reasons for what is taught, instead of simply laying out the desired belief ex cathedra with no reasons given. Few practices, therefore, are wiser than not only thinking through reasons before giving orders but also communicating these reasons to the recipient of the order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, Reason-Respecting Tendency is so strong that even a person’s giving of meaningless or incorrect reasons will increase compliance with his orders and requests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tendency to get extreme consequences from confluences of psychology tendencies acting in favor of a particular outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This tendency was not in any of the psychology texts I once examined, at least in any coherent fashion, yet it dominates life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing to keep in mind is the idea that especially big forces often come out of these one hundred models. When several models combine, you get lollapalooza effects; this is when two, three, or four forces are all operating in the same direction. And, frequently, you don’t get simple addition. It’s often like a critical mass in physics where you get a nuclear explosion if you get to a certain point of mass—and you don’t get anything much worth seeing if you don’t reach the mass. Sometimes the forces just add like ordinary quantities and sometimes they combine on a breakpoint or critical-mass basis … Really big effects, lollapalooza effects, will often come only from large combinations of factors (factors which reinforce and greatly amplify each other).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘Invert, always invert,’ Jacobi said. He knew that it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward … It is not enough to think problems through forward. You must also think in reverse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose. And that’s as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence … Rise quite high in life by slowly developing a circle of competence—which results partly from what they were born with and partly from what they slowly develop through work … In effect, you’ve got to know what you know and what you don’t know. What could possibly be more useful in life than that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding both the power of compound interest and the difficulty of getting it is the heart and soul of understanding a lot of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Opportunity cost is a superpower, to be used by all people who have any hope of getting the right answer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When technology moves as fast as it does in a civilization like ours, you get a phenomenon that I call competitive destruction. You know, you have the finest buggy whip factory, and, all of a sudden, in comes this little horseless carriage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When these new businesses come in, there are huge advantages for the early birds. And when you’re an early bird, there’s a model that I call ‘surfing’—when a surfer gets up and catches the wave and just stays there, he can go a long, long time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The very nature of things is that if you get a whole lot of volume through your operation, you get better at processing that volume. That’s an enormous advantage … Being so well known has advantages of scale—what you might call an informational advantage … Occasionally, scaling down and intensifying gives you the big advantage. Bigger is not always better … The great defect of scale, of course, which makes the game interesting—so that the big people don’t always win—is that as you get big, you get the bureaucracy. And with the bureaucracy comes the territoriality—which is again grounded in human nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To a man with only a hammer, every problem tends to look pretty much like a nail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The five Ws—you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when, and why … If you always tell people why, they’ll understand it better, they’ll consider it more important, and they’ll be more likely to comply. Even if they don’t understand your reason, they’ll be more likely to comply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is, of course, irritating that extra care in thinking is not all good but also introduces extra error. But most good things have undesired ‘side effects,’ and thinking is no exception. The best defense is that of the best physicists, who systematically criticize themselves to an extreme degree, using a mindset described by Nobel laureate Richard Feynman as follows: ‘The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Darwin paid special attention to disconfirming evidence, particularly when it disconfirmed something he believed and loved. Routines like that are required if a life is to maximize correct thinking … If you can get really good at destroying your own wrong ideas, that is a great gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The safest way to try to get what you want is to try to deserve what you want. It’s such a simple idea. It’s the golden rule. You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this world I think we have two kinds of knowledge: One is Planck knowledge, that of the people who really know. They’ve paid the dues, they have the aptitude. Then we’ve got chauffeur knowledge. They have learned to prattle the talk. They may have a big head of hair. They often have fine timbre in their voices. They make a big impression. But in the end what they’ve got is chauffeur knowledge masquerading as real knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tolerating a little unfairness to some to get a greater fairness for all is a model I recommend to all of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consequences have consequences, and the consequences of the consequences have consequences, and so on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While susceptibility varies, addiction can happen to any of us through a subtle process where the bonds of degradation are too light to be felt until they are too strong to be broken. And yet, I have yet to meet anyone, in over six decades of life, whose life was worsened by fear and avoidance of such a deceptive pathway to destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Generally speaking, envy, resentment, revenge and self-pity are disastrous modes of thought. Self-pity can get pretty close to paranoia. And paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse. You do not want to drift into self-pity … The best way to avoid envy, recognized by Aristotle, is to plainly deserve the success we get.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reliability is essential for progress in life and while quantum mechanics is unlearnable for a vast majority, reliability can be learned to great advantage by almost anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Another advantage of scale comes from psychology. The psychologists use the term ‘social proof.’ We are all influenced—subconsciously and, to some extent, consciously—by what we see others do and approve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If people tell you what you really don’t want to hear—what’s unpleasant—there’s an almost automatic reaction of antipathy. You have to train yourself out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If enough people are profiting in a general social climate of doing wrong, then they’ll turn on you and become dangerous enemies if you try and blow the whistle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tendency of humans, under some circumstances, to resemble lemmings, explains foolish thinking of brilliant men and much foolish behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people will see declining returns (due to inflation). One of the great defenses if you’re worried about inflation is not to have a lot of silly needs in your life—you don’t need a lot of material goods.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have you learned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s good exercise to practice domain and functional together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by implementing the procedure first, it can be fun to practice refactor to state pattern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take this opportunity to review into domain/refactoring to patterns and Arlo commits -&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jay.bazuzi.com/why-acn/&quot;&gt;https://jay.bazuzi.com/why-acn/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;push object and function calisthenics as much as I can
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ninjaferret.co.uk/2015/06/05/Introducing-Functional-Calisthenics.html&quot;&gt;https://blog.ninjaferret.co.uk/2015/06/05/Introducing-Functional-Calisthenics.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fp-ts with state monoid is pretty crazy and pretty fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonytvo/abc-kata/pull/1&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tonytvo/abc-kata/pull/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions/thoughts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;review objects cathestic, functional cathestic and arlo commit notation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what’s arlo notion for adding only tests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F!! to add both tests and production code feels like big steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a better way to specify any in StateMonoid? feels like when both Output and State are the same … it seems like there some duplication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too many R!!, is there better way make it smaller?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what’re the languages that I want to use for most of my kata outside of java?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seems like typescript is a good one where I can leverage union types and functional libraries from the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is monoid?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A monad is a construction that, given an underlying type system, embeds a corresponding type system into it. This monadic type system preserves all significant aspects of the underlying type system while adding features particular to the monad.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looks like some Ring/Identiy theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monoids are good for reducing function arguments
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through currying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or thinking of function parameters as pre-constructor applied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marmelab.com/blog/2018/03/14/functional-programming-1-unit-of-code.html&quot;&gt;https://marmelab.com/blog/2018/03/14/functional-programming-1-unit-of-code.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seems like array.includes/indexOf doesn’t do deep equal on object, hence find is used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for some reasons, running tests from webstorm, skip certain tests even though, it not specified with skips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trycatch to return error early, but it seems like it better idea to explicit state the error type then throw Error from the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it turns out that Blocks concept are helpful in keeping the rules and code in sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as long as there one letter that can’t be built/match with anyblock, return error instead of throw new error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;state monoid seems to be keep repeating as a way to keep tracking of changing mutable state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting confuse between the finalState and Output of StateMonoid interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/derp/state-monad-in-fp-ts-5c79&quot;&gt;https://dev.to/derp/state-monad-in-fp-ts-5c79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have you learned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s good exercise to practice domain and functional together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by implementing the procedure first, it can be fun to practice refactor to state pattern&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions/thoughts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;review objects cathestic, functional cathestic and arlo commit notation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what’s arlo notion for adding only tests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F!! to add both tests and production code feels like big steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a better way to specify any in StateMonoid? feels like when both Output and State are the same … it seems like there some duplication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too many R!!, is there better way make it smaller?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what’re the languages that I want to use for most of my kata outside of java?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seems like typescript is a good one where I can leverage union types and functional libraries from the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is monoid?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A monad is a construction that, given an underlying type system, embeds a corresponding type system into it. This monadic type system preserves all significant aspects of the underlying type system while adding features particular to the monad.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looks like some Ring/Identiy theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monoids are good for reducing function arguments
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through currying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or thinking of function parameters as pre-constructor applied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opportunity cost of money&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first principle we learn from the book, which says that everything a person buys is financed – either by borrowing from a lender or using your own money – otherwise received on the funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nash further teaches us the concept of EVA (economic value added) – which proposes that you use your funds as a cost of capital. By doing this, you stop paying interest to others and start saving money for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, having in mind dividends — or how Nash defines them — a form of principal’s return can merely impact your success with IBC. The key is to understand the amount of money you would usually be paying other companies – and deliver it to yourself. That way, you ensure you’re not paying the interest to anyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Borrower &amp;#x26; Lander concept&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the estimations is that it is required to implement IBC for at least five years to generate enough cash value to begin financing purchases. It will take even longer if the purchase is more prominent (for example, a car or house).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to establish IBC from the ground level and leave it to the next generations, you should know that this is a long-term investment and a project that will require the next generations to continue where you stopped. It takes 20 to 25 years for the average individual to fully assemble their banking system that can finance everything using life insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of infinite banking concept&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to reduce your debt as you increase your savings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a college fund without sacrificing to do so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily creating an emergency fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recapturing the cost of business and professional expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recapturing the cost of the interest you currently pay to financial institutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoying financial freedom as well as a secure retirement without worrying about market fluctuations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a guaranteed tax-free death benefit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having access to tax-free withdrawals, loans and growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money growth
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s important to remember that the infinite banking concept is a capital accumulation strategy, which means that your cash value will be increasing throughout your life - even when you’re taking loans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;savings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We all need a place for our savings – in this case, there is no better safety net than a whole life insurance policy. You know you are guaranteed your life, and your beneficiaries will get the death benefit. Additionally, you know that while you are still alive, you can access your savings anytime and manage them in the way you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any transaction involves money flow, but where does that money come from? It comes from one pool of money managed mainly by banks, insurance companies, corporations, and a few individuals worldwide. The cash flows from the pool to help us meet our needs are primarily out of our control and back into the banking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of infinite banking is strategically using your whole life insurance policy from a mutual insurance company as a personal endless banking system. In other words, Infinite Banking is essentially being your banker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means you can borrow the money using your policy’s cash value as long as you own a whole life insurance policy. By this logic, as long as you pay your premiums regularly (thus ensuring you grow your cash value), you won’t need to borrow money from a bank again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infinite banking concept works on a couple of principles. Your end goal should be to build the value of your bank, which can be done by repeating the process of lending and repaying money stored in your cash value of a whole life insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Infinite banking concept has money benefits. Some include freeing yourself from banks and worrying about loan rates and possibilities. If you like to be entirely in charge of your finances, the infinite banking concept will allow you just that – to become your banker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wondered what the infinite part of infinite banking relates to – it goes back to the whole life insurance payout. As you know, a whole life insurance policyholder is guaranteed a payout on their deathbed as long as they’ve been paying the premiums regularly. That means that after the policy owner passes away, the beneficiaries will be given the payout and an opportunity to continue the infinite banking concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You “finance” everything you buy. As a result, either you pay interest or lose out on the interest you could have earned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an entity. An example of an entity would be a life insurance policy. These are always created to have value. The person who owns the policy has absolute control over how the money is lent and borrowed. The insurance company can only invest money if the policy owner does not use the money and pays interest instead. At the end of the year, the company analyses the policy’s value, and a dividend is declared, which cannot be taxed. “Dividend is then used to buy additional paid-up insurance at cost. Then the result is continuous compounding of an ever-increasing base.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Infinite Banking Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infinite banking concept consists of the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overfunding (with after-tax funds) a high cash value whole life insurance policy from a life insurance industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accumulation of Cash Value(tax-free) throughout the years you are a policyholder of your Whole Life insurance policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax-Free Loans were taken out against your whole life insurance policy’s cash value to use for your financial expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This concept allows you to borrow the money against your cash value like you would borrow from a bank. Additionally, you are also ensuring that your whole life insurance policy is earning dividends at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The primary purpose of IBC is to help you gain freedom in your finances, meaning you have complete control of your savings and are guaranteed that your money won’t decrease in value. Not to mention the tax-free benefits that come along with it. When you put everything on paper, you can understand why becoming your own banker is appealing.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he stresses that everyone is aware that they finance everything they buy; either the interest is paid to someone else, or you give up the interest you could have earned instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then explains the concept of Economic Value Added (EVA). EVA is the amount of profit left over after the cost of the company’s capital is deducted from the operating profit. Before this concept was introduced, companies were borrowing capital from banks and paying interest but treating their capital as having no value. Once this concept was understood, profitability increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a product begins with engineering, and the engineers of the life insurance companies are actuaries. They deal with the people who have been through a policy screening process, work with a theoretical lifespan and provide that information to rate makers. These people determine what the company will need to charge the client to pay the death claim. These matters are then turned over to lawyers to make contracts sold to clients. Finally, administration workers hold these matters all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make an insurance plan work, the policy owner makes payments, and the company uses that money to produce the benefits promised in the contract (e.g., by investing in real estate). However, the policy owner has total control over how the money in the policy is invested. Therefore, money can only be invested by the insurance company if the policy owner does not use the money and pays interest instead. If the owner does not do so, the company has access to an increasing pool of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the policy owners die, and the money is given to them from this pool of money. However, policies are generally made to benefit the company. “That is because the cash value is guaranteed to reach the face amount of the policy by the age of 100 of the Insured. There is an ever-decreasing “net amount at risk” for the company” (pg. 37).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the contracts are designed to do well no matter what. So once the dividend is declared, the policy can never lose value in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be periods where expected earnings are lower; businesses would turn to stockholders in this case, but this does not work for life insurance. Instead, capital is added to counteract this. For example, if accountants report that they have collected $1.10 from someone’s policy but found they only needed 80 cents to deliver the benefit, then the directors would decide what to do with the 30 cents. Most would put a portion of this into a contingency fund for unexpected risk and distribute the remaining dividend. Distributing the dividend is not a taxable event. If the client used the dividend to purchase additional paid-up insurance, it would result in an “ever-increasing tax-deferred accumulation of cash values that support an ever-increasing death benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;it seems like accessing the policy’s cash value using a collateral assignment is interesting&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understand Parkinson’s law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Northcote Parkinson was a British essayist, lecturer, and economist who shared observations about human nature limitations. Some of these observations include the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work expands to the amount of time given to finish it&lt;/strong&gt;. So, for example, if you are given an assignment due in three days, it is not surprising that it will be completed later on the third day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoyment of luxury becomes a necessity&lt;/strong&gt;. Once you have gotten used to luxury, we view it as necessary. For example, cars used to have no air-conditioning. That was fine when there were no alternatives, but few would now pick a car without this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expenses to rise based on income&lt;/strong&gt;. When we have more money, we often view more things as necessities and spend that extra money on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willie Sutton’s Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Willie Sutton Law stems from a story of an interview with the robber. In the story, a reporter asked Sutton why he robbed banks. According to the reporter, Sutton replied, “Because that’s where the money is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when trying to diagnose, do, or achieve something, you should choose the most apparent option or route to do so. Essentially, it is a reminder to focus on things that produce the best results most easily and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nash notes that one of the biggest thieves in this world is the Internal Revenue Service. He explains it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a person goes up to another person in the mall, puts a gun to their head, and tells them to give them all the money in their wallet, those witnessing the situation will view it as theft. However, if the same people gathered beforehand, and Nash explained how they would divide the contents of the wallet among them for an hour, this would be viewed more as democracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He explains how taxation can be viewed as a parasite-host relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Golden Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The premise of the Golden Rule is “those who have the Gold make the rules!”. This chapter expands on this idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people are so focused on living in the moment that the concept of creating personal capital through savings has lost much of its value. Therefore, someone else must provide the capital to live our lives, which comes at a high cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He illustrates this idea through the Japanese company Panasonic wanting to build a plant in Mexico. Mexico required that Mexican people own 51 percent of the business to make a plant there. As a result, Panasonic pulled out of the agreement. Panasonic had the “gold” in this scenario, so it made the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essentially, those with capital tend to have more control over decisions. If you have more cash, good opportunities tend to arise. However, people are still reliant on someone else to supply the capital. Similarly, there is a tendency to look for government solutions to a problem out of their control (e.g., obtaining a loan to afford college). This way of thinking is widespread and needs to be overcome for success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Arrival Syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This chapter discusses what Nash calls “The Arrival Syndrome.” He views this as one of the most limiting mindsets someone can have because we lose much of the ability to receive inspiration. It means that people do not try to do better or think differently because they already know what we need to know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To illustrate this, he uses the example of Ed Deming, a well-known business consultant. He is known as the person that taught Japanese businesses about quality. He first tried to preach his ideas to American companies but was brushed off because they believed they were already doing what Deming suggested. Therefore, he brought his ideas to Japan, which was a success. As a result, many business schools now accept and praise him and his ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use It Or Lose It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This chapter focuses on the last aspect of human nature that must be dealt with to be successful in becoming your banker. It is difficult to get out of our comfort zone; however, it is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nash views his teachings of the Infinite Banking Concept to argue that the world is round when most believe it is flat. It is a relatively simple concept to explain, but it becomes more difficult if you are part of the paradigm that thinks the world is flat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To accept a different paradigm, you must develop new habits and ways of thinking. For example, Nash finds that some get caught up in interest rates when learning about the Infinite Banking Concept. Instead, it is understanding money flow and charging interest to yourself and what you own. Doing this with minimal taxation can significantly improve your financial situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating The Entity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When actuaries begin creating an insurance plan, they look at many factors that will affect the value of the plan. This includes mortality rates, illnesses, mental health concerns, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the main things factored into the equations is the theoretical lifespan of individuals. Actuaries look at things such as mortality tables. If the rate that participants with an insurance or pension plan have died is better than what is shown on a mortality table, better dividends will be given to policyholders. This is the desired outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When creating a plan, cost calculations begin with how much it would cost to cover someone for their whole life. This is called single-premium life insurance. However, many do not choose this option. Instead, they choose term insurance. This involves renting a single premium life insurance for a particular time frame, but the death benefit is contingent on the individual dying within that time frame. This is like other forms of insurance (e.g., fire insurance), except those are more for “what-ifs.” Death is something you know will happen at some point, and it is just a matter of “when” it will happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nonetheless, Nash notes that particular life insurance policies have more value than some may notice. They have fewer qualities in common with standard insurance plans and more in common with banking. “A better name would have been “a banking system with a death benefit thrown in for good measure’” (pg. 68). The idea of the Infinite Banking Concept stems from this idea that there is a lot of nonsense in the market because things are not classified correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nash compares this to the common potato. In the late 1500s, conquistadors of Spain were in South America looking for gold. They did not find gold but instead found potatoes. However, when potatoes were brought back to Europe, they were considered poisonous due to their scientific classification. However, over time they realized the value of the potato for consumption and medicinal means. A similar misunderstanding happened with the tomato plant as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When choosing a plan to begin creating an entity with, it is best to select a close plan close to the Modified Endowment Contract (MEC) without crossing it. These are plans that are not treated as life insurance by the IRS. Therefore, these plans will be subject to taxation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this reason, it is best to choose a plan in the middle of the scale (figure on pg. 70) and add &lt;a href=&quot;https://livingwealth.com/paid-up-additions-pua-explained/&quot;&gt;Paid-Up Additions&lt;/a&gt; to it. The base policy and the Paid-Up Additions will pay dividends that can be used to buy more Paid-Up Additions insurance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;problem with current banking system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typical average young man is 29 years old and makes $28,500 per year after taxes — that is all he can spend. What does he do with the after-tax income? 20% is spent on transportation — 30% on housing — 45% on “living” (clothes, groceries, contributions to charitable causes, boat payments, casualty insurance on cars, vacations, etc.). Many of these items are financed by credit cards or bank notes. The balance is financed by paying cash for them — thus, giving up interest that could be earned otherwise. He is saving less than 5% of his after-tax income! (At the time of this writing, he is saving absolutely nothing!) It is the first time in the history of America that this has happened. This scenario has all the ingredients for an impending disaster!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The typical financing package for an automobile for this hypothetical person is $10,550 for 48 months with an interest rate of at least 8.5%, producing a monthly payment of $260.00 per month. It is a fact that 95% of the cars traded are not paid for. This means, at the end of 30 months, that 21% of every payment is interest – and this is a perpetual factor. It never seems to dawn on him that the volume of interest is the real issue, not the annual percentage rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This young man can qualify for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of about $93.000 at 7% APR with payments of $618.75 per month and closing costs of about $2,500.00. The problem is that he will move to another city – maybe across town- within five years – or even refinance the mortgage. Something happens to a mortgage within five years. During the 60 months, he has paid out $39,625, including closing costs but only $5,458 has gone to reduce the loan. This means that $34,167 has gone to interest and closing costs. Divide the amount paid out into the interest and closing costs, and 86% of every dollar paid out goes to the cost of financing! It is worse if he sells the house in less than five years. This situation is also perpetual. He thinks he is buying a house, but all he is doing is making the wheels of the banking business and the real estate business – in that order – turn. But all the “financial experts” are advising him to indulge in this activity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, add up all the interest he is paying out, and you find that 34.5% of every dollar paid out is interesting. For the average All-American male, this proportion never changes. Let’s assume that he is saving 10% of his disposable income (which he is not doing!). This would mean that we have a 3.45 to 1 ratio of interest paid out as compared to savings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything you do in the financial world is compared with what everyone else is doing. In America, most folks are doing the equivalent of flying with a 345-mile-per-hour headwind. Isn’t it obvious, if you have a 345-mile-per-hour tailwind, that the difference between you and them is 690 miles per hour? In all three examples, the airplane’s capability is the same — 100 miles per hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate this example into the financial world, and it is pretty obvious what is happening. Many financial gurus are concentrating on encouraging people to “get out of debt, ” which is a wonderful thing to do. In our airplane analogy, flying with no headwind is equivalent. But, I have yet to hear one of these folks recognize that the most profitable thing one can do is to create the perpetual “tailwind” to everything that you do financially. It seems that this thought never registers in their consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the System to Accommodate All Income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When someone receives a payment, they will often deposit it into someone else’s bank. Even if you have your bank account, the institution lends your money to others, and the interest you pay means the money will be gone forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through infinite banking, the same process will occur, except the individual will make loans to themself and pay them back to the policy. It is the same payment as a banking institution, except it happens tax-free, and the interest never leaves the account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So far, Nash has looked at using the life insurance banking system to finance cars, but it can be used to finance most things. You can use the same process to finance comprehensive and collision insurance. To self-insure, you must determine how much more you need to put into life insurance policies to assume the risk. This can be determined by getting a quote from an auto insurer. If they quote $750 annually for a $500 deductible, you will pay your life insurance $1,000 for zero deductible. This can also be applied to a house mortgage. If enough money has been accumulated to pay off the mortgage, you can borrow and pay it off while making sure you pay the policies you would have been paying the mortgage company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;equipment-financing&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#equipment-financing&quot; aria-label=&quot;equipment financing permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;equipment financing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nash explains other examples where the individual can use the life insurance system to finance equipment for his logging business. This can be done by borrowing from the cash value within the policy. In each scenario, the individual must set up a loan repayment plan that equals or exceeds what the individual would be paying to the finance company he used in the past. Doing this enables more cash flow which becomes capital and can be lent to more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also essential that the individual does not finance from too little capital. To avoid this, it would be optimal for the individual to add additional policies to finance from. It is also important to continue to capitalize on the policy for four years or longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strategy to improve the capital is to backdate the policy for six months. Pay the premium now, but ask the company to date the policy six months ago so there will be less time before you can use the policy to cut out the finance companies from the business equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next improvement would be self-insurance with comprehensive and collision damage. It is also advisable to self-insure for liability. By doing this, the individual would be making tax-free what the finance company and the casualty insurance company are making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual would also benefit better from owning the policies himself instead of putting them under the ownership of the company or corporation. The individual can purchase the trucks himself and lease them to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All interest in these scenarios has been paid by withdrawing additional dividend credits. The system can further be improved by selling the equipment down the line. In the end, the individual in this example would have over $3,500,000 available at age 66.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;capitalizing-your-system-and-implementation&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#capitalizing-your-system-and-implementation&quot; aria-label=&quot;capitalizing your system and implementation permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;capitalizing your system and implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great way to get started is to find a consultant or coach familiar with the Infinite Banking Concept. They will be there to help mentor you in the process. It is also a good idea to organize or join a club of like-minded people that meets periodically to support each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the most important thing you can do is get started as soon as possible. “The longer you wait, the more you have penalized yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cost of Acquisition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many businesses realize that it is necessary to finance a business, but they do not address the cost of acquisition of finance. Unfortunately, it is often costly to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nash looks at the example in the book “Iacocca.” Lee Iacocca shared that he would not have gotten involved in Chrysler if he had known how bad off it was. To get out of it, he had to get a government-backed loan. To get this, he had to gather the highest-paid members of the company to persuade lobbyists. Months later, they had succeeded in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they only had the government’s back guaranteed. They also had to get money from the bank and only was given one-third of the amount at a time. Then, when the next third was needed, they had to go through the same costly and time-consuming lobbying process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example shows the cost of the acquisition of finance, the cost of finance. The ones that paid for all the activity were Chrysler customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“But, I Can Get a Higher Rate of Return”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is introduced to the Infinite Banking Concept, many know they can get a higher rate of return from a different investment. However, that is not the point of becoming your banker. The focus is not on the investment yield. Instead, it is on how to finance things you buy with your banking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nash demonstrates this idea through the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor “A” invests $100,000 for one year and earns 20 percent. So the net yield would be $14,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor “B” builds cash values of $100,000 into a dividend-paying life insurance plan, then borrows from the system for eight percent and makes the same investment. The net yield would be $8,400. However, this investor would earn $8,000 from the banking system, so that the total yield would be $16,400. There will be a delay when first setting up the banking system, but it will be beneficial in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Different Look at the Monetary Value of a College Degree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, Nash looks at the value of a college degree. Growing up, he was told that getting a degree would offer more monetary value, but he suspects this may not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he looks at where the desire for everyone to get a college degree originated. He traces it back to World World II. Many students wanted to get their degrees because they feared that those returning from war would return to civilian life and ruin the economy. Therefore, getting a college degree became more of a necessity. Nonetheless, the cost of getting one has risen past the economy’s inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at a degree’s monetary value, Nash compares the cost of a degree to the importance of teaching a child to use dividend-paying whole life insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his example, he assumed that the college degree would get $20,000 per year for four years. If you put the same amount into the high-premium policy, the dividends would be used to pay the base cost for the premium after four years. If that individual retired at 70, the plan’s cash value would be around $2,457,303, and $145,000 dividend credits could be withdrawn for retirement purposes. If the individual was insured to 85, they could have withdrawn a total of $2,175,000; if they died that age, they could also get a death benefit of approximately $2,175,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nash does not believe that a college degree would produce as high of a financial result. The insured individual could further benefit by using the policies to finance cars, mortgages, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, in evaluating the financial benefits of the college degree at $80,000 vs. putting that same $80,000 into high-premium whole life insurance, I don’t believe the degree is as valuable. The probability of the college-educated person ever learning the benefits of “banking” through whole life insurance is not very good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nash notes that this does not mean he is against higher education but believes being educated on using life insurance policies to your advantage will likely provide more value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I am Uninsurable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some people, it may not be insurable given various circumstances. Nash offers an alternative an individual could do instead to get the benefits of being his banker while being uninsurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He provides the example of a 50-year-old father who cannot be insured. Yet, he has a 23-year-old daughter who is in excellent health. He puts $20,000 per year into a policy on her, $10,000, and $10,000 into a Paid-Up Additions Rider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 20 years, they decided to stop premium payments and draw out $28,500 per year in passive income from the cash values of the Paid-Up Additions. This is tax-free and equals the base cost for the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another 15 years, the father is 85, has taken out dividend additions, and wants to continue getting tax-free income. He can do this by switching to policy loans. If he dies at 85, he will receive $1,110,726, which will be given to his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is still there for the daughter to finance parts of her life. However, if she chooses not to, she would still be able to surrender the dividend additions for $150,000 for the rest of her life. If she dies at 90, this would mean she has received $3,150,000 in passive income and will give future generations a $2,378,391 death benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term Insurance x Investment is a better option&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you compare term insurance with whole life insurance, you will find many differences. Of course, one of them will be the price you would have to pay for both of these policies. And in those calculations — at first glance — it seems like the most logical option to choose the cheaper one – a.k.a. Term insurance, and just invest the money you would save for not buying a whole life insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, this sounds good. In practice, however, this doesn’t make much sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take a more in-depth analysis and compare what amount of money you would save with term and whole life insurance, you will understand how vital the time component is. And when you compare term and whole life insurance, you know that the time is “on a whole life insurance’s side,” as it is up until your death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? It means that IBC and whole life insurance are not only about life insurance but are a mechanism for you to capitalize your cash value over the years – and with a whole life insurance policy, years equal to total years in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A self-directed IRA brings a higher rate of return&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although investing through IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is still a way to save and invest your money, some crucial differences need to be stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, investing and saving money are two different things – which are often standing in each others’ way. When we talk about using a self-directed IRA, we’re talking about an investing strategy, which is not a purpose of infinite banking concept or becoming your own banker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBC exists — as mentioned before — to help you take control over your finances and build your cash value over the years. That means that becoming your own banker is a capital accumulation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the most critical question you should ask yourself right now is – how will I be using this asset? Because if you want to build your capital over the years and have more freedom over your finances – you will start implementing the infinite banking concept. On the other hand, if you plan to provide appreciation or cash flow, an investment strategy will be enough for you. But don’t expect to have a higher return rate using a self-directed IRA, as an investment strategy can never be compared to a capital accumulation strategy and the rate of return it has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing in real estate brings a higher rate of return&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people choose the infinite banking concept to gain freedom and complete control over their finances. Now, can you imagine having that kind of control while investing in real estate, knowing that inflation could change your cash value almost over the night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, becoming your own banker not only brings you higher safety, but it also gives you other advantages compared to real estate. Take taxes, for example – while with real estate come property taxes, becoming your own banker frees you from paying taxes while borrowing against your cash value from a whole life insurance policy. Now when you do the math, what brings you a higher rate of return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversified investments through a standard tax-qualified plan are a better option&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are they? A standard tax-qualified plan gives you security in a way that you know the exact percentage you will have to pay as a tax, no matter how diversified the investments are. But this comes with some limitations as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself accessing your savings before the age of 59.5, you will also find yourself paying 10% tax for doing that. That means that every time you want to use your own money, you will lose an additional 10%. Considering the uncertain factors around us and the fact that you probably will need to access your savings before the age of 59.5, this would mean that you would, from the start, agree on losing your own money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building capital in a US dollar-denominated asset can be risky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not feel comfortable with dividend-paying whole life insurance as it is a dollar-denominated asset. Although understanding your concerns, let’s just take a moment and remind ourselves that the US Dollar is the reserve currency of the world (meaning that the vast majority of international trade is denominated in dollars), so most probably – you are safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you want to have an exit strategy, that is always something you can do to increase your safety net. An additional thing that might be useful for you to know – if the comes to a devaluation of the US dollar, you can always ask a life insurance company to pay you your cash value (at a rate defined by the contract).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A policy loan is only an additional cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a policy loan is a simple procedure with no limits or requirements – what is up to you is to let your bank know how much money they should direct to one of your accounts, and you will be able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to know that you are borrowing against your cash value by doing this, which means this is not a loan as we’re used to. From the insurance company’s perspective – this is an asset they are giving you, for which they expect you to pay your interest. This is the root of your cost for a policy loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the possibilities you have do make it worth it. Besides the fact that you can take the loan any time you want and in any amount you need, you also do not have to return it. And additionally, even though you’re borrowing, your compounding cash value continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With IBC, there is no banking system interfering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this is not true. We say fortunately because, even though IBC gives you freedom and control over your finances, you can still count on your bank to check your accounts and help with administrative work, which is a relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when you compare IBC to other possibilities, it is non-negotiable that by becoming your own banker, the level of your dependence on the banking system is the lowest possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I need a lot of knowledge to become my own banker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, this is not far from the truth. The thing is – if you want to be successful in managing your finances and enjoy the freedom IBC brings with itself, you need to know how to handle your finances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That means you will need to learn about an alternative view of money, cash flow, and capital. But don’t think of this as something impossible – becoming your own banker is real and possible for everyone who cares enough to learn. There are even many experts offering their knowledge for people who want to implement the infinite banking concept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern western banks are a safer option&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This might be true in some cases. But if you tried using banks to access your capital, you most probably have found yourself in some kind of trouble and couldn’t access it in the desired way. Well, with IBC, that problem goes away – and guess what? It is a safer option when it comes to easy and secure access to the capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nash looks at the process of getting into a business where you are a consumer and a seller at the same time. An excellent example of this is a grocery store because everyone consumes groceries, and everyone around you is a potential customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you begin studying the grocery business, you find the things necessary to succeed in this field, including a good location, high-quality merchandise, attentive staff, fully stocked inventory, etc. All of this will cost a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the operation is set up, the difference between the “front door” and “back door” helps determine how you will be living. For example, if you sell a can of peas for 60 cents at the front door, and replace it at the back door for 57 cents, then you must turn the inventory 15 times to break even; this is the interest you must pay on the money borrowed to set up the grocery operations. If you turn the inventory 17 times, you make a profit; if you turn it 20 times in a year, it can help pay for early retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Nelson asks you to imagine if you were a male, married with children, and your wife bought groceries at your store, would she take groceries from the front or back? Many admit that the wife would want to go out the back door instead. However, this type of behavior is theft and can encourage more theft amongst employees and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many believe that they can do whatever they want with their business. However, the ones that pay for this theft are the customers getting their merchandise from the front door, and your business will need to sell more products to make up the deficit. The more you make, the more the IRS will take from you; this is another reason people would want to go out the back door instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a situation where the profits from the grocery sales are not subject to income taxes, one of the incentives to go out the back door is taken away. The only reason left is the human instinct to use the back door. However, you and your family (plus some others) are captive customers in this scenario. If you charge wholesale prices, you are not creating more proceeds for retirement income. Charging the retail price on the can of peas helps you buy more cans of peas to sell to other customers. If you continue to do this for an extended period, it will create a profit. This will also create more value and income when selling the business down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you sell your business many years later, you are in competition with others that have not obeyed these principles. He and his family members took goods out the back door. His record books will never look as good as yours. In fact, he will probably have gone out of business some years ago. Even if he is still around, can you guess which business will bring the better price? Yours! With the proceeds from the sale you can buy a huge annuity and have income deposited monthly directly to your bank account at retirement time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grocery stores are in the business of moving groceries to customers. When you sell something, you must replace the item to sell again. If you own the store don’t steal the peas. Banks are in the business of “renting money” to customers. When they lend money, they must get it back, with interest. If you own the bank don’t steal the money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, in evaluating just the financial benefits of the college degree at a cost of $80,000 vs. putting that same $80,000 into high-premium whole life insurance, I don’t believe the degree is as valuable. As a matter of fact, the probability of the college-educated person ever learning the benefits of “banking” through the use of whole life insurance is not very good”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you are in command of the banking function, you do not have to go through all this expensive erosion. The Infinite Banking Concept does exactly that! You can make timely decisions. There is no cost of acquisition. You are in competition with others who must go through the erosion that has been outlined”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By doing it this way he can have an interest deduction for the policy loans used to purchase the equipment (the loans are for business purpose)—he can depreciate the trucks over a reasonable time—and he has a “captive customer” to lease the equipment to that is sure to make the lease payments”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the essence of what The Infinite Banking Concept is all about recovering the interest that one normally pays to some banking institution and then lending it to others so that the policy owner makes what a banking institution does. It is like building an environment in the airplane world where you have a perpetual “tailwind” instead of a perpetual “headwind”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[T]he objective should be simply to get as much money as possible into a policy with the least amount of insurance instead of trying to put as little money in and provide the greatest amount of insurance (initially). It is the exact opposite of what one thinks about when purchasing ‘insurance’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just like EVA [Economic Value Added], to be effective, The Infinite Banking Concept must become a way of life. You must use it or lose it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[T]his is probably our hardest job—to get people to open up their minds and take an in-depth look at just exactly what is going on in the business world and correctly classify what is seen”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Succumbing to these feelings produces a huge burden on your financial future—the price must be paid. You will always be at the mercy of the ones who have the gold!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Economic problems are best solved by people freely contracting with one another and with government limited to the function of enforcing those contracts. And the best way to do so is through the magnificent idea of dividend-paying whole life insurance!… And only the people who care about others that are dear to them participate in the idea”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Creating your own banking system through the use of dividend-paying life insurance is much like co-generation. All the ingredients are already there in place. All you have to do is understand what is going on in such insurance plans and tap into the system”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Government is a parasite and lives off the productive taxpayers, the host. It is self-evident that if the parasite takes all the produce of the host, then both parties die” (pg. 52). Therefore, the government resorts to an exception to the rule (e.g., 401-K plans), but even with those, the government still controls much of what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Parkinson’s Law must be overcome daily. If you cannot do so then just go ahead and give up—you are destined to become a slave! That’s the bad news. The good news is—if you can whip Parkinson’s Law you will win by default because your peers can’t do it—and everything you do in the financial world is compared with what they are doing”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will take the average person at least 20 to 25 years to build a banking system through life insurance to accommodate all his own needs for finance—his autos, house, etc. But, once such a system is established, it can be passed on to future generations as long as they can be taught how the system works and suppress their baser instincts to “go out the back door of the grocery store”—or in a word that is more descriptive—steal”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This book is all about how to create your own banking system so that you can control 100 per cent of your needs—becoming your own banker! Give it your close attention ,and it can make a radical improvement in your financial future”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are only two sources of income—people at work and money at work”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use traditional banks, they get the total value of your money. However, if you create your own banking system, you will be deposited into your own bank and reap the full benefits. Nonetheless, this takes time, closer to 20 years for some, so it is something you must commit to. It can benefit future generations if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth will reside somewhere. It is up to you where you want it to reside. With life insurance plans, “you can do any of the other things in life that you desire”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You finance everything you buy. You either pay interest to someone else, or you give up the interest you could have earned elsewhere. There are no exceptions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your need for finance, during your lifetime, exceeds your need for life insurance protection. If you solve your need for finance through life insurance cash values, you will end up with so much life insurance; you can’t get it past the underwriters. You will have to ensure every person in which you have an insurable interest” (pg. 158).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what’s the quality of SAB corporate governance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what’s the quality of ThaiBev corporate governance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how much Thaibev pay to acquire SAB?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vir.com.vn/the-15-biggest-ma-deals-2009-2018-61598.html&quot;&gt;https://vir.com.vn/the-15-biggest-ma-deals-2009-2018-61598.html&lt;/a&gt;. On December 18, 2017, Vietnam Beverage (49 per cent of which is owned by ThaiBev) won an auction to acquire more than 343.66 million Sabeco shares, equivalent to 53.59 per cent of the company’s stake, at VND320,000 ($14.16) per share. This brought the deal value to nearly $5 billion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apparently, ThaiBev looking to spin off Beer unit finance for the SAB acquisition recently. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inside.beer/news/detail/singaporethailand-thaibev-revives-plan-for-an-ipo/&quot;&gt;https://www.inside.beer/news/detail/singaporethailand-thaibev-revives-plan-for-an-ipo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ThaiBev said in order to implement the deal, ThaiBev and BeerCo Ltd, a 100 percent ThaiBev owned subsidiary, got six loans, totaling $5 billion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;did Thaibev pay too much for the acquisition?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current price is around VND 190,000 compared to the acquire shares (VND 320,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/f3436820-1288-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a&quot;&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/f3436820-1288-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a&lt;/a&gt;, ThaiBev potentially looking to buyers for SAB (potentially bud APAC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what’s sabeco yearly dividend from 2017?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what’s the revenue break down of ThaiBev?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SAB contribute to 1/4 revenue in 2018 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inside.beer/news/detail/vietnam-thailand-thaibev-s-bet-on-sabeco-is-paying-off/&quot;&gt;https://www.inside.beer/news/detail/vietnam-thailand-thaibev-s-bet-on-sabeco-is-paying-off/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what’s the products of ThaiBev?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what’s the costs of ThaiBev?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what the types of SAB?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is it fast growers? stalwarts? turnover?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looks like it somewhere between stalwarts and turn over, so the strategies for stalwarts and turn over can be employed. &lt;a href=&quot;/one-up-on-wall-street&quot;&gt;SAB strategies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;why ThaiBev want to spin-off beer business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what’s the cost break down for SAB?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what’s the conflict between ThaiBev and Carlsbert?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 1995, ThaiBev launched Chang Beer and formed a 50-50 joint-venture with Carlsberg which was dissolved eight years later in 2003 after the two sides failed to resolve their disagreements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(need more information on this)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how was Sabeco managed before 2017?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very bad, the number is often wrong and most of the managers has been misreprented (or sometimes wrong)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;management has been trialed (Vo Huy Hoang, etc…, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2THiGLF_FY&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2THiGLF_FY&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currently, the company has no plan for ESOAP. However, they mentioned they have the plan for that, not sure when?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim is not to outperform competitors it is to offer a quantum leap in value that made the competition irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In overcrowded industries differentiating becomes harder and harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, value innovation is the cornerstone of Blue ocean strategy. With it you can pursue low cost and differentiation simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue oceans denote all the industries not in existence today. Where the rules of the game are waiting to be set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To focus on the red ocean is acceptance of key constraints of war, limited terrain and need to beat enemy to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This denies the distinctive strength of the business world; the capacity to create new market space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value innovation achieved when system of the company’s utility, price and cost activities are properly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formulation Principles:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconstruct market boundaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on big picture, not the numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach beyond existing demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the strategic sequence right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution principles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcome key organisational hurdles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build execution into strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Align the value, profit, and people propositions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It captures current state of play in the known market space, this allows you to understand where the competition is currently investing. In the forms of products, service and delivery and what the customers receiver from the existing offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value curve is a graphic depiction of a company’s performance across its industry’s factors of competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fundamentally shift the strategy canvas of an industry you need for shift strategic focus from competitors to alternatives and customers to non-customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Framework in the form of Questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliminate – Which of the factors that industry takes for granted should be eliminated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce – Which factors should be reduced well below the industries standard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raise – Which factors should be raised well above the industries standard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create – Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the companies value curve lacks focus the business model will tend to be complex and cost structure will be high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divergence
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it lacks divergence a companies strategy becomes a me-too with no reason to stand apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compelling tagline
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it lacks a compelling tagline that speaks to buyers, it is likely to internally driven or classic example of innovation for innovations sake. A good tagline must not only deliver a clear message but also an offering truth or else customers will lose trust and interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconstruct market boundaries:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more companies within an industry that share conventional wisdom the more they compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchasers, users and influencers may overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 Paths to reconstruct market boundaries:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look across alternative industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look across strategic groups within industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look across chain of buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look across complementary product or service offerings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look across functional or emotional appeal to buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look across time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the big picture not the numbers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual awakening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual exploration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual strategy fair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach beyond existing demand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of concentrating on customers, need to look at non-customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of focusing on customer differences, need to focus on powerful commonalities in what buyers value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First tier – sit on the edge of the market, they minimally purchase out of necessity but are mentally non-customers of industry. Jump in value would make them stay and purchase more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second tier – Non-customers who refuse your industries offerings. Consciously choosing against industry ( better alternatives?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third tier – Never thought of your market as an option, by understanding key commonalities across these non-customers plus existing customers companies can pull these into the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go for largest catchment possible, look across all 3 tiers, search for these commonalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st step.&lt;/strong&gt; Identify price corridor of the target mass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different form, same function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E.g. Model T ford replaced horses but had same function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different form and function, same objective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E.g. Cirque de soleil, same overall objective as entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd step&lt;/strong&gt;. Pick a level within the price corridor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upper level pricing – High degree of legal and resource protection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-level pricing – Some degree of legal and resource protection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower-level pricing – Low degree / easy to imitate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies would be wise to follow mid to lower if the following apply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High fixed costs and marginal variable costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attractiveness of blue ocean depends heavily on network externalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost structure behind blue ocean offering benefits from steep economies of scale and scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases volume brings significant cost advantages, something that makes pricing for volume more key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money was first used as a medium of exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold became the basis for sound money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;european governments devalued their currencies to fund their war efforts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold-backed money was replaced by government-backed money after the first world-war&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sound money is the basis for a functioning economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unsound money leads to recessions and debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin is unique in its scarcity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin could emerge as a new standard, though it faces challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without money, how does an economy function? By exchanging goods. We call this barter. If you have two pigs and your neighbor needs a cow, or vice versa, you could trade them for a haircut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these things don’t always align. No goods to offer your potential trading partner? Sorry – you won’t get what you want either! You’ll need money for that. It will be useful for any transaction since everyone wants it. This is called indirect exchange. However, early money wasn’t at all like what we keep in our wallets today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good’s salability across time refers to its ability to hold value into the future, allowing the holder to store wealth in it, which is the second function of money: store of value. For a good to be salable across time it has to be immune to rot, corrosion, and other types of deterioration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, with money, it was inevitable that one, or a few, goods would emerge as the main medium of exchange, because the property of being exchanged easily matters the most. A medium of exchange, as mentioned before, is not acquired for its own properties, but for its salability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monetary status is a spontaneously emergent product of human action, not a rational product of human design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rai Stones:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The owner of the stone could use it as a payment method without it having to move: all that would happen is that the owner would announce to all townsfolk that the stone’s ownership has now moved to the recipient. The whole town would recognise the ownership of the stone and the recipient could then use it to make a payment whenever he so pleased. There was effectively no way of stealing the stone because its ownership was known by everybody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stones’ salability across time was assured for centuries by the difficulty and high cost of acquiring new stones, because they didn’t exist in Yap and quarrying and shipping them from Palau was not easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The very high cost of procuring new stones to Yap meant that the existing supply of stones was always far larger than whatever new supply could be produced at a given period of time, making it prudent to accept them as a form of payment. In other words, Rai stones had a very high stock-to-flow ratio, and no matter how desirable they were, it was not easy for anyone to inflate the supply of stones by bringing in new rocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Yap Island chiefs who refused O’Keefe’s cheap Rai stones understood what most modern economists fail to grasp: a money that money is easy to produce is no money at all, and easy money does not make a society richer; on the contrary, it makes it poorer by placing all its hard-earned wealth for sale in exchange for something easy to produce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why don’t the Islanders use Rai stones today, if they worked so well? However, they did not retain their value, or their salability, over time. It wasn’t an issue at first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The supply of stones was limited and their value remained stable due to the difficulty of mining and moving them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the arrival of David O’Keefe, an Irish-American captain shipwrecked on the island in the late nineteenth century, that changed. O’Keefe began importing Rai stones in large numbers in exchange for coconuts, using modern technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, they were so commonplace that they could no longer serve as money – they had become mere stones again!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early pre-Christian civilizations made money resembling the change in your pocket using a revolutionary technology, metallurgy, the art of melting metals. As a result of this technology, highly salable coins could be made that were both small and light enough to be carried far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to coinage, gold stood out from the rest. But why? It has some unique characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, it is nearly impossible to destroy, and it cannot be synthesized using other materials. As for gold, you’ll need a shovel if you want it, because the only place to find it is underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the more gold you mine, the deeper you have to dig to find more gold, so gold supply still grows slowly and predictably even as gold-mining technologies improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these properties make for a material that’s incredibly effective as a store of value, making it salable through time. That became obvious fairly quickly. Gold coins were commissioned by King Croesus over 2,500 years ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although gold has existed for ages, the love affair between money and gold blossomed only in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. This is the era of sound money in history. Let’s provide some context before we define this term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid advancements in communication and transportation shaped these centuries. Trains and the telegraph made it easier than ever to transport goods and people from place to place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, ultraconvenient, nonphysical forms of payment like checks, paper receipts, and bills became more widespread. What can you do to convince merchants and consumers that the pieces of paper they’re using to buy and sell are worth something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world came up with the solution of issuing paper money backed by precious metals, which they stored in vaults. One of the most popular metals in Europe was gold. Among the first to introduce the gold standard was Isaac Newton, who was the Warden of the Royal Mint at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1900, over 50 other countries were following suit and adopting the same standard. With more and more nations issuing paper currency backed by gold reserves, gold became increasingly marketable – and therefore more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money now had gold backing, as gold had been freely chosen by the markets as the best store of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gold Standard:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different currencies were simply different weights of physical gold, and the exchange rate between one nation’s currency and the other  was the simple conversion between different weight units, as straightforward as converting inches to centimeters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the same way metric and imperial units are just a way to measure the underlying length, national currencies were just a way to measure economic value as represented in the universal store of value, gold. Some countries’ gold coins were fairly salable in other countries, as they were just gold. Each country’s money supply was not a metric to be determined by central planning committees stocked with Ph.D. holders, but the natural working of the market system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While gold was very hard money, the instruments used for settlements of payments between central banks, although nominally redeemable in gold, ended up in practice being easier to produce than gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These two flaws meant that the gold standard was always vulnerable to a run on gold in any country where circumstances might lead a large enough percentage of the population to demand redemption of their paper money in gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fatal flaw of the gold standard at the heart of these two problems was that settlement in physical gold is  cumbersome, expensive, and insecure, which meant it had to rely on centralising physical gold reserves in a few locations-banks and central banks-leaving them vulnerable to being taken over by governments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the number of payments and settlements conducted in physical gold became an infinitely smaller fraction of all payments, the banks and central banks holding the gold could create money unbacked by physical gold and use it for settlement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor Julius Caesar issued an eight-gram gold coin called the “aureus” in the first century CE. This coin was used throughout the Roman Empire for payment. As growth in the Empire slowed, rulers began “coin clipping,” which involved removing part of the precious metal contained in coins in order to enhance the government’s spending power. Sounds easy, doesn’t it? Perhaps, but it eventually led to inflation and economic crises that ultimately led to the downfall of the once-mighty Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gold standard, however, had one major flaw: the gold had to be stored in a few bank vaults. As a result, paper money was exchanged for gold, but it also created a highly centralized system in which governments controlled the value of paper money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always possible to increase the amount of money without correspondingly increasing the amount of gold. The salability of paper money rests entirely with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the major European powers took advantage of this opportunity in 1914. They were in need of cash to fund their war efforts. Instead of raising taxes, they simply printed new money in the manner of the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new money wasn’t backed by gold, and the banks didn’t replenish their gold vaults while new notes and bills were printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within weeks, the countries fighting the First World War had suspended paper money’s convertibility into gold. This was the end of the gold standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things happened as a result. First, this source of ready cash allowed governments to continue funding their war efforts for four more bloodied years. The second result of this money-printing spree was to seriously undermine the price of existing currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to Switzerland’s neutrality and refusal to participate in the war, the Austro-Hungarian krone fell by 68.9 percent against the Swiss franc. In postwar Europe, both of these factors played a major role in shaping the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three fundamental reasons that drive the relationship between unsound money and war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, unsound money is itself a barrier to trade between countries. because it distorts value between the countries and makes trade flows a political issue, creating animosity and enmity between governments and populations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, government having access to a printing press allows it to continue fighting until it completely destroys the value of its currency, and not just until it runs out of money. With sound money, the government’s war effort was limited by the taxes it could collect. With unsound money, it is restrained by how much money it can create before the currency is destroyed, making it able to appropriate wealth far more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, individuals dealing with sound money develop a lower time preference, allowing them to think more of cooperation rather than conflict,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the First World War came to an end in 1918, the European powers involved in the conflict were faced with the thorny task of revaluing their currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious solution was to return to the gold standard, but a fair revaluation would have meant admitting how little currencies are worth today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no way to return to the old exchange rates, either, as this would have overvalued paper currencies. Citizens would have demanded gold for their paper receipts, gold they could have sold abroad for a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governments chose to use fiat money instead of gold as a reserve currency. With the advent of fiat money, governments began to intervene in the economy in an attempt to stabilize their currencies, creating an era of unsound money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Second World War ended in 1944, the victorious nations began planning the postwar economic order. The Bretton Woods system was named after the small village in New Hampshire where they signed their agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was envisioned that all of the world’s currencies would be pegged to the US dollar at a fixed rate of exchange. In turn, the dollar would be linked to the value of gold at a fixed exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These exchange rates would be managed by the newly created International Monetary Fund – IMF. The whole system required the transfer of all gold reserves from participating countries to the United States!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bretton Woods was theoretically similar to the pre-1914 gold standard in that all currencies were ostensibly exchangeable for gold. However, this was not exactly the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fund economic expansion, the United States bent the rules and inflated its own currency compared to gold, while other nations inflated their currencies compared to the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold was completely abandoned as a standard once the pretense was dropped. It simply wasn’t possible to keep a rapidly inflating currency tied to gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to President Nixon, dollars will no longer be convertible into gold as of August 15, 1971. Now, the value of currencies will be determined by the interaction between the world’s major fiat currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we will see in the following insight, the results would be disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problems with moving from the Gold Standard:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The automatic adjustment mechanisms of the gold standard had always provided a constant measuring rod against which all economic activity was measured, but the floating currencies gave the world economy imbalances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The International Monetary Fund’s role was to perform an impossible balancing act between all the world’s governments to attempt to find some form of stability or “equilibrium” in this mess, keeping exchange rates within some arbitrary range of predetermined values while trade and capital flows were moving and altering them. But without a stable unit of account for the global economy, this was a task as hopeless as attempting to build a house with an elastic measuring tape whose own length varied every time it was used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only governments could redeem their dollars in gold from the United States, but that was to prove far more complicated than expected. Today, each ounce of gold for which foreign central banks received $35 is worth in excess of $1,200.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With its currency distributed all over the world, and central banks having to hold it as a reserve to trade with one another, the U.S. government could accrue significant seniorage from expanding the supply of dollars, and also had no reason to worry about running a balance of payment deficit. French economist Jacques Reuff coined the phrase “deficit without tears’” to describe the new economic reality that the United States inhabited, where it could purchase whatever it wanted from the world and finance it through debt monetised by inflating the currency that the entire world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This move by President Nixon completed the process begun with World War I, transforming the world economy from a global gold standard to a standard based on several government-issued currencies. For a world that was growing increasingly globalised along with advancements in transportation and telecommunications, freely fluctuating exchange rates constituted what Hoppe termed “a system of partial bartering” things from people who lived on the other side of imaginary lines in the sand now required utilizing more than one medium of exchange and reignited the age-old problem of lack of coincidence of wants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seller does not want the currency held by the buyer, and so the buyer must purchase another currency first, and incur conversion costs. As advances in transportation and telecommunications continue to increase global economic integration, the cost of these inefficiencies just keeps getting bigger. The market for foreign exchange, at $5 trillion of daily volume, exists purely as a result of this inefficiency of the absence of a single global homogeneous international currency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Return to Gold:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although gold was supposedly demonetized fully in 1971, central banks continued to hold significant gold reserves, and only disposed of them slowly, before returning to buying gold in the last decade. Even as central banks repeatedly declared the end of gold’s monetary role, their actions in maintaining their gold reserves ring truer. From a monetary competition perspective, keeping gold reserves is a perfectly rational decision. Keeping reserves in foreign governments’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy money only will cause the value of the country’s currency to devalue along with the reserve currencies, while the seniorage accrues to the issuer of the reserve currency, not the nation’s central bank,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrary to the most egregiously erroneous and central tenet of the state theory of money, it was not government that decreed gold as money; rather, it is only by holding gold that governments could get their money to be accepted at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth century was the heyday of sound money. The free market adopted gold as a store of value because of its qualities that made it such an effective store of value. As a result, a period of prosperity ensued. Let’s examine how that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first benefit of sound money is that it encourages people to save and invest – the perfect recipe for sustainable, long-term growth. How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human brain is wired for instant gratification over future gratification: we prefer the former to the latter. It is sound money that encourages us to consider the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we might reasonably expect our money’s value to rise over time, it makes sense to consider what we can do right now to maximize our income in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what investing is all about – delaying gratification today for a greater reward tomorrow. This leads to capital accumulation. The money is invested into capital goods, commodities that will be used to create other goods and revenue streams in the future. There is a greater likelihood of long-term, stable economic growth when there is more capital accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money that is unsound distorts capital accumulation. Here’s why. The government’s manipulation of the money supply, for example by manipulating interest rates, also affects prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a problem because prices provide investors with the information they need to make wise decisions without having to study every little detail about global affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysian businesswoman who decides not to expand her offices due to escalating copper wiring costs doesn’t need to know the price spike is the result of the recent earthquake in Chile. She knows by looking at the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government intervention, however, has meant that prices do not reflect market movements. The lack of information distorts capital accumulation, as investors do not have the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem with Socialism:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a socialist system, government owns and controls the means of production, making it at once the sole buyer and seller of all capital goods in the economy. That centralization stifles the functioning of an actual market, making sound decisions based on prices impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without a market for capital where independent actors can bid for capital, there can be no price for capital overall or for individual capital goods. Without prices of capital goods reflecting their relative supply and demand, there is no rational way of determining the most productive uses of capital, nor is there a rational way of determining how much to produce of each capital good. In a world in which the government owns the steel factory, as well as all the factories that will utilize steel in the production of various consumer and capital goods, there can be no price emerging for steel, or for the goods it is used to produce, and hence, no possible way of knowing which uses of steel are the most important and valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources and production:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only limited resource is human time. Each human has a limited time on earth, and that is the only scarcity we deal with as individuals. As a society, our only scarcity is in the total amount of time available to members of a society to produce different goods and services. More of any good can always be produced if human time goes toward it. The real cost of a good, then, is always its opportunity cost in terms of goods forgone to produce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limit on how much we can produce of each of those metals, however, remains the opportunity cost of their production relative to one another, and not their absolute quantity. There is no better evidence for this than the fact that the rarest metal in the crust of the earth, gold, has been mined for thousands of years and continues to be mined in increasing quantities as technology advances over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a misnomer to call raw materials resources, because humans are not passive consumers of manna from heaven. Raw materials are always the product of human labor and ingenuity and thus humans are the ultimate resource, because human time, effort, and ingenuity can always be used to produce more output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eternal dilemma humans face with their time concerns how to store the value they produce with their time through the future. While human time is finite, everything else is practically infinite, and more of it can be produced if more human time is directed at it. Whatever object humans chose as a store of value, its value would rise, and because more of the object can always be made, others would produce more of the object to acquire the value stored in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government intervention and Money:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government is immune to the concept of opportunity costs, and rarely are the negative results of government intervention in economic activity even considered, and if they are, it is only to justify even more government intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With no standard of value to allow an international price mechanism to exist, and with governments increasingly captured by statist and isolationist impulses, currency manipulation emerged as a tool of trade policy, with countries seeking to devalue their currencies in order to give their exporters an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More trade barriers were erected, and economic nationalism became the ethos of that era, with predictably disastrous consequences. The nations that had prospered together 40 years earlier, trading under one universal gold standard, now had large monetary and trade barriers between them, loud populist leaders who blamed all their failures on other nations, and a rising tide of hateful nationalism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When money was nationalized, it was placed under the command of politicians who operate over short time-horizons of a few years, trying their best to get reelected. It was only natural that such a process would lead to short-term decision making where politicians abuse the currency to fund their reelection campaigns at the expense of future generations. As H. L. Mencken put it: “Every election is an advanced auction on stolen goods.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This brings us to the current state of affairs in the global economy, where most governments attempt to devalue their currencies in order to boost their exports, and all complain about one anothers “unfair” manipulation of their currencies. Effectively, each country is impoverishing its citizens in order to boost its exporters and raise GDP numbers, and complaining when other countries do the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The economic ignorance is only matched by the mendacious hypocrisy of the politicians and economists parroting these lines. International economic summits are convened where world leaders try to negotiate each others acceptable currency devaluation, making the value of the currency an issue of geopolitical importance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keynesian fallacies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to the popularity of the most dangerous and absurd of all Keynesian fallacies, the notion that government spending on military effort would aid economic recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All spending is spending, in the naive economics of Keynesians, and so it matters not if that spending comes from individuals feeding their families or governments murdering foreigners: it all counts in aggregate demand and it all reduces unemployment! As an increasing number of people went hungry during the depression, all major governments spent generously on arming themselves, and the result was a return to the senseless destruction of three decades earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Keynesian economists, the war was what caused economic recovery, and if one looked at life merely through the lens of statistical aggregates collected by government bureaucrats, such a ridiculous notion is tenable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumption is key:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The twentieth century’s binge on conspicuous consumption cannot be understood separately from the destruction of sound money and the outbreak of Keynesian high-time-preference thinking, in vilifying savings and deifying consumption as the key to economic prosperity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reduced incentive to save is mirrored with an increased incentive to spend, and with interest rates regularly manipulated downwards and banks able to issue more credit than ever, lending stopped being restricted to investment, but has moved on to consumption. Credit cards and consumer loans allow individuals to borrow for the sake of consumption without even the pretense of performing investment in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time preferences of Money:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reduction in the purchasing power of money is similar to a form of taxation or expropriation, reducing the real value of one’s money even while the nominal value is constant. In modern economies government-issued money is inextricably linked to artificially lower interest rates, which is a desirable goal for modern economists because it promotes borrowing and investing. But the effect of this manipulation of the price of capital is to artificially reduce the interest rate that accrues to savers and investors, as well as the one paid by borrowers. The natural implication of this process is to reduce savings and increase borrowing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the margin, individuals will consume more of their income and borrow more against the future. This will not just have implications on their time preference in financial decisions; it will likely reflect on everything in their lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The move from money that holds its value or appreciates to money that loses its value is very significant in the long run: society saves less, accumulates less capital, and possibly begins to consume capital; worker productivity stays constant or declines, resulting in the stagnation of real wages, even if nominal wages can be made to increase its through the magical power of printing ever more depreciating pie of paper money. As people start spending more and saving less, ue become more present-oriented in all their decision making, resulting in  moral failings and a likelihood to engage in conflict and destructive and self-destructive behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest rates and misallocation of capital:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever a government has started on the path of inflating the money supply, there is no escaping the negative consequences. If the central bank stops the inflation, interest rates rise, and a recession follows as many of the projects that were started are exposed as unprofitable and have to be abandoned, exposing the misallocation of resources and capital that took place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the central bank were to continue its inflationary process indefinitely, it would just increase the scale of misallocations in the economy, wasting even more capital and making the inevitable recession even more painful. There is no escape from paying a hefty bill for the supposed free lunch that Keynesian cranks foisted upon us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the First World War, European governments implemented unsound-money policies that created all kinds of problems. Among them were recessions and an endless accumulation of debt. Find out why in this insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by talking about recessions. Central planning is one form of government interference in the market. But there’s a catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An economy can never be understood by a single person, agency, or department as a result of all the preferences, choices, costs, and resources that go into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of this information, you will likely make bad decisions, and this is precisely what governments do when they manipulate the money supply. Markets are distorted by their interventions, especially capital markets, creating a “boom and bust” cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When prices are artificially inflated during the upcycle, investors think they can buy more capital than they can afford. As a result, the economy goes into recession after the boom bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt is another issue. Let’s take a look at how unsound money caused the Great Depression in the 1930s to become indebted. Keynesian policies were increasingly adopted by governments during that time. Keynes’ followers, the “Keynesians,” believe recessions occur when total spending is too low in an economy. Spending increases are the best response to recessions, they argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your methods for doing that? You could lower taxes, but people usually don’t spend their extra cash. Another option would be for the government to provide the cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax increases are difficult during a recession, so governments increase the money supply instead. People then spend more money as a result of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the previous insight on time preferences? People tend to focus on the present when there is so much money flowing around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As savings become less appealing, opportunistic investments become more prevalent. People soon find themselves deep in debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is an endless crisis. Keynesianism makes things worse when the government intervenes. However, there is an alternative. A return to sound money would be beneficial. The new technology of Bitcoin might just make it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit Creation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit creation by central banks causes unsustainable booms by allowing the financing of unprofitable projects and allowing them to continue consuming resources on unproductive activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a sound monetary system, any business that survives does so by offering value to society, by receiving a higher revenue for its products than the costs it incurs for its inputs. The business is productive because it transforms inputs of a certain market price into outputs with a higher market price. Any firm that produces outputs valued at less than its inputs would go out of business, its resources freed up to be used by other, more productive firms, in what economist Joseph Schumpeter termed creative destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The test of the free market is suspended as central bank direction of credit can overrule the economic reality of profit and loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-scarcity-of-bitcoin-makes-it-unique&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-scarcity-of-bitcoin-makes-it-unique&quot; aria-label=&quot;the scarcity of bitcoin makes it unique permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The scarcity of Bitcoin makes it unique&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After decades of reckless spending and debt accumulation, it’s time for governments to return to sound-money policies. That’s where Bitcoin comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly can the world’s first digital currency help put economies back on track, stabilize and grow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the gold standard. Gold is a top choice for storing value for two reasons: it’s scarce and predictable, which means the supply can’t increase enough to significantly deflate its value. Bitcoin has similar characteristics. In fact, its supply cannot increase. It is impossible to have more than 21,000,000 individual bitcoins, no matter what else happens. Once 21,000,000 bitcoins are in circulation, no more will be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating bitcoins in this way also leads to stability since the currency’s supply continues to decrease constantly. To see how that works, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bitcoin is created by mining it. Bitcoin network computers pool their processing power to solve complex algorithms to access new coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reward for solving these puzzles, the “miners” – the computers that helped solve the puzzle – receive bitcoins. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, built in a failsafe – the number of bitcoins issued is halved every four years in order to prevent online gold rushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s the cherry on top? The algorithmic problems become increasingly challenging as the number of computers working on them rises, ensuring a steady and reliable supply, much like the increasing difficulty of mining gold keeps gold supply steady and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 2140, bitcoin will continue to be minted in ever-smaller amounts, after which no more coins will be minted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoins are unique because of that. The only good that is characterized by absolute scarcity is Bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with conventional commodities like oil. It’s true that they are scarce, but by investing the necessary resources we might be able to find new sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our ever-increasing oil consumption, proven oil reserves globally are increasing! Bitcoin is a radically different concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithmically programmed supply of coins cannot be exceeded by the amount of time or resources available. The result is that bitcoin cannot be devalued by manipulating its supply, making it a perfect store of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;bitcoin-is-unique-because-of-its-security&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bitcoin-is-unique-because-of-its-security&quot; aria-label=&quot;bitcoin is unique because of its security permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bitcoin is unique because of its security&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the scarcity of the unit in which its value is stored that makes sound money. Security is also important. You’re likely to turn to an alternative if you’re not absolutely convinced that bitcoins are safe. Bitcoins are extremely secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because Bitcoin relies on a new technology called the public blockchain. What is the public blockchain? An algorithmic puzzle is cracked when a mining computer creates a block. Blocks are essentially records of recent transactions and mining activity. Adding each new block to the Bitcoin blockchain creates a chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on this chain. What’s more, all that information is available to everyone on the network. A bitcoin’s ownership can only be established once it’s registered on the blockchain, which is only possible if a majority of network users approve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Bitcoin is entirely self-contained; transaction oversight is not required by a central authority. Additionally, it makes it easier to verify transactions, which gives greater security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraudsters must invest significant processing power into creating a fraudulent block – and Nakamoto’s difficulty adjustment will make it even more difficult as bitcoin becomes more popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verifying new blocks, however, takes almost no energy. Most nodes can simply refuse a suspect block without affecting their processing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacking the odds against cheating makes it a very effective fail-safe. In the end, a user would gain very little even if they spent vast amounts of energy and managed to hack a majority of all network nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking bitcoin’s security would undermine trust in the network, leading to a drop in demand and value. Talk about severing your nose from your face!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;bitcoin-could-become-the-new-standard-despite-its-challenges&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bitcoin-could-become-the-new-standard-despite-its-challenges&quot; aria-label=&quot;bitcoin could become the new standard despite its challenges permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bitcoin could become the new standard, despite its challenges&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is both scarce and secure, but is that enough to make it anything more than a passing fad? I think the answer depends on how well it can master a few major challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider price volatility. A bitcoin was worth $0.000994 US dollars when it was first used to complete a transaction in May 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2017, it had risen to $4,200, an increase of 422,520,000 percent! That’s just the long-term volatility. Bitcoin’s value jumped from $750 to $20,000 in 2017 alone. This is a result of fluctuating demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supply of bitcoins is fixed, so the currency responds to interest only through price increases. The demand for bitcoins is wildly variable due to its newness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the currency has lost its status as an effective store of value. Will the situation improve? As the market grows, these fluctuations should even out, according to the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now come to the second challenge Bitcoin faces. To become a standard, the currency must grow; however, growth, even for Bitcoin, would ultimately depend upon an increasing reliance on large, centralized institutions. If a currency’s aim is to provide people with an exchange system without relying on government-approved third parties, such as banks, then that’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to square this circle. Bitcoin currently has a limit of 500,000 transactions per day. Although the daily cap could be increased, there is no way to avoid the fact that there will be a daily cap. Cost is another issue. With more transactions taking place, there will be more nodes required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing so, the Bitcoin ledger needs to be updated more frequently, which increases fees and processing power required to process them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking bitcoin trade off the blockchain – in other words, trading in bitcoin-backed currencies – is a pretty compelling case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new standard would be created, but it would also require the creation of centralized institutions to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Bitcoin, it may be possible to establish a modern sound-money policy. Nevertheless, one question looms over its future: can it evade the fate of the gold standard? It remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation of Bitcoin is a “purely peer-to-peer form of electronic cash” that doesn’t require trust in third parties and whose supply can’t be altered. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, achieved this goal through four key technologies: a distributed peer-to-peer network, hashing, digital signatures and proof of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Growth of Altcoins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The growth of these altcoins cannot be understood outside the context of easy government money looking for easy investment, forming large bubbles in massive malinvestments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is why virtually all altcoins have a team in charge; they began the project, marketed it, designed the marketing material, and plugged press releases into the press as if they were news items, while also having the advantage of mining a large number of coins early before anybody had heard of the coins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These teams are publicly known individuals, and no matter how hard they might try, they cannot demonstrate credibly that they bave no control over the direction of the currency, which undermines any claims other currencies might have to being a form of digital cash that cannot be edited or controlled by any third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin as a reserve currency:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Bitcoin continues to evolve in the direction of having a higher market value with higher transaction fees, it starts to look more and  more like a reserve currency than a currency for everyday trading and transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is scaling through an increase in the value of on-chain transactions, not through a rise of their number. More and more transactions are being carried out off-chain, settled on exchanges or websites that handle Bitcoin, turning Bitcoin into more of a settlement network than a direct payment network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this analysis is correct, and Bitcoin continues to grow in value and off-chain transactions while on-chain transactions do not grow as much, Bitcoin would be better understood as cash in the old meaning of the term, similar to gold cash reserves, rather than the modern term for cash as paper money for small transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin can be seen as the new emerging reserve currency for online transactions, where the online equivalent of banks will issue Bitcoin-backed tokens to users while keeping their hoard of Bitcoins in cold storage, with each individual being able to audit in real time the holdings of the intermediary, and with online verification and reputation systems able to verify that no inflation is taking place. This would allow an infinite number of transactions to be carried out online without having to pay the high transaction fees for on-chain transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the foregoing analysis, the real advantage of Bitcoin lies in it being a reliable long-term store of value, and a sovereign form of money that allows individuals to conduct permissionless transactions. Bitcoin’s main uses in the foreseeable future will follow from these competitive advantages, and not from its ability to offer ubiquitous or cheap transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification &gt; Trust:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin can thus be understood as a technology that converts electricity to truthful records through the expenditure of processing power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who expend this electricity are rewarded with the bitcoin currency, and so they have a strong incentive to maintain its integrity. As a result of attaching a strong economic incentive for honesty, Bitcoin’s ledger has been practically incorruptible for the period of its operation so far, with no example of a successful double-spend attack on a confirmed transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This integrity of the bitcoin ledger of transactions is achieved without having to rely on any single party being honest. By relying entirely on verification, Bitcoin dooms fraudulent transactions to failure and obviates the need for trust in anyone for transactions to be completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, Bitcoin is a system built entirely on cumbersome and expensive verification so it can eliminate the need for any trust or accountability between all parties: it is 100% verification and 0% trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;key benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;store of value&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Bitcoin’s immutable monetary supply makes it the best medium to store value produced from the limited human time, thus making it arguably the best store of value humanity has ever created.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how many users adopt it, no matter the price, and no matter the technological innovation, there will always only be 21 million Bitcoin. The only way to address growing demand is therefore via price appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Bitcoin serves as a monetary lifeboat for people forced to transact in monetary media constantly debased by governments.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Sovereignty&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any holder of Bitcoin can send value without asking for the permission of anyone. Through a distributed peer-to-peer network, there is no central coordinator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike gold, Bitcoin cannot be destroyed or confiscated by political or criminal interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;international &amp;#x26; online settlement&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin offers a new way of carrying out international settlement that has no reliance on intermediaries and operates outside the regular financial infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold, on the other hand, is difficult to move around the world, for risk of confiscation or theft. With Bitcoin, there is also no counterparty risk. It is separated from any individual country’s economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;global unit of account&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For now, it is likely to remain a volatile, rapidly appreciating asset. But it should it become an established prime choice for payment, should it stabilise, its technological and monetary characteristics suggest it is a serious rival to globally established fiat currencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin meets all the salability criteria of sound money. Through its divisible characteristics, it is highly salable across scales. Through its digital characteristics, it is highly salable across space. And through its monetary characteristics, it is highly salable across time. With widespread adoption, it may have the potential to become the chosen global unit of account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bitcoin’s immutable monetary supply makes it the best medium to store value produced from the limited human time, thus making it arguably the best store of value humanity has ever created.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bitcoin serves as a monetary lifeboat for people forced to transact in monetary media constantly debased by governments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civilization is not about more capital accumulation per se; rather, it is about what capital accumulation allows humans to achieve, the flourishing and freedom to seek higher meaning in life when their base needs are met and most pressing dangers averted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin can be best understood as distributed software that allows for transfer of value using a currency protected from unexpected inflation without relying on trusted third parties. In other words, Bitcoin automates the functions of a modern central bank and makes them predictable and virtually immutable by programming them into code decentralized among thousands of network members, none of whom can alter the code without the consent of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound money allows people to think about the long-term and to save and invest more for the future. Saving and investing for the long run are the key to capital accumulation and the advance of human civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger the market, the more the opportunities for specialization and exchange, but also the bigger the problem of coincidence of wants—what you want to acquire is produced by someone who doesn’t want what you have to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the key property that leads to a good being adopted freely as money on the market, and that is salability—the ease with which a good can be sold on the market whenever its holder desires, with the least loss in its price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;easy money trap: anything used as a store of value will have its supply increased, and anything whose supply can be easily increased will destroy the wealth of those who used it as a store of value.
Note: As more people store value in a form of money there is an incentive to increase the flow/supply which makes it a worse store of value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one‐time collapse in the value of a monetary medium is tragic, but at least it is over quickly and its holders can begin trading, saving, and calculating with a new one. But a slow drain of its monetary value over time will slowly transfer the wealth of its holders to those who can produce the medium at a low cost. This is a lesson worth remembering when we turn to the discussion of the soundness of government money in the later parts of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coin clipping reduced the aureus’s real value, increasing the money supply, allowing the emperor to continue imprudent overspending, but eventually resulting in inflation and economic crises, which the misguided emperors would attempt to ameliorate via further coin clipping. Ferdinand Lips summarizes this process with a lesson to modern readers: It should be of interest to modern Keynesian economists, as well as to the present generation of investors, that although the emperors of Rome frantically tried to “manage” their economies, they only succeeded in making matters worse. Price and wage controls and legal tender laws were passed, but it was like trying to hold back the tides. Rioting, corruption, lawlessness and a mindless mania for speculation and gambling engulfed the empire like a plague. With money so unreliable and debased, speculation in commodities became far more attractive than producing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fatal flaw of the gold standard at the heart of these two problems was that settlement in physical gold is cumbersome, expensive, and insecure, which meant it had to rely on centralizing physical gold reserves in a few locations—banks and central banks—leaving them vulnerable to being taken over by governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the simple suspension of gold redeemability, governments’ war efforts were no longer limited to the money that they had in their own treasuries, but extended virtually to the entire wealth of the population&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Fed’s inflationary policy ended by the end of 1928, at which point the U.S. economy was ripe for the inevitable collapse that follows from the suspension of inflationism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;state of the economy is determined by the lever of aggregate spending, and any rise in unemployment or slowdown in production had no underlying causes in the structure of production or in the distortion of markets by central planners; rather it was all a shortage of spending, and the remedy is the debauching of the currency and the increase of government spending. Saving reduces spending and because spending is all that matters, government must do all it can to deter its citizens from saving. Imports drive workers out of work, so spending increases must go on domestic goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the importance of sound money can be explained for three broad reasons: first, it protects value across time, which gives people a bigger incentive to think of their future, and lowers their time preference. The lowering of the time preference is what initiates the process of human civilization and allows for humans to cooperate, prosper, and live in peace. Second, sound money allows for trade to be based on a stable unit of measurement, facilitating ever‐larger markets, free from government control and coercion, and with free trade comes peace and prosperity. Further, a unit of account is essential for all forms of economic calculation and planning, and unsound money makes economic calculation unreliable and is the root cause of economic recessions and crises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;delay his gratification to engage in risky production over a longer period of time is that these longer processes will generate more output and superior goods. In other words, investment raises the productivity of the producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civilization is not about more capital accumulation per se; rather, it is about what capital accumulation allows humans to achieve, the flourishing and freedom to seek higher meaning in life when their base needs are met and most pressing dangers averted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;increases in the money supply effectively mean low interest rates, the incentive to save and invest is diminished while the incentive to borrow increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a free market economic system, prices are knowledge, and the signals that communicate information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scarcity is the fundamental starting point of all economics, and its most important implication is the notion that everything has an opportunity cost. In the capital market, the opportunity cost of capital is forgone consumption, and the opportunity cost of consumption is forgone capital investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a free market for money, individuals would choose the currencies they want to use, and the result would be that they would choose the currency with the reliably lowest stock‐to‐flow ratio. This currency would oscillate the least with changes in demand and supply, and it would become a globally sought medium of exchange, allowing all economic calculation to be carried out with it, becoming a common unit of measure across time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a society of sound money, there are no liquidity concerns over the failure of a bank, as all banks hold all their deposits on hand, and have investments of matched maturity. In other words, there is no distinction between illiquidity and insolvency, and there is no systemic risk that could make any bank “too big to fail.” A bank that fails is the problem of its shareholders and lenders, and nobody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security of Bitcoin lies in the asymmetry between the cost of solving the proof‐of‐work necessary to commit a transaction to the ledger and the cost of verifying its validity. It costs ever‐increasing quantities of electricity and processing power to record transactions, but the cost of verifying the validity of the transactions is close to zero and will remain at that level no matter how much Bitcoin grows. To try to commit fraudulent transactions to the Bitcoin ledger is to deliberately waste resources on solving the proof‐of‐work only to watch nodes reject it at almost no cost, thereby withholding the block reward from the miner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps one of the most remarkable achievements of the Internet that an online economy that spontaneously and voluntarily emerged around a network designed by an anonymous programmer has grown, in nine years, to hold more value than is held in the money supply of most nation‐states and national currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the fundamental driver of human progress is not raw materials, but technological solutions to problems. Technology is by its nature both a non‐excludable good (meaning that once one person invents something, all others can copy it and benefit from it) and a non‐rival good (meaning that a person benefiting from an invention does not reduce the utility that accrues to others who use it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Bitcoin coders face a strong incentive to abide by consensus rules if they are to have their code adopted. The miners have to abide by the network consensus rules to receive compensation for the resources they spend on proof‐of‐work. The network members face a strong incentive to remain on the consensus rules to ensure they can clear their transactions on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordination problem of organizing a simultaneous shift among people with adversarial interests, many of whom are strongly vested in the notion of immutability for its own sake, is likely intractable barring any pressing reason for people to move away from current implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s very common for small businesses never to grow past the point at which they generate just enough profit for the owner(s) to make a modest living.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professionals have plans, and those plans are based on high-leverage activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By far the biggest leverage point in any business is marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing is the strategy you use for getting your ideal target market to know you, like you and trust you enough to become a customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the stuff you usually associate with marketing are tactics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy is the big-picture planning you do prior to the tactics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy without tactics leads to paralysis by analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tactics without strategy leads to the “bright shiny object syndrome.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT mimic large businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct response marketing is what you should be doing as a small business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct response marketing is designed to evoke an immediate response and compel prospects to take some specific action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trackable, measurable, uses compelling copy, includes multi-step, short-term follow-up, incorporates maintenance follow-up of unconverted leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, it’s all about implementation. I’ll reiterate— &lt;strong&gt;knowing and not doing is the same as not knowing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my experience, I’ve found that entrepreneurs fail to implement for one of the following three reasons:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paralysis by analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: they keep trying to learn more or get stuck chasing the latest bright shiny object in the hope that they’ll get everything perfect the first time around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember 80% out the door is better than 100% in the drawer. Successful entrepreneurs have a bias for action, implement quickly and course correct along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inability to delegate&lt;/strong&gt;: as mentioned in Chapter 5, business is a team sport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“My business is different”&lt;/strong&gt;: pretty much any conceivable problem you have or are going to encounter has been solved by someone at some time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time is Not Money&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As entrepreneurs, we only get paid for bringing value to the market— not for time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put simply entrepreneurs work in the results economy, whereas most other people work in the time and effort economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more times we create value by getting, retaining and satisfying a customer, the more we get paid. Unfortunately, many business owners get distracted “playing business.” Playing business is when you do peripheral activities that don’t really create much value. Some examples of “playing business” include things like constantly checking email and endless, nonsense meetings that have no real point or agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of playing business, you must do business. Winning in business requires you to have a relentless focus on the activities that deliver value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Transition from Business Owner to Marketer&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, &lt;strong&gt;no one knows how good your products or services are until after the sale. Before they buy, they only know how good your marketing is. Put simply, the best marketer wins every time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing is the master skill of business. It will help you make your current business a success and, importantly, it will help make other businesses and enterprises you may be involved with in the future successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re dealing with prospects, people who may not even know you exist. In this phase you identify a target market, craft a compelling message and deliver the message through advertising media.  Goal: get your prospect to know you and respond to your message.  Once they’ve indicated interest by responding, they become a lead and enter Phase II.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must be extremely focused on one niche here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goal of ad is for prospects to say “hey, that’s for me”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dominate one niche, then move to the next. Never do all at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use PVP index to find ideal target market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be as specific as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an avatar for your target customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One ad, one objective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something in the ad isn’t helping you achieve that objective, you should get rid of it (including things like company name/logo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than try and sell directly, just get prospects to indicate interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a unique selling proposition (USP): entire goal of USP is to answer question about why someone should buy from you rather than from nearest competitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid things like “quality” and “great service”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know you’re marketing your business as a commodity when prospects start the conversation by asking you about price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two questions you must ask yourself:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should they buy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should they buy from me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The uniqueness can come from the way it’s packaged, delivered, supported or even sold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you confuse them, you lose them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create your elevator pitch:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know [problem]? Well, what we do is [solution]. In fact, [proof].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchasing is done with emotions and justified with logic after the fact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid boring, “professional” sounding copy, and use emotional, strong sales copy with compelling calls to action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People love authenticity, personality, and opinion. Even if they don’t agree with you, they’ll respect you for being real and open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take advantage of this by adding video to your website featuring you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address “elephants in the room” - things all your customers think about but no one wants to bring up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use “the enemy in common” in your copy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here’s my take on naming— if you need to explain the name, to me that’s an automatic fail. The &lt;strong&gt;title should equal content.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always choose clarity over cleverness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hire experts that specialize in whatever media you decide is right for your campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must know customer acquisition cost and lifetime value to track marketing success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A successful marketing campaign has three elements: market, message and media - you must hit all three for a successful campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try and own your own marketing resources: build an email list, a website, a blog, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email marketing tips: don’t spam, be human, use a commercial system, give them value, and automate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snail mail is a great way to complement email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try and have at least 5 different sources of new leads and customers, and try and make them paid media (reliable and forces your to focus on ROI).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this phase, you’re dealing with leads, people who know you and have indicated interest in what you offer by responding to your marketing message.  Here you’ll capture them into a database, nurture them with regular value-add information and convert them into paying customers. The goal here is to get them to buy for the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;capturing-leads&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#capturing-leads&quot; aria-label=&quot;capturing leads permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Capturing Leads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When interested leads respond to your ads, you put them in a database so you can build value for them, position yourself as an authority and create a relationship built on trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do some businesses get a constant flow of leads and prospects while others struggle to get any? The answer is the same as the answer to our personal flight dilemma— infrastructure. Some businesses have built a marketing infrastructure that constantly brings in new leads, follows them up, nurtures and converts them into raving fan customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To build a system, we need to think it through from start to end.  We need to understand how it works and what resources we’ll need to run it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want all leads and customer interactions to end up in your CRM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nurturing-leads&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#nurturing-leads&quot; aria-label=&quot;nurturing leads permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Nurturing Leads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In marketing, &lt;strong&gt;the money is in the follow-up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately after you’ve captured a lead, they should go into your system, where repeated contacts are made over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact does not mean obnoxiously trying to pester leads into buying. You build a relationship, giving them value in advance of them buying anything from you, building trust and demonstrating authority in your field of expertise in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that you have a database of high-probability prospects, &lt;strong&gt;your job is to market to them until they buy or die.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of being a pest, I advocate becoming a welcome guest&lt;/strong&gt;. Send your high-probability prospects a continuous stream of value until they’re ready to buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “shock and awe package” is one of the best ways to be mind-blowingly amazing. A shock and awe package is essentially a physical box that you mail or deliver to prospects full of unique, benefit-laden assets related to your business and industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the commonalities amongst high-growth businesses is that they focus heavily on marketing and make a lot of offers. Some of these offers end up being misses and some end up being hits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could it really be that simple? Making more compelling and more frequent offers? The short answer is, yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a marketing calendar for all your marketing activities, and assign someone responsibility.  Ideally hire or outsource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to scheduled activities, think about event-triggered activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A rule of thumb I like to use is &lt;strong&gt;if someone else can do it 80% as good as you can, then you should delegate it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sales-conversion&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#sales-conversion&quot; aria-label=&quot;sales conversion permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sales Conversion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the time you get prospects to the point of sales conversion, they should already be pre-framed, pre-motivated and pre-interested and essentially asking to buy from you. If you have to convince them or put on the hard sell, then you likely need to improve your lead nurturing process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you’ve reached a level of competence, &lt;strong&gt;the real profit comes from the way you market yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolve to stop positioning yourself as a commodity and competing solely on price. The result to your bottom line will be phenomenal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, you need to move towards the model of “educate, educate, educate.” With education, you build trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must stop selling and start educating, consulting and advising prospects about the benefits your products and services deliver compared to each and every competitor in your category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This would be a good time to share with you my definition of an entrepreneur: “someone who solves people’s problems at a profit.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottom line, don’t let them think you are in sales for one second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consultative, advisory selling is the most cost-effective, the most enduring, the most impactful and the most powerful marketing strategy a business owner could ever devise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pricing strategies:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer just a “standard” and “premium” option (priced about +50% but offering 2x+ value).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer unlimited variation of your product/service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add ultra-high-ticket item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resist urge to discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite them to try before buying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make payment easy, and if possible offer payment plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re now dealing with customers. Turn your customers into raving fans by delivering a world-class experience. Then find ways of doing more business with them and increasing lifetime value.  Create an environment where referrals continually come your way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the things that separates extraordinary businesses from ordinary ones is that they lead tribes, tribes of raving fans— not just customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here are a few of the qualities of these extraordinary businesses that become tribe leaders:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They continually focus on wowing their customers, which turns them into raving fans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They create and foster lifetime relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They make it easy and fun to deal with them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They create a sense of theater around their products and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have systems so that they can reliably and consistently deliver a great experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do anything other than stay a boring commodity - be innovative in every aspect of your business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become a major voice of value to your customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the major distinctions between successful entrepreneurs and “wantrepreneurs” is that successful entrepreneurs are predominantly content creators whereas wantrepreneurs are predominantly content consumers&lt;/strong&gt;. Even more than just content creators, successful entrepreneurs are often prolific content creators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell your audience about all the effort that goes into delivering your product or service.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact is, &lt;strong&gt;no one cares about your logo, company name or some dubious claim about being the leader in your industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want to know about what your product will do for them, and your backstory is essential to this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Products Make You Money, Systems Make You a Fortune&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most valuable business systems are those which are replicable. If your business relies on a genius or superstar talent at the center of it, then it will be difficult or impossible to replicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems allow mere mortals to run an extraordinary business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are four main types of business systems you need to create, regardless of what type of business you’re in. You’re almost guaranteed to make a fortune, if you can create scalable and replicable systems in these four areas of your business:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing system&lt;/strong&gt;: generate a consistent flow of leads into the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales system&lt;/strong&gt;: lead nurturing, follow-up and conversion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fulfillment system&lt;/strong&gt;: the actual thing you do in exchange for the customer’s money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Administration system&lt;/strong&gt;: accounts, reception, human resources and so on; support of all the other business functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you went overseas for six months, when you came back would your business be in better or worse shape than when you left it? Would you even have a business to come back to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the best tools you can use in building business systems is checklists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To recap, it’s essentially a three-step process:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify all the roles in your business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define what tasks each role performs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create checklists for properly completing these tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now scaling becomes super easy - just add people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think carefully about how you want to exit - you’ll rarely make as much money running a business as you will selling one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real profit comes from figuring out how to sell more to existing customers.  Five ways to do this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raise prices (make sure to explain why, explain benefits, or grandfather)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upsell (if they buy primary expensive product, add on smaller items)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ascension (move customers to higher tier products)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequency (increasing frequency at which they buy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some numbers you need to track:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leads&lt;/strong&gt;: calculate the number of new leads that come into your business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversion rate&lt;/strong&gt;: calculate the percentage of leads you converted into paying customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average transaction value&lt;/strong&gt;: know the average dollar amount that customers spend with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break-even point&lt;/strong&gt;: identify the dollar amount you need to make to keep your doors open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key metrics to track in subscription business:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monthly recurring revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Churn rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer lifetime value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on your “Tribe” customers:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tribe&lt;/strong&gt;: this set of customers are raving fans, supporters and cheerleaders who promote your business and are actively conspiring for your success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another way to categorize customers is using Net Promoter Score (NPS) - positive scores are good, &gt;+50 is excellent
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Net Promoter Score is calculated based on responses to a single question, “How likely is it that you would recommend our company/ product/ service to a friend or colleague?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This brings us to &lt;strong&gt;one of the best strategies for getting what you want in business and indeed in life— just ask.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for referrals from customers for whom you’ve delivered a good result, and/or make it known during the sales or on boarding process you expect them to give you referrals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be specific in your requests for referrals (who you ask and what kind of referral you want to receive).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try and find other complementary businesses that your customer deals with before they deal with you and form partnerships or lead exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving a gift card or voucher is a great way to do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Your Brand&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of your business as a person. What attributes make up its personality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s its name?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it wear? (i.e., design)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it communicate? (i.e., positioning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are its core values and what does it stand for? (i.e., brand promise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who does it associate with? (i.e., target market) Is it well-known? (i.e., brand awareness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When all is said and done, branding is something you do after someone has bought from you rather than something you do to induce them to buy from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basic issue in marketing is creating a category you can be first in. It’s the law of leadership: It’s better to be first than it is to be better. It’s much easier to get into the mind first than to try to convince someone you have a better product than the one that did get there first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not every first is going to become successful, however. Timing is an issue — your first could be too late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some firsts are just bad ideas that will never go anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The law of leadership applies to any product, any brand, any category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re introducing the first brand in a new category, you should always try to select a name that can work generically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, benchmarking doesn’t work. Regardless of reality, people perceive the first product into the mind as superior. Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you launch a new product, the first question to ask yourself is not “How is this new product better than the competition? “but “First what? “In other words, what category is this new product first in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is counter to classic marketing thinking, which is brand oriented: How do I get people to prefer my brand? Forget the brand. Think categories. Prospects are on the defensive when it comes to brands. Everyone talks about why their brand is better. But prospects have an open mind when it comes to categories. Everyone is interested in what’s new. Few people are interested in what’s better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The law of the mind follows from the law of perception. If marketing is a battle of perception, not product, then the mind takes precedence over the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a mind is made up, it rarely, if ever, changes. The single most wasteful thing you can do in marketing is try to change a mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason you blast instead of worm is that people don’t like to change their minds. Once they perceive you one way, that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s an illusion. There is no objective reality. There are no facts. There are no best products. All that exists in the world of marketing are perceptions in the minds of the customer or prospect. The perception is the reality. Everything else is an illusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What some marketing people see as the natural laws of marketing are based on a flawed premise that the product is the hero of the marketing program and that you’ll win or lose based on the merits of the product. Which is why the natural, logical way to market a product is invariably wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only by studying how perceptions are formed in the mind and focusing your marketing programs on those perceptions can you overcome your basically incorrect marketing instincts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truth is nothing more or less than one expert’s perception. And who is the expert? It’s someone who is perceived to be an expert in the mind of somebody else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing a prospect’s mind is another matter. Minds of customers or prospects are very difficult to change. With a modicum of experience in a product category, a consumer assumes that he or she is right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not products. Marketing is the process of dealing with those perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes the battle even more difficult is that customers frequently make buying decisions based on second-hand perceptions. Instead of using their own perceptions, they base their buying decisions on someone else’s perception of reality. This is the “everybody knows“ principle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing is not a battle of products. It’s a battle of perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company can become incredibly successful if it can find a way to own a word in the mind of the prospect. Not a complicated word. Not an invented one. The simple words are best, words taken right out of the dictionary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the law of focus. You “burn” your way into the mind by narrowing the focus to a single word or concept. It’s the ultimate marketing sacrifice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a way, the law of leadership — it’s better to be first than to be better — enables the first brand or company to own a word in the mind of the prospect. But the word the leader owns is so simple that it’s invisible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The leader owns the word that stands for the category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An astute leader will go one step further to solidify its position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re not a leader, then your word has to have a narrow focus. Even more important, however, your word has to be “available “in your category. No one else can have a lock on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most effective words are simple and benefit oriented. No matter how complicated the product, no matter how complicated the needs of the market, it’s always better to focus on one word or benefit rather than two or three or four.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, there’s the halo effect. If you strongly establish one benefit, the prospect is likely to give you a lot of other benefits, too. A “thicker“ spaghetti sauce implies quality, nourishing ingredients, value, and so on. A “safer“ car implies better design and engineering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Words come in different varieties. They can be benefit related (cavity prevention), service related (home delivery), audience related (younger people), or sales related (preferred brand).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although we’ve been touting that words stick in the mind, nothing lasts forever. There comes a time when a company must change words. It’s not an easy task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What won’t work in marketing is leaving your own word in search of a word owned by others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The essence of marketing is narrowing the focus. You become stronger when you reduce the scope of your operations. You can’t stand for something if you chase after everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t narrow the focus with quality or any other idea that doesn’t have proponents for the opposite point of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you develop your word to focus on, be prepared to fend off the lawyers. They want to trademark everything you publish. The trick is to get others to use your word. (To be a leader you have to have followers.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have your word, you have to go out of your way to protect it in the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a competitor owns a word or position in the prospect’s mind, it is futile to attempt to own the same word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the disaster stories, many companies continue to violate the law of exclusivity. You can’t change people’s minds once they are made up. In fact, what you often do is reinforce your competitor’s position by making its concept more important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What often leads marketers down this booby-trapped lane is that wonderful stuff called research.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While being first into the prospect’s mind ought to be your primary marketing objective, the battle isn’t lost if you fail in this endeavor. There are strategies to use for No. 2 and No. 3 brands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All products are not created equal. There’s a hierarchy in the mind that prospects use in making decisions. For each category, there is a product ladder in the mind. On each rung is a brand name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your marketing strategy should depend on how soon you got into the mind and consequently which rung of the ladder you occupy. The higher the better, of course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about your product’s ladder in the prospect’s mind? How many rungs are there on your ladder? It depends on whether your product is a high-interest or a low-interest product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products you use every day (cigarettes, cola, beer, toothpaste, cereal) tend to be high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products that are purchased infrequently (furniture, lawn mowers, luggage) usually have few rungs on their ladders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products that involve a great deal of personal pride (automobiles, watches, cameras) are also high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders even though they are purchased infrequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a relationship between market share and your position on the ladder in the prospect’s mind. You tend to have twice the market share of the brand below you and half the market share of the brand above you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s the maximum number of rungs on a ladder? There seems to be a rule of seven in the prospect’s mind. Ask someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ladder is a simple, but powerful, analogy that can help you deal with the critical issues in marketing. Before starting any marketing program, ask yourself the following questions: Where are we on the ladder in the prospect’s mind? On the top rung? On the second rung? Or maybe we’re not on the ladder at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then make sure your program deals realistically with your position on the ladder. More on how to do this later.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early on, a new category is a ladder of many rungs. Gradually, the ladder becomes a two-rung affair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you take the long view of marketing, you find the battle usually winds up as a titanic struggle between two major players — usually the old reliable brand and the upstart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We repeat: The customer believes that marketing is a battle of products. It’s this kind of thinking that keeps the two brands on top: “They must be the best, they’re the leaders. “&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to establish a firm foothold on the second rung of the ladder, study the firm above you. Where is it strong? And how do you turn that strength into a weakness? You must discover the essence of the leader and then present the prospect with the opposite. (In other words, don’t try to be better, try to be different.) It’s often the upstart versus old reliable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, by positioning yourself against the leader, you take business away from all the other alternatives to No. 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, too many potential No. 2 brands try to emulate the leader. This usually is an error. You must present yourself as the alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But don’t simply knock the competition. The law of the opposite is a two-edge sword. It requires honing in on a weakness that your prospect will quickly acknowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then quickly twist the sword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There has to be a ring of truth about the negative if it is to be effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing is often a battle for legitimacy. The first brand that captures the concept is often able to portray its competitors as illegitimate pretenders.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A category starts off as a single entity. Computers, for example. But over time, the category breaks up into other segments. Mainframes, minicomputers, workstations, personal computers, laptops, notebooks, pen computers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categories are dividing, not combining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies make a mistake when they try to take a well-known brand name in one category and use the same brand name in another category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What keeps leaders from launching a different brand to cover a new category is the fear of what will happen to their existing brands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timing is also important. You can be too early to exploit a new category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s better to be early than late. You can’t get into the prospect’s mind first unless you’re prepared to spend some time waiting for things to develop.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many marketing moves exhibit the same phenomenon. The long-term effects are often the exact opposite of the short-term effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does a sale increase a company’s business or decrease it? Obviously, in the short term, a sale increases business. But there’s more and more evidence to show that sales decrease business in the long term by educating customers not to buy at “regular “prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no evidence that couponing increases sales in the long run. Many companies find they need a quarterly dose of couponing to keep sales on an even keel. Once they stop couponing, sales drop off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless you know what to look for, it’s hard to see the effects of line extension, especially for managers focused on their next quarterly report.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s even more diabolical is that line extension is a process that takes place continuously, with almost no conscious effort on the part of the corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One day a company is tightly focused on a single product that is highly profitable. The next day the same company is spread thin over many products and is losing money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a narrow sense, line extension involves taking the brand name of a successful product (e.g., A-1 steak sauce) and putting it on a new product you plan to introduce (e.g., A-1 poultry sauce).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But marketing is a battle of perception, not product. In the mind, A-1 is not the brand name, but the steak sauce itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the long run and in the presence of serious competition, line extensions almost never work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invariably, the leader in any category is the brand that is not line extended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does top management believe that line extension works, in spite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary? One reason is that while line extension is a loser in the long term, it can be a winner in the short term ( chapter 11: The Law of Perspective ). Management is also blinded by an intense loyalty to the company or brand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More is less. The more products, the more markets, the more alliances a company makes, the less money it makes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less is more. If you want to be successful today, you have to narrow the focus in order to build a position in the prospect’s mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For many companies, line extension is the easy way out. Launching a new brand requires not only money, but also an idea or concept. For a new brand to succeed, it ought to be first in a new category (chapter 1: The Law of Leadership). Or the new brand ought to be positioned as an alternative to the leader (chapter 9: The Law of the Opposite). Companies that wait until a new market has developed often find these two leadership positions already preempted. So they fall back on the old reliable line extension approach. The antidote for line extension is corporate courage, a commodity in short supply.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The law of sacrifice is the opposite of the law of line extension. If you want to be successful today, you should give something up. There are three things to sacrifice: product line, target market, and constant change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, the product line. Where is it written that the more you have to sell, the more you sell?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full line is a luxury for a loser. If you want to be successful, you have to reduce your product line, not expand it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world of business is populated by big, highly diversified generalists and small, narrowly focused specialists. If line extension and diversification were effective marketing strategies, you’d expect to see the generalists riding high. But they’re not. Most of them are in trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The generalist is weak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s discuss the second sacrifice, target market. Where is it written that you have to appeal to everybody?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The target is not the market. That is, the apparent target of your marketing is not the same as the people who will actually buy your product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the third sacrifice: constant change. Where is it written that you have to change your strategy every year at budget review time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you try to follow the twists and turns of the market, you are bound to wind up off the road. The best way to maintain a consistent position is not to change it in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In chapter 6 (The Law of Exclusivity) we made the point that you can’t own the same word or position that your competitor owns. You must find your own word to own. You must seek out another attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s much better to search for an opposite attribute that will allow you to play off against the leader. The key word here is opposite—similar won’t do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing is a battle of ideas. So if you are to succeed, you must have an idea or attribute of your own to focus your efforts around. Without one, you had better have a low price. A very low price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some say all attributes are not created equal. Some attributes are more important to customers than others. You must try and own the most important attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the law of exclusivity points to the simple truth that once an attribute is successfully taken by your competition, it’s gone. You must move on to a lesser attribute and live with a smaller share of the category. Your job is to seize a different attribute, dramatize the value of your attribute, and thus increase your share.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It goes against corporate and human nature to admit a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So it may come as a surprise to you that one of the most effective ways to get into a prospect’s mind is to first admit a negative and then twist it into a positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s going on here? Why does a dose of honesty work so well in the marketing process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First and foremost, candor is very disarming. Every negative statement you make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth. Positive statements, on the other hand, are looked at as dubious at best. Especially in an advertisement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to prove a positive statement to the prospect’s satisfaction. No proof is needed for a negative statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your name is bad, you have two choices: change the name or make fun of it. The one thing you can’t do is to ignore a bad name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So why go with the obvious? Marketing is often a search for the obvious. Since you can’t change a mind once it’s made up, your marketing efforts have to be devoted to using ideas and concepts already installed in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a company starts a message by admitting a problem, people tend to, almost instinctively, open their minds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One final note: The law of candor must be used carefully and with great skill. First, your “negative “must be widely perceived as a negative. It has to trigger an instant agreement with your prospect’s mind. If the negative doesn’t register quickly, your prospect will be confused and will wonder, “What’s this all about?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, you have to shift quickly to the positive. The purpose of candor isn’t to apologize. The purpose of candor is to set up a benefit that will convince your prospect.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many marketing people see success as the sum total of a lot of small efforts beautifully executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History teaches that the only thing that works in marketing is the single, bold stroke. Furthermore, in any given situation there is only one move that will produce substantial results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So it is in marketing. Most often there is only one place where a competitor is vulnerable. And that place should be the focus of the entire invading force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find that singular idea or concept, marketing managers have to know what’s happening in the marketplace. They have to be down at the front in the mud of the battle. They have to know what’s working and what isn’t. They have to be involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s hard to find that single move if you’re hanging around headquarters and not involved in the process.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implicit in most marketing plans is an assumption about the future. Yet marketing plans based on what will happen in the future are usually wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure to forecast competitive reaction is a major reason for marketing failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most companies live from quarterly report to quarterly report. That’s a recipe for problems. Companies that live by the numbers, die by the numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good short-term planning is coming up with that angle or word that differentiates your product or company. Then you set up a coherent long-term marketing direction that builds a program to maximize that idea or angle. It’s not a long-term plan, it’s a long-term direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So what can you do? How can you best cope with unpredictability? While you can’t predict the future, you can get a handle on trends, which is a way to take advantage of change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The danger in working with trends is extrapolation. Many companies jump to conclusions about how far a trend will go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equally as bad as extrapolating a trend is the common practice of assuming the future will be a replay of the present. When you assume that nothing will change, you are predicting the future just as surely as when you assume that something will change. Remember Peter’s Law: The unexpected always happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While tracking trends can be a useful tool in dealing with the unpredictable future, market research can be more of a problem than a help. Research does best at measuring the past. New ideas and concepts are almost impossible to measure. No one has a frame of reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One way to cope with an unpredictable world is to build an enormous amount of flexibility into your organization. As change comes sweeping through your category, you have to be willing to change and change quickly if you are to survive in the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One final note that’s worth mentioning: There’s a difference between “predicting “the future and “taking a chance “on the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one can predict the future with any degree of certainty. Nor should marketing plans try to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego is the enemy of successful marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objectivity is what’s needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people become successful, they tend to become less objective. They often substitute their own judgment for what the market wants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually it’s the opposite. The name didn’t make the brand famous ( although a bad name might keep the brand from becoming famous ). The brand got famous because you made the right marketing moves. In other words, the steps you took were in tune with the fundamental laws of marketing. You got into the mind first. You narrowed the focus. You preempted a powerful attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually, ego is helpful. It can be an effective driving force in building a business. What hurts is injecting your ego in the marketing process. Brilliant marketers have the ability to think like a prospect thinks. They put themselves in the shoes of their customers. They don’t impose their own view of the world on the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bigger the company, the more likely it is that the chief executive has lost touch with the front lines. This might be the single most important factor limiting the growth of a corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re a busy CEO, how do you gather objective information on what is really happening? How do you get around the propensity of middle management to tell you what they think you want to hear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you get the bad news as well as the good?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One possibility is to go “in disguise “or unannounced. This is especially useful at the distributor or retailer level. In many ways this is analogous to the king who dresses up as a commoner and mingles with his subjects. Reason: to get honest opinions of what’s happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing is too important to be turned over to an underling. If you delegate anything, you should delegate the chairmanship of the next fund-raising drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next thing to cut back on are the meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small companies are mentally closer to the front than big companies. That might be one reason they grew more rapidly in the last decade. They haven’t been tainted by the law of success.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too many companies try to fix things rather than drop things. “Let’s reorganize to save the situation “is their way of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admitting a mistake and not doing anything about it is bad for your career. A better strategy is to recognize failure early and cut your losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One way to defuse the personal agenda factor is to bring it out in the open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the 3M system works, in theory the ideal environment would allow managers to judge a concept on its merits, not on whom the concept would benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a company is going to operate in an ideal way, it will take teamwork, esprit de corps, and a self-sacrificing leader.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When things are going well, a company doesn’t need the hype. When you need the hype, it usually means you’re in trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only revolutions you can predict are the ones that have already started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget the front page. If you’re looking for clues to the future, look in the back of the paper for those innocuous little stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But, for the most part, hype is hype. Real revolutions don’t arrive at high noon with marching bands and coverage on the 6:00 P.M. news. Real revolutions arrive unannounced in the middle of the night and kind of sneak up on you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fad is a wave in the ocean, and a trend is the tide. A fad gets a lot of hype, and a trend gets very little.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a wave, a fad is very visible, but it goes up and down in a big hurry. Like the tide, a trend is almost invisible, but it’s very powerful over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fad is a short-term phenomenon that might be profitable, but a fad doesn’t last long enough to do a company much good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the fad disappears, a company often goes into a deep financial shock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here’s the paradox. If you were faced with a rapidly rising business, with all the characteristics of a fad, the best thing you could do would be to dampen the fad. By dampening the fad, you stretch the fad out and it becomes more like a trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget fads. And when they appear, try to dampen them. One way to maintain a long-term demand for your product is to never totally satisfy the demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the best, most profitable thing to ride in marketing is a long-term trend.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a good idea and you’ve picked up this book with the thought in mind that all you need is a little marketing help, this chapter will throw cold water on that thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the best idea in the world won’t go very far without the money to get it off the ground. Inventors, entrepreneurs, and assorted idea generators seem to think that all their good ideas need is professional marketing help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing could be further from the truth. Marketing is a game fought in the mind of the prospect. You need money to get into a mind. And you need money to stay in the mind once you get there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll get further with a mediocre idea and a million dollars than with a great idea alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideas without money are worthless. Well … not quite. But you have to use your idea to find the money, not the marketing help. The marketing can come later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember: An idea without money is worthless. Be prepared to give away a lot for the funding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In marketing, the rich often get richer because they have the resources to drive their ideas into the mind. Their problem is separating the good ideas from the bad ones, and avoiding spending money on too many products and too many programs (chapter 5: The Law of Focus).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike a consumer product, a technical or business product has to raise less marketing money because the prospect list is shorter and media is less expensive. But there is still a need for adequate funding for a technical product to pay for brochures, sales presentations, and trade shows as well as advertising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is the bottom line. First get the idea, then go get the money to exploit it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So far we’ve been talking about smaller companies and their fund-raising strategies. What about a rich company? How should it approach the law of resources? The answer is simple: Spend enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more successful marketers front load their investment. In other words, they take no profit for two or three years as they plow all earnings back into marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money makes the marketing world go round. If you want to be successful today, you’ll have to find the money you need to spin those marketing wheels.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a legend that this little book was Napoleon’s key to success and his secret weapon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always remember, since ancient times, it has been known that…” the true object of war is peace.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is an ideal to aim for, it should be that of the strategic warrior, the man or woman who manages difficult situations and people through deft and intelligent maneuvers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our successes and failures in life can be traced to how well or how badly we deal with the inevitable conflicts that confront us in society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at things as they are, not as your emotions colour them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only remedy is to be aware that the pull of emotion is inevitable, to notice it when it is happening, and to compensate for it. When you have success, be extra wary. When you are angry, take no action. When you are fearful, know you will exaggerate the dangers you face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge people by their actions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depend on your arms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the true strategy is psychological—a matter of intelligence, not material force. Everything in life can be taken away from you and generally will be at some point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having superior strategies at your fingertips will give your maneuvers irresistible force. As Sun-Tzu says, “Being unconquerable lies with yourself.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worship Athena, not Ares.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ares was the god of war in its direct and brutal form. The Greeks despised Ares and worshipped Athena, who always fought with the utmost intelligence and subtlety. Your interest in war is not the violence, the brutality, or the waste of lives and resources, but the rationality and pragmatism it forces on us and the ideal of winning without bloodshed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In war, strategy is the art of commanding the entire military operation. Tactics, on the other hand, is the skill of forming the army for the battle itself and dealing with the immediate needs of the battlefield.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To have the power that only strategy can bring, you must be able to &lt;strong&gt;elevate yourself above the battlefield&lt;/strong&gt;, focus on your long-term objectives, craft an entire campaign, to get out of the reactive mode that so many battles in life lock you into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping your overall goals in mind, it becomes much easier to decide when to fight and when to walk away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spiritualize your warfare.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every day, you face battles—that is the reality for all creatures in their struggle to survive. But the greatest battle of all is with yourself—your weaknesses, emotions, and lack of resolution in seeing things through to the end. You must declare unceasing war on yourself. As a warrior in life, you welcome combat and conflict as ways to prove yourself, to better your skills, and to gain courage, confidence, and experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road to safety or ruin. Hence under no circumstances can it be neglected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared. Appear where you are not expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three ways in which a sovereign can bring misfortune upon his army:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By commanding the army to advance or retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions in an army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we may know that there are five essentials for victory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will win who has the military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you know the enemy and yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will also suffer a defeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;tactics&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#tactics&quot; aria-label=&quot;tactics permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tactics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the enemy himself provides the opportunity of defeating the enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general skilled in defence hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position that makes defeat impossible and does not miss the moment to defeat the enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;energy&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#energy&quot; aria-label=&quot;energy permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Energy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed to secure victory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, the good fighter will be terrible in his onset and prompt in his decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appear at points the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places you are not expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general that is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defence whose opponent does not know what to attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Military tactics are like unto water, for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downward. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory against the foe he is facing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare, there are no constant conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He who can modify his tactics about his opponent, and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without harmony in the state, no military expedition can be undertaken; without harmony in the army, no battle array can be formed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An army without its baggage train is lost; without provisions, it is lost; without bases of supply, it is lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ponder and deliberate before you make a move. He will conquer those who have learned the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In battle, a courageous spirit is everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A clever general avoids an army when its spirit is keen but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you surround an enemy, leave an outlet free. This does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to escape. The object is to make him believe that there is a road to safety and thus prevent his fighting with the courage of despair.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No town should be attacked which, if taken, cannot be held or, if left alone, will not cause any trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the wise leader’s plans, considerations of advantages and disadvantages will be blended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy not coming but on our readiness to receive him, not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Five dangerous faults may affect a general, of which the first two are: recklessness, which leads to destruction, and cowardice, which leads to capture.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, there is a delicacy of honour, which is sensitive to shame, and a hasty temper, which insults can provoke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last of such faults is over solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble, for, in the long run, the troops will suffer more from the defeat, or at best, the prolongation of the war, which will be the consequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To begin by blustering but afterward to take fright at the enemy’s numbers shows a supreme lack of intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, an army is exposed to calamities, not from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: flight; insubordination; collapse; ruin; disorganization; rout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we know that our men are in a condition to attack but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway toward victory. If we know that the enemy is open to attack but are unaware that our men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway toward victory. If we know that the enemy is open to attack and that our men are in a condition to attack but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway toward victory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know the enemy and you know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapidity is the essence of war. Take advantage of the enemy’s unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will not succeed unless your men have tenacity, unity of purpose, and a spirit of sympathetic cooperation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, the skillful general keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy’s purpose. If the enemy shows an inclination to advance, lure him on to do so; if he is anxious to retreat, delay on purpose that he may carry out his intention.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreknowledge enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having converted spies means getting hold of the enemy’s spies and using them for our purposes: employing heavy bribes and liberal promises, detaching them from the enemy’s service and inducing them to carry back false information and to spy in turn on their countrymen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There must be no more intimate relations in the whole army than those maintained by spies. No other relation should be more liberally rewarded. In no other relation should greater secrecy be preserved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether the object is to crush an army, storm a city, or assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, the doorkeepers, and the sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; this knowledge can only be derived from the converted spy in the first instance. He not only brings information himself but makes it possible to use the other kinds of spies to his advantage. Hence the converted spy must be treated with the utmost liberality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spies are a most important element in war because an army’s ability to move depends upon them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To become a true strategist, you must become aware of the weakness and illnesses that can take hold of the mind. You must declare war on yourself to make yourself move forward.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to identify your enemies and then inwardly declare war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your enemies, like the opposite poles of a magnet, can fill you with purpose and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more clearly you define who you do not want to be, the clearer your sense of identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See yourself as a fighter surrounded by enemies. The constant battle keeps you strong and alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be lured by the need to be liked: better to be respected, even feared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt;: people tend to be vague and slippery because it is safer than outwardly committing to something. If you are the boss, they will mimic your ideas. Their agreement is often pure courtship. Get them emotional; people are usually more sincere when they argue. If you pick an argument with someone and he keeps mimicking your ideas, you may be dealing with a chameleon, a particularly dangerous type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tough opponent will bring out the best in you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always keep the search for and use of enemies under control. It is the clarity you want, not paranoia. It is the downfall of many tyrants to see an enemy in everyone. They lose their grip on reality and become hopelessly embroiled in the emotions their paranoia churns up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most often weighs you down and brings you misery is the past, in the form of unnecessary attachments, repetitions of tired formulas, and the memory of old victories and defeats. You must consciously wage war against the past and force yourself to react to the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never take it for granted that your past successes will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt;: the greatest generals, the most creative strategists, stand out not because they have more knowledge but because they are able, when necessary, to drop their preconceived notions and focus intensely on the present moment. That is how creativity is sparked, and opportunities are seized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be valuable to analyze what went wrong in the past, but it is far more important to develop the capacity to think at the moment. In that way, you will make far fewer mistakes to analyze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first step is to be aware of the process and the need to fight it. The second is to adopt a few tactics that might help you to restore the mind’s natural flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reexamine all your cherished beliefs and principles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your only principle, similarly, should be to have no principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erase the memory of the last war.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attention to the present details is the best way to crowd out the past and forget the last war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the mind moving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superior strategists see things as they are. They are highly sensitive to dangers and opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great strategists do not act according to preconceived ideas; they respond to the moment, like children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorb the spirit of the times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly adapt and change, and you will avoid the pitfalls of your previous wars. Just when people feel they know you, you will change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse course.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, you must reverse course and break free from the hold of the past. Do the opposite of what you would normally do in a given situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act in a novel manner in relationships to break up the dynamic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must actively resist the emotional pull of the moment, maintaining your mental powers whatever the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your mind tougher by exposing it to adversity. Learn to detach yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hyperaggressive Tactic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In turmoil and trouble, you must force yourself to be more determined and aggressive. Any mistakes you make can be rectified with more aggression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Detached-Buddha Tactic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presence of mind is the ability to detach yourself and see the battlefield with clarity. What gives you that distance is preparation, mastering the details beforehand. Let people think your Buddha-like detachment comes from some mysterious source. The less they understand you, the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal discipline and toughness make your mind stronger and more able to control your emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one can teach you this skill. It can only come through practice, experience, and even a little suffering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To toughen your mind:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expose yourself to conflict.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is better to confront your fears than to ignore them or tamp them down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more conflicts and difficult situations you put yourself through, the more battle-tested your mind will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be self-reliant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependency makes you vulnerable to all kinds of emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to overestimate other people’s abilities, and we tend to underestimate our own. Compensate for this by trusting yourself more and others less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, being self-reliant does not mean burdening yourself with petty details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suffer fools gladly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your time and energy are limited, and you must learn how to preserve them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, think of fools as you think of children or pets, not important enough to affect your mental balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowd out feelings of panic by focusing on simple tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unintimidate yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See the person, not the myth. Imagine him or her as a child, as someone riddled with insecurities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop your Fingerspitzengefuhl (fingertip feel).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presence of mind depends not only on your mind’s ability to come to your aid in difficult situations but also on the speed with which this happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are things you can do to help you respond faster and bring out that intuitively feel that all animals possess. Deep knowledge of the terrain will let you process information faster than your enemy, a tremendous advantage. Getting a feel for the spirit of men and material, thinking your way into them instead of looking at them from outside, will help to put you in a different frame of mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your mind into the habit of making lightning-quick decisions, trusting your fingertip feel. Your mind will advance in a mental blitzkrieg, moving past your opponents before they realize what has hit them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are your own worst enemy. You waste precious time dreaming of the future instead of engaging in the present. Since nothing seems urgent to you, you are only half involved in what you do. The only way to change is through action and outside pressure. Put yourself in situations where you have too much at stake to waste time or resources—if you cannot afford to lose, you won’t. Cut your ties to the past; enter unknown territory where you must depend on your wits and energy to see you through. Place yourself on “death ground,” where your back is against the wall, and you must fight like hell to get out alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The No-Return Tactic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the back of your mind, you keep an escape route, a crutch, something to turn to if things go bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may see this fallback as a blessing, but it is a curse. It divides you. Because you think you have options, you need to involve yourself deeply enough in one thing to do it thoroughly, and you never quite get what you want. Sometimes you need to burn the ships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Death-at-Your-Heels Tactic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must think of death to embrace your limited days left. Make the most of them and live with a sense of urgency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put yourself in a comfortable situation, and you may grow bored or tired. Put yourself in a high-stakes situation, and the dynamic changes. You get a surge of energy, and your mind focuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the following five actions to put yourself on a psychological death ground:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stake everything on a single throw.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is better to take on one daunting challenge than diffuse our efforts across many.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act before you are ready.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do this often, and you will develop your ability to think and act fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter new waters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave stale relationships and comfortable situations behind, and cut your ties to the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it “you against the world.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fighting spirit needs a little edge, some anger and hatred to fuel it. Get aggressive and irritate and infuriate people directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep yourself restless and unsatisfied.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make risk a constant practice; never let yourself settle down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life has more meaning in the face of death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never attack enemies with anything to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, attacking enemies when morale is low gives you the advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always try to lower the other side’s sense of urgency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the structure of your army - the chain of command and the relationship of the parts to the whole - that will give your strategies force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must build speed and mobility into the structure of your army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That means having a single authority on top, going soldiers a sense of the overall goal to be accomplished and the latitude to take action to meet that goal. It means motivating soldiers, and creating an overall esprit du corps that gives momentum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before formulating a strategy or taking action, understand the structure of your group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem in leading any group is that people inevitably have agendas. If you are too authoritarian, they will resent you and rebel silently. If you are too easygoing, they will revert to their natural selfishness, and you will lose control. You must create a chain of command in which people do not feel constrained by your influence but follow your lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a sense of participation, but do not fall into Groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proper chain of command, and the control it brings you, is not an accident; it is your creation, a work of art that requires constant attention and care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the game you must play: Do whatever you can to pressure unity of command. At the same time, hide your tracks. Work behind the scenes; make the group feel involved in your decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical step in creating an efficient chain of command is assembling a skilled team that shares your goals and values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In creating this team, you are looking for people who make up for your deficiencies and have the skills you lack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful in assembling this team that you are not seduced by expertise and intelligence. Character, the ability to work under you and with the rest of the team, and the capacity to accept responsibility and think independently are equally key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The single greatest risk to your chain of command comes from the political animals in the group. Try to weed them out before they arrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, pay attention to the orders themselves—their form and substance. Vague orders are worthless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, if your commands are too specific and narrow, you will encourage people to behave like automatons and stop thinking for themselves—which they must do when the situation requires it. Erring in neither direction is an art.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed and adaptability are critical elements in war and come from a flexible organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralize your army, segment it into teams, and let go a little to gain mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give your different corps clear missions that fit your strategic goals, then let them accomplish them as they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The essence of strategy is not to carry out a brilliant plan that proceeds in steps; it is to put yourself in situations where you have more options than the enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to the mission command is an overall group philosophy. This can be built around the cause you are fighting for or a belief in the evil of the enemy you face. It can also include the style of warfare—defensive, mobile, ruthlessly aggressive—that best suits it. You must bring the group together around this belief. Then, through training and creative exercises, you must deepen its hold on them and infuse it into their blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group. Involve them in a cause, a crusade against a hated enemy. Make them see their survival as tied to the army’s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead from the front: let your soldiers see you in the trenches, making sacrifices for the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of Man Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the best group dynamic, follow as many of the following steps as possible:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Unite your troops around a cause. Make them fight for an idea.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cause can be anything you wish, but you should represent it as progressive: it fits the times, it is on the side of the future, so it is destined to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Keep their bellies full.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People cannot stay motivated if their material needs go unmet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Lead from the front.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Concentrate on their ch’i.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idleness has a terrible effect on chi’i.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your soldiers busy, acting for a purpose, moving in a direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6: Mix harshness and kindness.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to man management is a balance of punishment and reward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7: Build the group myth.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The armies with the highest morale have been tested in battle. Soldiers who have fought alongside one another through many campaigns forge a kind of group myth based on their past victories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To generate this myth, you must lead your troops into as many campaigns as possible. It is wise to start with easy battles they can win, building their confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 8: Be ruthless with grumblers.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above all else, pay attention to your staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morale is contagious, and you, as a leader, set the tone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If aiming at emotions, you must aim indirectly: get them to laugh or cry over something that seems unrelated to the issue. Emotions are contagious - they bring people together and make them bond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To fight defensively, you must make the most of your resources, fighting with perfect economy and only necessary battles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, you must know how and when to retreat, luring an aggressive enemy into an imprudent attack. Then, when exhausted, launch a vicious counterattack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To fight this way, you must master the arts of deception.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must know your limits and pick your battles carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyrrhic victories are much more common than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No person or group is completely weak or strong. You must make sure to assess and attack weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creativity gives you an edge over enemies dependent on technology; you will learn more, be more adaptable, and outsmart them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next time you launch a campaign, try an experiment: think deeply about what you have first, then let your plans and goals blossom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not mistake cheapness for the perfect economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several tactics are key to fighting economically:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of deception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing opponents you can beat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for new opportunities and build momentum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no value in fighting without the economy, but it is always wise to make your opponent waste as many resources as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving first will often put you at a disadvantage: you are exposing your strategy and limiting your options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, let the other side move first or bait opponents into rash attacks that will leave them weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing weak and catching them off guard with an attack is also a good tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make jujitsu your style in almost everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first step in mastering the counterattack is to master yourself, particularly the tendency to grow emotional in conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to a successful counterattack is staying calm while your opponent gets frustrated and irritable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mirroring people - going back to them just what they give to you - is a powerful method of counterattack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, encouraging people to follow their natural direction to give in to their greed or neuroses will die you more control over them than active resistance will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The modern dilemma is that taking the offensive is unacceptable today—attack and your reputation will suffer, you will find yourself politically isolated, and you will create enemies and resistance. The counterattack is the answer. Let your enemy make the first move, then play the victim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to fight off aggressors is to keep them from attacking you in the first place. To accomplish this, you must create the impression of being more powerful than you are. Build up a reputation: You’re a little crazy. Fighting you is not worth it. You take your enemies with you when you lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This art of deterrence rests on three basic facts about war and human nature: First, people are more likely to attack you if they see you as weak or vulnerable. Second, they cannot know for sure that you’re weak; they depend on the signs you give out through your present and past behaviour. Third, they are after easy victories, quick and bloodless. That is why they prey on the vulnerable and weak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following are five basic methods of deterrence and reverse intimidation. You can use them all in offensive warfare, but they are particularly effective in defence:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise with a bold maneuver.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will have two positive effects: First, they will tend to think your move is backed up by something real—they will not imagine you could be foolish enough to do something audacious just for effect. Second, they will start to see strengths and threats in you that they had not imagined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse the threat.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn the tables with a sudden move designed to scare them. Threaten something they value. You needn’t go too far and inflict a little pain to indicate you can get worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seem unpredictable and irrational.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this instance, you do something suggesting a slightly suicidal streak, as if you felt you had nothing to lose. You show that you are ready to destroy your enemies’ reputations. (This is particularly effective with people with a lot to lose themselves—powerful people with sterling reputations.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play on people’s natural paranoia.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of threatening your opponents openly, you take indirect action designed to make them think. This might mean using a go-between to send them a message—to tell some disturbing story about what you can do. Or maybe you “inadvertently” let them spy on you, only to hear something that should cause them concern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a frightening reputation.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This reputation can be for any number of things: difficult, stubborn, violent, ruthlessly efficient. Build that image over the years, and people will back off you, treating you with respect and a little fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;trade-space-for-time-the-nonengagement-strategy&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#trade-space-for-time-the-nonengagement-strategy&quot; aria-label=&quot;trade space for time the nonengagement strategy permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Trade Space for Time: The Nonengagement Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retreat in the face of a strong enemy is a sign not of weakness but of strength. By resisting the temptation to respond to an aggressor, you buy yourself valuable time—time to recover, to think, and to gain perspective. Let your enemies advance; time is more important than space. By refusing to fight, you infuriate them and feed their arrogance. They will soon overextend themselves and start making mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your task as a strategist is simple: to see the differences between yourself and others, to understand yourself, your side, and the enemy as well as you can, to get more perspective on events, and to know things for what they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest dangers in war and life come from the unexpected: people do not respond the way you had thought they would, events mess up your plans and produce confusion, and circumstances are overwhelming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In strategy, the discrepancy between what you want to happen and what does happen is called friction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea behind conventional offensive warfare is simple: by attacking the other side first, you create your own circumstances before friction can creep in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be successful at offensive warfare, you must plan in intense detail, thinking in terms of the whole campaign, not individual battles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grand strategy is the art of looking beyond the battle and calculating ahead. It requires focusing on the ultimate goal and considering your actions’ politics and long-term consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become a grand strategist in life, you must follow the path of Alexander. First, clarify your life—decipher your riddle—by determining what it is you are destined to achieve, the direction in which your skills and talents seem to push you. Visualize yourself fulfilling this destiny in glorious detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignore the conventional wisdom about what you should or should not be doing. It may make sense for some, but that does not mean it relates to your goals and destiny. You need to be patient enough to plot several steps ahead—to wage a campaign instead of fighting battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your task as a grand strategist is to extend your vision in all directions—not only looking further into the future but also seeing more of the world around you, more than your enemy does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first step was to think beyond the immediate battle. Supposing you won a victory, where would it leave you—better off or worse? To answer that question, the logical step was to think ahead to the third and fourth battles, which connected like links in a chain. The result was the campaign’s concept: the strategist sets a realistic goal and plots several steps ahead to get there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grand strategy has four main principles. The more you can incorporate these principles into your plans, the better the results:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on your greater goal, your destiny.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have distinguished all history’s grand strategists and can distinguish you, too, are specific, detailed, focused goals. Contemplate them day in and day out, and imagine how it will feel to reach them and what reaching them will look like. By a psychological law peculiar to humans, visualizing them this way will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your goals must be rooted in reality. If they are beyond your means and impossible for you to realize, you will grow discouraged, and discouragement can quickly escalate into a defeatist attitude. On the other hand, if your goals lack a certain dimension and grandeur, it can be hard to stay motivated. Do not be afraid to be bold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widen your perspective.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grand strategy is a function of vision, of seeing further in time and space than the enemy does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your task as a grand strategist is to force yourself to widen your view, to take in more of the world around you, to see things for what they are and how they may play out in the future, not for how you wish them to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severe the roots.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a society dominated by appearances, the real source of a problem is sometimes hard to grasp. To work out a grand strategy against an enemy, you have to know what motivates him or is the source of his power - the roots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take the indirect route to your goal.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest danger you face in strategy is losing the initiative and finding yourself constantly reacting to what the other side does. The solution, of course, is to plan ahead and subtly—to take the indirect route. Preventing your opponent from seeing the purpose of your actions gives you an enormous advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever anything goes wrong, it is human nature to blame this person or that. Let other people engage in such stupidity, led around by their noses, seeing only what is immediately visible. You see things differently. When an action goes wrong—in business, politics, or life—trace it back to the policy that inspired it in the first place. The goal was misguided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means that you are largely the agent of anything bad that happens to you. You could have avoided the danger with more prudence, wiser policies, and greater vision. So when something goes wrong, look deep into yourself—not in an emotional way, to blame yourself or indulge your feelings of guilt, but to make sure that you start your next campaign with a firmer step and greater vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The target of your strategies should be less the army you face than the mind of the man or woman who runs it. If you understand how that mind works, you have the key to deceiving and controlling it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our natural tendency is to see other people as mere reflections of our desires and values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to find the leader’s weaknesses is not through spies but through a close embrace. Behind a friendly, even subservient front, you can observe your enemies and get them to open up and reveal themselves. Get inside their skin; think as they think. Once you discover their vulnerability—an uncontrollable temper, a weakness for the opposite sex, a gnawing insecurity—you have the material to destroy them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest power you could have in life would come neither from limitless resources nor even consummate skill in strategy. It would come from a clear knowledge of those around you—the ability to read people like a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, it is easier to observe people in action, particularly in moments of crisis. Those are the times when they either reveal their weakness or struggle so hard to disguise it that you can see through the mask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warning: never rely on one spy, one source of information, no matter how good. You risk being played or getting slanted, one-sided information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the enemy you are dealing with is not an inanimate object that will respond expectedly to your strategies. Your enemies are constantly changing and adapting to what you are doing. Innovating and inventing on their own, they try to learn from their mistakes and your successes. So your knowledge of the enemy cannot be static. Keep your intelligence up to date, and do not rely on the enemy’s responding the same way twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even as you work to know your enemies, you must make yourself as formless and difficult to read as possible. Since people only have appearances to go on, they can be readily deceived. Act unpredictably now and then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a world where many people are indecisive and overly cautious, using speed will bring you untold power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This strategy works best with a setup, a lull - your unexpected action catches your enemy off guard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We live in a world where speed is prized above almost all else and acting faster than the other side has become the primary goal. But most often, people are merely in a hurry, acting and reacting frantically to events, making them prone to error and wasting time in the long run. To separate yourself from the pack, to harness a speed that has devastating force, you must be organized and strategic. First, you prepare before any action, scanning your enemy for weaknesses. Then you find a way to get your opponents to underestimate you, to lower their guard. When you strike unexpectedly, they will freeze up. When you hit it again, it is from the side and out of nowhere. It is the unanticipated blow that makes the biggest impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Velocity creates a sense of vitality. Moving with speed means there is less time for you and your army to make mistakes. It also creates a bandwagon effect: more and more people admiring your boldness will decide to join forces with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This strategy can be devastating for those who are hesitant or afraid of making mistakes or those who have divided leadership or internal cracks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appearing slow can be an advantage, particularly as a setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, when facing a fast enemy, the only true defence is to be faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are constantly struggling to control you—getting you to act in their interests, keeping the dynamic on their terms. The only way to get the upper hand is to make your play for control more intelligent and insidious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift the conflict to the terrain of your choice, altering the pace and stakes to suit you. Maneuver to control your opponents’ minds, pushing their emotional buttons, and compelling them to make mistakes. If necessary, let them feel they are in control to get them to lower their guard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of Ultimate Control&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The superior strategist understands that it is impossible to control exactly how an enemy will respond to this move or that. To attempt to do so will only lead to frustration and exhaustion. There is too much in war and unpredictable life. But if the strategist can control the mood and mindset of his enemies, it does not matter exactly how they respond to his maneuvers. If he can make them frightened, panicky, overly aggressive, and angry, he controls the wider scope of their actions and can trap them mentally before cornering them physically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control can be aggressive or passive. It can be an immediate push on the enemy, making him back up and lose the initiative. It can be playing possum, getting the enemy to lower his guard, or baiting him into a rash attack. The artist of control weaves both into a devastating pattern—hitting, backing off, baiting, overwhelming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are four basic principles of the art:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep them on their heels.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the enemy makes a move before the element of chance or the unexpected actions of your opponents can ruin your plans, you make an aggressive move to seize the initiative. You then keep up relentless pressure, exploiting this momentary advantage to the fullest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shift the battlefield.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An enemy naturally wants to fight you on familiar terrain. The terrain, in this sense, means all of the details of the battle—the time and place, exactly what is being fought over, who is involved in the struggle, and so on. By subtly shifting your enemies into places and situations that are not familiar to them, you control the dynamic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compel mistakes.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your enemies depend on executing a strategy that plays to their advantage and that has worked in the past. Your task is twofold: to fight the battle in such a way that they cannot bring their strength or strategy into play and to create such a level of frustration that they make mistakes in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assume passive control.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate form of domination is to make those on the other side think they are in control. Believing they are in command, they are less likely to resist you or become defensive. You create this impression by moving with the other side’s energy, giving ground but slowly and subtly diverting them in the direction you desire. It is often the best way to control the overly aggressive and the passive-aggressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To control the dynamic, you must be able to control yourself and your emotions. Getting angry and lashing out will only limit your options. And in conflict, fear is the most debilitating emotion of all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before anything else, you must lose your fear—of death, of the consequences of a bold maneuver, of other people’s opinion of you. That single moment will suddenly open up vistas of possibilities. And in the end, whichever side has more possibilities for positive action has greater control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone has a source of power on which he or she depends. When you look at your rivals, search below the surface for that source, the center of gravity that holds the entire structure together. That center can be their wealth, popularity, key position, and winning strategy. Hitting them there will inflict disproportionate pain. Find what the other side most cherishes and protects—that is where you must strike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key is analyzing the enemy force to determine its centers of gravity. In looking for those centers, it is crucial not to be misled by the intimidating or dazzling exterior, mistaking the outward appearance for what sets it in motion. You will probably have to take several steps, one by one, to uncover this ultimate power source, peeling away layer after layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find a group’s center of gravity, you must understand its structure and the culture within which it operates. If your enemies are individuals, you must fathom their psychology, what makes them tick, and the structure of their thinking and priorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is almost always strategically wise to disrupt your enemy’s lines of communication; if the parts cannot communicate with the whole, chaos ensues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your enemy’s center of gravity can be something abstract, like a quality, concept, or aptitude on which he depends: his reputation, capacity to deceive, or unpredictability. But such strengths become critical vulnerabilities if you can make them unattractive or unusable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you look at your enemies, do not be intimidated by their appearance. Instead, look at the parts that make up the whole. Separating the parts, sowing dissension and division from within, you can weaken and bring down even the most formidable foe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In setting up your attack, work on their minds to create internal conflict. The joints are the weakest part of any structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to make an enemy divide is to occupy the centre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of battle or conflict as existing on a kind of chessboard. The chessboard’s center can be physical—an actual place like Marathon—or more subtle and psychological: the levers of power within a group, the support of a critical ally, a troublemaker at the eye of the storm. Take the centre of the chessboard, and the enemy will naturally break into parts, trying to hit you from more than one side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make people join you, separate them from their past. When you size up your targets, look for what connects them to the past, the source of their resistance to the new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A joint is the weakest part of any structure. Break it, and you divide people internally, making them vulnerable to suggestions and change. Divide their minds to conquer them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The divide-and-conquer strategy has never been more effective than today: cut people off from their group—make them feel alienated, alone, and unprotected—and weaken them enormously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide and rule is a powerful strategy for governing any group. It is based on a key principle: within any organization, people naturally form smaller groups based on mutual self-interest—the primitive desire to find strength in numbers. These subgroups form power bases that, left unchecked, will threaten the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution is to divide to rule. To do so, you must establish yourself as the center of power; individuals must know they need to compete for your approval. There has to be more to be gained by pleasing the leader than by trying to form a power base within the group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The divide-and-rule strategy is invaluable in trying to influence people verbally. Start by taking your opponents’ side on some issue, occupying their flank. Once there, however, create doubt about some part of their argument, tweaking and diverting it a bit. This will lower their resistance and maybe create a little inner conflict about a cherished idea or belief. That conflict will weaken them, making them vulnerable to further suggestions and guidance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you attack people directly, you stiffen their resistance and make your task much harder. There is a better way: distract your opponents’ attention to the front, then attack them from the side, where they least expect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals often show their flank, signalling their vulnerability, by its opposite, the front they show most visibly to the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life is full of hostility—some of it overt, some clever and under-handed. Conflict is inevitable; you will never have total peace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At all costs, you must gain control of the impulse to fight your opponents directly. Instead, occupy their flank. Disarm them and make them your ally; you can decide later whether to keep them on your side or to exact revenge. Taking the fight out of people through strategic acts of kindness, generosity, and charm will clear your path, helping you to save energy for the fights you cannot avoid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people who win true power in the difficult modern world are those who have learned indirection. They know the value of approaching at an angle, disguising their intentions, lowering the enemy’s resistance, and hitting the soft, exposed flank instead of butting horns. Rather than try to push or pull people, they coax them to turn in the direction they desire. This takes effort but pays dividends down the road in reduced conflict and greater results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to any flanking maneuver is to proceed in steps. Your initial move cannot reveal your intentions or true line of attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people present their ideas and arguments, they often censor themselves, trying to appear more conciliatory and flexible than is the case. If you attack them directly from the front, you end up not getting very far because there isn’t much there to aim at. Instead, try to make them go further with their ideas, giving you a bigger target. Do this by standing back, seeming to go along, and baiting them into moving rashly ahead. (You can also make them emotional, pushing their buttons, getting them to say more than they had wanted to.) They will expose themselves to a weak salient, advancing an indefensible argument or position that will make them look ridiculous. The key is never to strike too early. Give your opponents time to hang themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more subtle and indirect your maneuvers in life, the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate evolution of strategy is toward more and more indirection. An opponent who cannot see where you are heading is severely disadvantaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will use any gap in your defences to attack you or avenge yourself. So offer no gaps. The secret is to envelop your opponents—create relentless pressure on them from all sides, dominate their attention, and close off their access to the outside world. Make your attacks unpredictable to create a vaporous feeling of vulnerability. Finally, as you sense their weakening resolve, crush their willpower by tightening the noose. The best encirclements are psychological—you have surrounded their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many ways to envelop your opponents. Still, perhaps the simplest is to put whatever strength or advantage you naturally have to maximum use in a strategy of the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To envelop your enemies, you must use whatever you have in abundance. If you have a large army, use it to create the appearance that your forces are everywhere, an encircling pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember: the power of envelopment is ultimately psychological. Making the other side feel vulnerable to attack many sides is as good as enveloping them physically.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, less is more here: too many blows will give you a shape, a personality—something for the other side to respond to and develop a strategy to combat. Instead seem vaporous. Make your maneuvers impossible to anticipate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best encirclements prey on the enemy’s preexisting, inherent vulnerabilities. Be attentive to signs of arrogance, rashness, or other psychological weakness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The impetuous, violent, and arrogant are particularly easy to lure into the traps of envelopment strategies: play weak or dumb, and they will charge ahead without stopping to think about where they’re going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The danger of envelopment is that it may leave you vulnerable unless it is completely successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how strong you are, fighting endless battles with people is exhausting, costly, and unimaginative. Wise strategists generally prefer the art of maneuver: before the battle even begins, they find ways to put their opponents in positions of such weakness that victory is easy and quick. Bait enemies into taking positions that may seem alluring but are traps and blind alleys. If their position is strong, get them to abandon it by leading them on a wild-goose chase. Create dilemmas: devise maneuvers that give them a choice of ways to respond—all of them bad. Channel chaos and disorder in their direction. Confused, frustrated, and angry opponents are like ripe fruit on the bough: the slightest breeze will make them fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maneuver Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a society full of attrition fighters, you will gain an instant advantage by converting to maneuver. Your thought process will become more fluid, more on the side of life, and you will be able to thrive off the rigid, battle-obsessed tendencies of the people around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following are the four main principles of maneuver warfare:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craft a plan with branches.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maneuver warfare depends on planning, and the plan has to be right. Too rigid, and you leave yourself no room to adjust to war’s inevitable chaos and friction; too loose and unforeseen events will confuse and overwhelm you. The perfect plan stems from a detailed analysis of the situation, which allows you to decide on the best direction to follow or the perfect position to occupy and suggests several effective options (branches) to take, depending on what the enemy throws at you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give yourself room to maneuver.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot be mobile and cannot maneuver freely if you put yourself in cramped spaces or tie yourself down to positions that do not allow you to move. Consider the ability to move and keep open more options than your enemy has as more important than holding territories or possessions. You want open space, not dead positions. This means not burdening yourself with commitments that will limit your options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give your enemy dilemmas, not problems.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of your opponents are likely to be clever and resourceful; if your maneuvers present them with a problem, they will inevitably solve it. But a dilemma is different: whatever they do, however, they respond—retreat, advance, stay still—they are still in trouble. Make every option bad: if you maneuver quickly to a point, you can force your enemies to fight before they are ready or to retreat. Try constantly to put them in positions that seem alluring but are trapped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create maximum disorder.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your enemy depends on being able to read you to get some sense of your intentions. The goal of your maneuvers should be to make that impossible, to send the enemy on a wild-goose chase for meaningless information, and to create ambiguity as to which way you will jump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you meet the dynamic situations of life with rigid plans, if you think of only holding static positions, if you rely on technology to control any friction that comes your way, you are doomed: events will change faster than you can adjust to them, and chaos will enter your system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use this strategy in the battles of daily life, letting people commit themselves to a position they can turn into a dead end. Never say you are strong; show you are by contrasting yourself and your inconsistent or moderate opponents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest power you can have in any conflict is the ability to confuse your opponent about your intentions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal of maneuver is to give you easy victories, which you do by luring opponents into leaving their fortified positions of strength for unfamiliar terrain where they must fight off balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People will always try to take from you in negotiation what they could not get from you in battle or confrontation. They will even use appeals to fairness and morality as a cover to advance their position. Do not be taken in: negotiation is about maneuvering for power or placement. It would be best if you always put yourself in a strong position that makes it impossible for the other side to nibble away at you during your talks. Before and during negotiations, you must keep advancing, creating relentless pressure and compelling the other side to settle on your terms. The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions. Create a reputation for being tough and uncompromising so that people are back on their heels before they even meet you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who believe, against the evidence, that niceness breeds niceness in return are doomed to failure in any negotiation, let alone in the game of life. People respond in a nice and conciliatory way only when it is in their interest and when they have to do so. Your goal is to create that imperative by making it painful for them to fight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes in life, you will find yourself holding the weak hand, the hand without any real leverage. At those times, it is even more important to keep advancing. By demonstrating the strength and resolve and maintaining the pressure, you cover up your weaknesses and gain footholds that will let you manufacture leverage for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt;: if you are weak and ask for little, you will get little. But if you act strong, making firm, even outrageous demands, you will create the opposite impression: people will think that your confidence must be based on something real. You will earn respect, which in turn will translate into leverage. Once you can establish yourself in a stronger position, you can take this further by refusing to compromise, making it clear that you are willing to walk away from the table—an effective form of coercion. The other side may call your bluff, but you make sure there’s a price to pay for this—bad publicity, for instance. And if, in the end, you do compromise a little, it will still be a lot less than the compromises they would have forced on you if they could.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are judged in this world by how well you bring things to an end. A messy or incomplete conclusion can reverberate for years, ruining your reputation. The art of ending things well is knowing when to stop and never going so far that you exhaust yourself or create bitter enemies that embroil you in future conflicts. It also entails ending on the right note, with energy and flair. It is not a question of simply winning the war, but how you win it and your victory set you up for the next round. The height of strategic wisdom is to avoid all conflicts and entanglements from which there are no realistic exits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst way to end anything—a war, a conflict, a relationship—is slowly and painfully. The costs of such an ending run deep: loss of self-confidence, unconscious avoidance of conflict the next time around, the bitterness and animosity left breeding—it is all an absurd waste of time. Before entering any action, you must precisely calculate your exit strategy. How exactly will the engagement end, and where will it leave you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you do find you have made this mistake, you have only two rational solutions: either end the conflict as quickly as you can, with a strong, violent blow aimed to win, accepting the costs and knowing they are better than a slow and painful death, or cut your losses and quit without delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endings in purely social relationships demand a sense of the culminating point as much as those in war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overstaying your welcome, boring people with your presence is the deepest failing: you should leave them wanting more of you, not less. You can accomplish this by bringing the conversation or encounter to an end a moment before the other side expects it. Leave too soon, and you may seem timid or rude, but do your departure right, at the peak of enjoyment and liveliness (the culminating point), and create a devastatingly positive afterglow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since defeat is inevitable, you must master the art of losing well and strategically. First, think of your mental outlook and how you absorb defeat psychologically. See it as a temporary setback, something to wake you up and teach you a lesson, and even as you lose, you end on a high note and with an edge: you are mentally prepared to go on the offensive in the next round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, you must see any defeat as a way to demonstrate something positive about yourself and your character to other people. This means standing tall, not showing signs of bitterness or becoming defensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, if you see that defeat is inevitable, it is often best to go down swinging. That way, you end on a high note even as you lose. This helps to rally the troops, giving them hope for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planting the seeds of future victory in present defeat is strategic brilliance of the highest order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dirty war is political, deceptive, and supremely manipulative. Often the last recourse of the weak and desperate, it uses any means available to level the playing field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unconventional has its logic that you must understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, nothing stays new for long. Those who depend on novelty must constantly come up with some fresh idea that goes against the orthodoxies of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, people who use unconventional methods are very hard to fight. The classic, direct route—the use of force and strength—does not work. You must use indirect methods to combat indirection, and fight fire with fire, even at the cost of going dirty yourself. To try to stay clean out of a sense of morality is to risk defeat.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since no creature can survive without the ability to see or sense what is happening around it, you must make it hard for your enemies to know what is happening around them, including what you are doing. Disturb their focus, and you weaken their strategic powers. People’s perceptions are filtered through their emotions; they tend to interpret the world according to what they want to see. Feed their expectations, manufacture a reality to match their desires, and they will fool themselves. The best deceptions are based on ambiguity, mixing fact and fiction so that one cannot be disentangled from the other. Control people’s perceptions of reality, and you control them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than likely, your concept of deception is wrong. It does not entail elaborate illusions or all sorts of showy distractions. Deception should mirror reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your false mirror must conform to people’s desires and expectations. It must incorporate visibly true things. It must seem somewhat banal, like life itself, and can have contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In essence, military deception is about subtly manipulating and distorting signs of our identity and purpose to control the enemy’s vision of reality and get them to act on their misperceptions. It is the art of managing appearances and can create a decisive advantage for whichever side uses it better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To master this art, you must embrace its necessity and find creative pleasure in manipulating appearances as if you were directing a film.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following are six main forms of military deception, each with its advantage:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The false front.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the oldest form of military deception. It originally involved making the enemy believe that one was weaker than was the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt; of weakness often brings out people’s aggressive side, making them drop strategy and prudence for an emotional and violent attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling the front you present to the world is the most critical deceptive skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best front here is weakness, which will make the other side feel superior to you so that they either ignore you (and being ignored is very valuable at times) or are baited into an aggressive action at the wrong moment. Once it is too late, once they are committed, they can find out the hard way that you are not so weak after all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the battles of daily life, making people think they are better than you are—smarter, stronger, more competent—is often wise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The decoy attack.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to this tactic is that instead of relying on words, rumours, or planted information, the army moves. It makes a concrete action. The enemy forces cannot afford to guess whether deception is in the works: if they guess wrong, the consequences are disastrous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The decoy attack is also a critical strategy in daily life, where you must retain the power to hide your intentions. To keep people from defending the points you want to attack, you must follow the military model and make real gestures toward a goal that does not interest you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions carry such weight and seem so real that people will naturally assume that is your real goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camouflage.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to blend into the environment is one of the terrifying forms of military deception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The camouflage strategy can be applied to daily life in two ways. First, blending into the social landscape is always good to avoid calling attention to yourself unless you choose to do so. When you talk and act like everyone else, mimicking their belief systems, when you blend into the crowd, you make it impossible for people to read anything particular in your behaviour. That gives you great room to move and plot without being noticed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, if you are preparing an attack of some sort and begin by blending into the environment, showing no sign of activity, your attack will seem to come out of nowhere, doubling its power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hypnotic pattern.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human beings naturally tend to think in patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This mental habit offers excellent ground for deception. Deliberately create a pattern to make your enemies believe your next action will follow true to form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planted information.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are much more likely to believe something they see with their own eyes than they are told. They are more likely to believe something they discover than something pushed at them. If you plant the false information you desire them to have—with third parties, in the neutral territory—when they pick up the clues, they have the impression they are discovering the truth. The more you can make them dig for their information, the more deeply they will delude themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how good a liar you are, it is hard to be completely natural when you deceive. You tend to try to seem natural and sincere so that it stands out and can be read. That is why it is so effective to spread your deceptions through people you keep ignorant of the truth—people who believe the lie themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadows within shadows.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deceptive maneuvers are like shadows deliberately cast: the enemy responds to them as if they were solid and real, which in and of itself is a mistake. In a sophisticated, competitive world, however, both sides know the game, and the alert enemy will not necessarily grasp at the shadow you have thrown. So you have to take the art of deception to a level higher, casting shadows within shadows, making it impossible for your enemies to distinguish between fact and fiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are trying to mislead your enemies, it is often better to concoct something ambiguous and hard to read than outright deception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By creating something that is simply ambiguous, by making everything blurry, there is no deception to uncover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be caught in deception is dangerous. If you don’t know that your cover is blown, your enemies now have more information than you do, and you become their tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always leave yourself an escape route, a cover story that can protect you if exposed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People expect your behaviour to conform to known patterns and conventions. Your task as a strategist is to upset their expectations. Surprise them and chaos and unpredictability—which they try desperately to keep at bay—enter their world. In the ensuing mental disturbance, their defences are down and they are vulnerable. First, do something ordinary and conventional to fix their image of you, then hit them with the extraordinary. The terror is greater for being so sudden. Never rely on an unorthodox strategy that worked before—it is conventional the second time around. Sometimes the ordinary is extraordinary because it is unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconventional Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconventional warfare has four main principles, as gleaned from the great practitioners of the art.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work outside the enemy’s experience.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know your enemies well, then contrive a strategy that goes outside their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfold the extraordinary out of the ordinary.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix your opponents’ expectations with some banal, ordinary maneuver, and then hit them with the extraordinary, a show of stunning force from an entirely new angle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act crazy like a fox.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon occasion, allow yourself to operate in a way that is deliberately irrational, to frighten people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an alternative, act somewhat randomly. Randomness is disturbing to humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the wheels in constant motion.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a point of breaking the habits you have developed, of acting in a way that is contrary to how you acted in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When striving to create the extraordinary, always remember: what is crucial is the mental process, not the image or maneuver itself. What will truly shock and linger long in our minds are those works and ideas that grow out of the soil of the ordinary and banal, that are unexpected, and that make us a question and contest the very nature of the reality we see around us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a political world, the cause you are fighting for must seem more just than the enemies. Think of this as moral terrain that you and the other side are fighting over; by questioning your enemies’ motives and making them appear evil, you can narrow their base of support and room to maneuver. Aim at the soft spots in their public image, exposing any hypocrisies on their part. Never assume that the justice of your cause is self-evident; publicize and promote it. When you yourself come under moral attack from a clever enemy, do not whine or get angry; fight fire with fire. If possible, position yourself as the underdog, the victim, the martyr. Learn to inflict guilt as a moral weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt;: you cannot win wars without public and political support, but people will balk at joining your side or cause unless it seems righteous and just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You quote your enemies’ own words back at them to make your attacks seem fair, almost disinterested. You create a moral taint that sticks to them like glue. Baiting them into a heavy-handed counterattack will win you even more public support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your enemies try to present themselves as more justified than you are, and therefore more moral, you must see this move for what it most often is: not a reflection of morality, of right and wrong, but a clever strategy, an exterior maneuver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can recognize an exterior maneuver in a number of ways. First, the moral attack often comes out of the left field, having nothing to do with what you imagine the conflict is about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, the attack is often ad hominem; the rational argument is met with the emotional and personal. Your character, rather than the issue you are fighting over, becomes the ground of the debate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appearances and reputation rule in today’s world; letting the enemy frame these things to its liking is akin to letting it take the most favourable position on the battlefield.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In working to spoil your enemy’s moral reputation, do not be subtle. Make your language and distinctions of good and evil as strong as possible; speak in terms of black and white. It is hard to get people to fight for a gray area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revealing your opponent’s hypocrisies is perhaps the most lethal offensive weapon in the moral arsenal: people naturally hate hypocrites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will work, however, only if the hypocrisy runs deep; it has to show up in their values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The feeling of emptiness or void—silence, isolation, nonengagement with others—is, for most people, intolerable. As a human weakness, that fear offers fertile ground for a powerful strategy: give your enemies no target to attack, be dangerous but elusive and invisible, then watch as they chase you into the void. This is the essence of guerrilla warfare. Instead of frontal battles, deliver irritating but damaging side attacks and pinprick bites. Frustrated at their inability to use their strength against your vaporous campaign, your opponents will grow irrational and exhausted. Make your guerrilla war part of a grand political cause—a people’s war—that crests in an irresistible revolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bigger your enemy, the better this strategy works: struggling to reach you, the oversize opponent presents juicy targets for you to hit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The primary consideration should always be whether a guerrilla-style campaign is appropriate for your circumstances. It is especially effective, for instance, against an opponent who is aggressive yet clever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having nothing to strike at neutralizes their cleverness, and their aggression becomes their downfall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is interesting to note that this strategy works in love and war and here, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This strategy of the void works wonders on those who are used to conventional warfare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large bureaucracies are often perfect targets for a guerrilla strategy for the same reason: they can respond only in the most orthodox manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have determined that a guerrilla war is appropriate, look at the army you will use. A large, conventional army is never suitable; fluidity and the ability to strike from many angles are what counts. The organizational model is the cell—a relatively small group of men and women, tight-knit, dedicated, self-motivated, and spread out. These cells should penetrate the enemy camp itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will win your guerrilla war in one of two ways. The first route is to increase the level of your attacks as your enemies deteriorate, then finish them off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other method is by turning sheer exhaustion to your advantage: you just let the enemy give up, for the fight is no longer worth the aggravation. The latter way is the better one. It costs you less in resources, and it looks better: the enemy has fallen on his sword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember: this war is psychological. It is more on the level of strategy than anything else that you give the enemy nothing to hold on to, nothing tangible to counter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to advance your cause with the minimum of effort and bloodshed is to create a constantly shifting network of alliances, get others to compensate for your deficiencies, do your dirty work, fight your wars, spend energy pulling you forward. The art is in choosing those allies who fit the moment’s needs and fill the gaps in your power. Give them gifts, offer them friendship, help them in time of need—all to blind them to reality and put them under subtle obligation to you. At the same time, work to sow dissension in the alliances of others, weakening your enemies by isolating them. While forming convenient coalitions, keep yourself free of negative entanglements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A common mistake is to think that the more allies we have, the better, but the quality is more important than quantity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt;: the perfect allies give you something you cannot get on your own. They have the resources you lack. They will do your dirty work for you or fight your battles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one can get far in life without allies. The trick, however, is to recognize the difference between false allies and real ones. A false alliance is created out of an immediate emotional need. It requires that you give up something essential about yourself and makes it impossible for you to make your own decisions. A true alliance is formed out of mutual self-interest, each side supplying what the other cannot get alone. It does not require you to fuse your own identity with that of a group or pay attention to everyone else’s emotional needs. It allows you autonomy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first step is to understand that all of us constantly use other people to help and advance ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no shame in this, no need to ever feel guilty. Nor should we take it personally when we realize that someone else is using us; using people is a human and social necessity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, with this understanding in mind, you must learn to make these necessary alliances strategic, aligning yourself with people who can give you something you cannot get on your own. This requires that you resist the temptation to let your decisions about alliances be governed by your emotions; your emotional needs are what your personal life is for, and you must leave them behind when you enter the arena of social battle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the best stratagems in the Alliance Game is to begin by seeming to help another person in some cause or fight, only to further your own interests in the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A variation on the Alliance Game is to play the mediator, the center around which other powers pivot. While remaining covertly autonomous, you make those around you fight for your allegiance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brilliance of this variation is that you can wield tremendous power by assuming a central position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A vital component of the Alliance Game is the ability to manipulate other people’s alliances and even destroy them, sowing dissension among your opponents so that they fight among themselves. Breaking your enemy’s alliances is as good as making alliances yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your focus here is on stirring up mistrust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life’s greatest dangers often come not from external enemies but from our supposed colleagues and friends, who pretend to work for the common cause while scheming to sabotage us and steal our ideas for their gain. Although in the court in which you serve, you must maintain the appearance of consideration and civility, you also must learn to defeat these people. Work to instill doubts and insecurities in such rivals, making them overthink and act defensively. Bait them with subtle challenges that get under their skin, triggering an overreaction, an embarrassing mistake. The victory you are after is to isolate them. Make them hang themselves through their self-destructive tendencies, leaving you blameless and clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of One-Upmanship&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout your life, you will find yourself fighting on two fronts. First is the external front, your inevitable enemies—but second and less obvious is the internal front, your colleagues and fellow courtiers, who will scheme against you, advancing their agendas at your expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt;: internal warfare is by nature unconventional. Since people theoretically on the same side usually do their best to maintain the appearance of being team players working for the greater good, complaining about them or attacking them will only make you look bad and isolate you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to adopt a form of warfare suited to these nebulous yet dangerous battles, which go on every day. And the unconventional strategy that works best in this arena is the art of one-upmanship. Developed by history’s savviest courtiers, it is based on two simple premises: first, your rivals harbour the seeds of their self-destruction, and second, a rival who is made to feel defensive and inferior, however subtly, will tend to act defensive and inferior, to his or her detriment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you sense you have colleagues who may prove dangerous—or are already plotting something—you must try first to gather intelligence on them. Look at their everyday behaviour, their past actions, and their mistakes, for signs of their flaws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin by doing something to prick the underlying wound, creating doubt, insecurity, and anxiety. It might be an offhand comment or something that your victims sense as a challenge to their position within the court. Your goal is not to challenge them blatantly, but to get under their skin: they feel attacked but are not sure why or how. The result is a vague, troubling sensation. A feeling of inferiority creeps in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You then follow up with secondary actions that feed their doubts. Here it is often best to work covertly, getting other people, the media, or simple rumors to do the job for you. The endgame is deceptively simple: having piled up enough self-doubt to trigger a reaction, you stand back and let the target self-destruct. You must avoid the temptation to gloat or get in the last blow; at this point it is best to act friendly, even offering dubious assistance and advice. Your targets’ reaction will be an overreaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The worst colleagues and comrades are often the ones with inflated egos who think everything they do is right and worthy of praise. Subtle mockery and disguised parody are brilliant ways of one-upping these types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The easiest types to one-up are those who are rigid. Being rigid does not necessarily mean being humorless or charmless, but it does mean being intolerant of anything that breaks their code of acceptable behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you seem too ambitious, you stir up resentment in other people; overt power grabs and sharp rises to the top are dangerous, creating envy, distrust, and suspicion. Often the best solution is to take small bites and swallow little territories, playing upon people’s relatively short attention spans. Stay under the radar, and they won’t see your moves. And if they do, it may already be too late; the territory is yours, a fait accompli. You can always claim you acted out of self-defence. Before people realize it, you have accumulated an empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The truth is that most people are conservative by nature. Desperate to keep what they have, they dread the unforeseen consequences and situations that conflict inevitably brings. They hate confrontation and try to avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The strategy works as follows: Suppose there is something you want or need for your security and power. Take it without discussion or warning and give your enemies a choice, either to fight or accept the loss and leave you alone. Is whatever you have taken, and your unilateral action in taking it, worth the bother, cost, and danger of waging war?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to the fait accompli strategy is to act fast and without discussion. If you reveal your intentions before taking action, you will open yourself to several criticisms, analyses, and questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the use of the piecemeal strategy to disguise your aggressive intentions is invaluable in these political times, but in masking your manipulations, you can never go too far. So when you take a bite, even a small one, make a show of acting out of self-defense. It also helps to appear as the underdog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, it would be the height of wisdom to make your bite a little larger upon occasion and then give back some of what you have taken. People see only your generosity and your limited actions, not the steadily increasing empire you are amassing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication is a kind of war, its field of battle the resistant and defensive minds of the people you want to influence. The goal is to advance, penetrate their defences and occupy their minds. Anything else is ineffective communication, and self-indulgent talk. Learn to infiltrate your ideas behind enemy lines, sending messages through little details, luring people into coming to the conclusions you desire and thinking they’ve gotten there by themselves. Some you can trick by cloaking your extraordinary ideas in ordinary forms; others, more resistant and dull, must be awoken with extreme language that bristles with newness. At all cost, avoid language that is static, preachy, and overly personal. Make your words a spark for action, not passive contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To communicate in a deep and real way, you must bring people back to their childhood, when they were less defensive and more impressed by sounds, images, actions, and a world of preverbal communication. It requires speaking a language composed of actions, all strategically designed to effect people’s moods and emotions, what they can least control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is imperative in life’s battles to be able to communicate your ideas to people, to be able to alter their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt;: you may have brilliant ideas, the kind that could revolutionize the world, but unless you can express them effectively, they will have no force, no power to enter people’s minds in a deep and lasting way. You must focus not on yourself or on the need you feel to express what you have to say but on your audience—as intently as a general focuses on the enemy he is strategizing to defeat. When dealing with people who are bored and have short attention spans, you must entertain them, sneaking your ideas in through the back door. With leaders you must be careful and indirect, perhaps using third parties to disguise the source of the ideas you are trying to spread. With the young, your expression must be more violent. In general, your words must have movement, sweeping readers along, never calling attention to their own cleverness. You are not after personal expression, but power and influence. The fewer people consciously focus on the communicative form you have chosen, the less they realize how far your dangerous ideas are burrowing into their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you need to pay attention to is not simply the content of your communication but the form—the way you lead people to the conclusions you desire rather than telling them the message in so many words. If you want people to change a bad habit, for example, much more effective than simply trying to persuade them to stop is to show them—perhaps by mirroring their bad behaviour in some way—how annoying that habit feels to other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to communicate an important idea, you must not preach; instead, make your readers or listeners connect the dots and come to a conclusion on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silence, for instance, can be used to significant effect: by keeping quiet, not responding, you say a lot; by not mentioning something that people expect you to talk about, you call attention to this ellipsis, and make it communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In putting this strategy into practice, avoid the common mistake of straining to get people’s attention by using a form that is shocking or strange. The attention you get this way will be superficial and short-lived. By using a form that alienates a wide public, you narrow your audience; you will end up preaching to the converted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even as you plan your communications to make them more consciously strategic, you must develop the reverse ability to decode the subtexts, hidden messages, and unconscious signals in what other people say. When people speak in vague generalities, for example, and use many abstract terms like justice, morality, liberty, and so on, without really ever explaining the specifics of what they are talking about, they are almost always hiding something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile people who use cutesy, colloquial language, brimming with cliches and slang, may be trying to distract you from the thinness of their ideas, trying to win you over not by the soundness of their arguments but by making you feel chummy and warm toward them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And people who use pretentious, flowery language crammed with clever metaphors are often more interested in the sound of their own voices than in reaching the audience with genuine thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A war can only be fought against an enemy who shows himself. By infiltrating your opponents’ ranks, working from within to bring them down, you give them nothing to see or react against—the ultimate advantage. You also learn their weaknesses from within and open up possibilities of sowing internal dissension. So hide your hostile intentions. To take something you want, do not fight those who have it, but rather join them—then either slowly make it your own or wait for the moment to stage a coup d’etat. No structure can stand for long when it rots from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basic principle here is that it is easiest to topple a structure—a wall, a group, a defensive mind—from the inside out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A variation on the lotus strategy is to befriend your enemies, worming your way into their hearts and minds. As your targets’ friend, you will naturally learn their needs and insecurities, the soft interior they try so hard to hide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a more immediate effect, you can try a sudden act of kindness and generosity that gets people to lower their defences—the Trojan Horse strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main weakness in any conspiracy is usually human nature: the higher the number of people in on the plot, the higher the odds that someone will reveal it, whether deliberately or accidentally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a few precautions you can take. Keep the number of conspirators as small as possible. Involve them in the details of the plot only as necessary; the less they know, the less they have to blab. Revealing the schedule of your plan as late as possible before you all act will give them no time to back out. Then, once the plan is described, stick to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too few conspirators and you lack the strength to control the consequences; too many and the conspiracy will be exposed before it bears fruit..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In destroying anything from within, you must be patient and resist the lure of large-scale, dramatic action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, morale plays a crucial part in any war, and it is always wise to work to undermine the morale of the enemy troops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always likely to be disgruntled people in your own group who will be liable to turn against you from the inside. The worst mistake is to be paranoid, suspecting one and all and trying to monitor their every move. Your only real safeguard against conspiracies and saboteurs is to keep your troops satisfied, engaged in their work, and united by their cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any attempt to bend people to your will is a form of aggression. And in a world where political considerations are paramount, the most effective form of aggression is the best-hidden one: aggression behind a compliant, even loving exterior. To follow the passive-aggressive strategy, you must seem to go along with people, offering no resistance. But actually you dominate the situation. You are noncommittal, even a little helpless, but that only means that everything revolves around you. Some people may sense what you are up to and get angry. Don’t worry—just make sure you have disguised your aggression enough that you can deny it exists. Do it right and they will feel guilty for accusing you. Passive aggression is a popular strategy; you must learn how to defend yourself against the vast legions of passive-aggressive warriors who will assail you in your daily life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We humans have a particular limitation to our reasoning powers that causes us endless problems: when we are thinking about someone or about something that has happened to us, we generally opt for the simplest, most easily digestible interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An acquaintance is good or bad, nice or mean, his or her intentions noble or nefarious; an event is positive or negative, beneficial or harmful; we are happy or sad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The truth is that nothing in life is ever so simple. People are invariably a mix of good and bad qualities, strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This tendency of ours to judge things in simple terms explains why passive aggression is so devilishly effective as a strategy and why so many people use it—consciously and unconsciously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two kinds of passive aggression. The first is conscious strategy as practiced by Metternich. The second is a semiconscious or even unconscious behavior that people use all the time in the petty and not-so-petty matters of daily life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are generally too lenient with this second variety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember&lt;/strong&gt;: it is never wise to seem too eager for power, wealth, or fame. Your ambition may carry you to the top, but you will not be liked and will find your unpopularity a problem. Better to disguise your maneuvers for power: you do not want it but have found it forced upon you. Being passive and making others come to you is a brilliant form of aggression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subtle acts of sabotage can work wonders in the passive-aggressive strategy because you can camouflage them under your friendly, compliant front.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passive aggression is so common in daily life that you have to know how to play defense as well as offense.First, you must understand why passive aggression has become so omnipresent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most often their behavior is relatively harmless: perhaps they are chronically late, or make flattering comments that hide a sarcastic sting, or offer help but never follow through. These common tactics are best ignored; just let them wash over you as part of the current of modern life, and never take them personally. You have more important battles to fight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are, however, stronger, more harmful versions of passive aggression, acts of sabotage that do real damage. A colleague is warm to your face but says things behind your back that cause you problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To defeat the passive-aggressive warrior, you must first work on yourself. This means being acutely aware of the blame-shifting tactic as it happens. Squash any feelings of guilt it might begin to make you feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, once you realize you are dealing with the dangerous variety, the smartest move is to disengage, at best to get the person out of your life, or at the least to not flare up and cause a scene, all of which plays into his hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it happens to be a partner in a relationship in which you cannot disengage, the only solution is to find a way to make the person feel comfortable in expressing any negative feelings toward you and encouraging it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most effective counterstrategy with the passive-aggressive is often to be subtle and underhanded right back at them, neutralizing their powers. You can also try this with the less harmful types—the ones who are chronically late, for instance: giving them a taste of their own medicine may open their eyes to the irritating effects of their behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terror is the ultimate way to paralyze a people’s will to resist and destroy their ability to plan a strategic response. Such power is gained through sporadic acts of violence that create a constant feeling of threat, incubating a fear that spreads throughout the public sphere. The goal in a terror campaign is not battlefield victory but causing maximum chaos and provoking the other side into desperate overreaction. Melting invisibly into the population, tailoring their actions for the mass media, the strategists of terror create the illusion that they are everywhere and,, therefore, far more powerful than they are. It is a war of nerves. The victims of terror must not succumb to fear or even anger; to plot the most effective counterstrategy, they must stay balanced. In the face of a terror campaign, one’s rationality is the last line of defence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt;: we are all extremely susceptible to the emotions of those around us. It is often hard to perceive how deeply we are affected by the moods that can pass through a group. This is what makes the use of terror so effective and so dangerous: with a few well-timed acts of violence, a handful of assassins can spark all kinds of corrosive thoughts and uncertainties. The weakest members of the target group will succumb to the greatest fear, spreading rumours and anxieties that slowly overcome the rest. The strong may respond angrily and violently to the terror campaign, but that only shows how influenced they are by the panic; they are reacting rather than strategizing—a sign of weakness, not strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although terror as a strategy can be employed by large armies and indeed whole states, it is most effectively practiced by those small in number. The reason is simple: the use of terror usually requires a willingness to kill innocent civilians in the name of the greater good and for a strategic purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being so few, they cannot hope to wage a conventional war or even a guerrilla campaign. Terror is their strategy of last resort. Taking on a much larger enemy, they are often desperate, and they have a cause to which they are utterly committed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This asymmetry brings war to its ultimate extreme: the smallest number of people waging war against an enormous power, leveraging their smallness and desperation into a potent weapon. The dilemma that all terrorism presents, and the reason it attracts so many and is so potent, is that terrorists have a great deal less to lose than the armies arrayed against them and a great deal to gain through terror.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A violent temper or outlandish act, volcanic and startling, can also create the illusion of power, disguising actual weaknesses and insecurities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have to deal with a terroristic spouse or boss, it is best to fight back in a determined but dispassionate manner—the response such types least expect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To combat terrorism—classical or the new version on the horizon—it is always tempting to resort to a military solution, fighting violence with violence, showing the enemy that your will is not broken and that any future attacks on their part will come with a heavy price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem here is that terrorists by nature, have much less to lose than you do. A counterstrike may hurt them but will not deter them; in fact, it may even embolden them and help them gain recruits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More valuable than military force here is solid intelligence, infiltration of the enemy ranks (working to find dissidents from within), and slowly and steadily drying up the money and resources on which the terrorist depends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the same time, it is important to occupy the moral high ground. As the victim of the attack, you have the advantage here, but you may lose it if you counterattack aggressively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Few ask too much from their investing – &lt;strong&gt;have high goals for your returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for stocks that professional managers like, but are not sure of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take 13F direct investing list and make that universe – take the most appealing and do deep dives to truly understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless a company that is operating in a foreign country is conducting itself so that people of that country are better off net, after the company has realised its profit, than they would be if they had nationalised it and ran it themselves, the company is living on borrowed time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is talking often more important than what is being said&lt;/strong&gt; – never forget that people whose self-interest is diametrically opposed to your own are trying to persuade you to act every day. Try to identify people whose interests correspond with yours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t have to buy small, murky stocks near the bottom to get a 100 bagger (IBM, Pfizer…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often more profitable to ignore the market and focus on stock selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More important to be right than quick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus only on multi-bagger ideas, ignore the 100% profit opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When any rule / formula substitutes thought, discard it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For new investments, must ask, “what are my chances of making 100 for one from here?”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History is of no help, only correct assumptions about the future are relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore opinions but look at assumptions, nobody knows the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The business of the stock market is to cash in on the future now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human nature one of the few constants in an ever changing world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shooting where the rabbit was is one of the most common investing errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fact without the truth is false. Always connect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical work only meant to supplement fundamental analysis – don’t rely on for when to trade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest gains in the market have been made by simultaneous increase of earnings along with increase in PE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relative multipliers measure expectations of a particular stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not let your memory trump your reason&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually people did believe twenty-five years ago that interest rates would be permanently low. Why else would they have bought long-term bonds to yield 2-1/2 percent or less? … After such a prolonged decline people who confuse memory with reasoning, as most of us do, are sure interest rates will never rise again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying power of a dollar is a measure of value, not a determinant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 categories with most 100 baggers&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advance primarily due to recovery from extremely depressed prices, rock bottom economic cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advance primarily due to change in supply-demand ratio for a basic commodity, reflected in a sharply higher commodity price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advance primarily due to great leverage in capital structure in long periods of expanding business and inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advance primarily due to the arithmetical result of reinvesting earnings at substantially higher than average rates of return on invested capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the time the need / opportunity is clear it is already reflected in the price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None sold at a high P/E when right time to buy – got earnings and multiplier gains working for them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good measure of success is calculating ratio of brokerage commission – net capital gain; both realized and unrealized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every sale should be seen as admitting an error, a missed opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most important questions to answer when investing&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much will what I expect to happen increase the status quo value of the property I am thinking of buying?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long will this take?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the present worth of the increase I expect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much of the expected value increase is already in the price I shall have to pay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there enough difference between the value increase I expect and the expected increase I have to pay for now to give me a profit I am right and a margin for error if I am wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing is cheaper or dear, except in relation to what we get for our money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What mathematics cannot do, common sense often can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The notion that cash is safe and stocks are unsafe is a fallacy. Inflation loss is real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another fallacy is that avoidance of risk is more important that seizure of opportunity. Opportunity can reward you 100 fold, risk on the other hand can only make you loose 1x of your capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as fastening a seatbelt can save your life, scrupulous attentions to the change in quality of earnings can save you your fortune&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical analysis is not an alternative to fundamental analysis, it is at most to be used as a tool for an entry and an exit after a finalised decision to buy or sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than current ratios, use statistics to back up vision and foresight. Do your research and have faith in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 3 approaches to investing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychological&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spiritual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never for a non-investment reason should one take an investment action. Such as:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My stock is too high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need the realized capital gain to offset a capital loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My stock is not moving. Others are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cannot or will not  pump up more money to meet my margin call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have already made 100 times profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if one’s information is complete and accurate, it can still be misleading investment wise if it is late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a stock persistently fails to act the way it should on the basis of the information I have, I conclude that I am missing something and redouble my efforts to find out what it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When any rule, formula, or program becomes a substitute for thought rather than an aid to thinking, it is dangerous and should be discarded.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s so important it’s worth repeating again: you need a business with a high return on capital with the ability to reinvest and earn that high return on capital for years and years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=Consider a business with $100 invested in it. Say it earns a 20 percent return on its capital in one year. A 20 percent return implies $20 in earnings. But the key to a really great idea would be a business that could then take that $20 and reinvest it alongside the original $100 and earn a 20 percent return again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway said, Over the long term, it’s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you’re not going to make much different than a 6% return—even if you originally buy it at a huge discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you’ll end up with a fine result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s not the ROE only factor because high-ROE companies can still be lousy investments .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reinvestmentconsistent-high-roeroce&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#reinvestmentconsistent-high-roeroce&quot; aria-label=&quot;reinvestmentconsistent high roeroce permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;REINVESTMENT+CONSISTENT HIGH ROE/,ROCE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would instead emphasize looking for high returns on capital and the ability to reinvest and produce high returns for years and years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we should prefer a company that can reinvest all of its earnings at a high clip. If it pays a dividend, that’s less capital&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that it has to reinvest. And that reduces the rate of return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent ROE shows management’s skill to reinvest as explained below
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say we have a business with $100 million in equity, and we make a $20 million profit. That’s a 20 percent ROE. There is no dividend. If we took that $20 million at the end of the year and just put it in the bank, we’d earn, say, 2 percent interest on that money. But the rest of the business would&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;continue to earn a 20 percent ROE. “That 20 percent ROE will actually come down to about 17 percent in the first year and then 15 percent as the cash earning a 2 percent return blends in with the business earning a 20 percent return,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So when you see a company that has an ROE of 20 percent year after year, somebody is taking the profit at the end of the year and recycling back in the business so that ROE can stay right where it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people don’t appreciate how important the ability to reinvest those profits and earn a high ROE is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason told me when he talks to management, this is the main thing he wants to talk about: How are you investing the cash the business generates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ROE doesn’t have to be a straight line. Jason used the example of Schlumberger, an oil-and-gas-services firm. He’ll use what he calls “through-the-cycle ROE.” If in an off year ROE is 10 percent, and in a good year it’s 30 percent, then that counts as a 20 percent average. “I’m comfortable buying that kind of stock,” Jason said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 reasons why going for 100  bagger not as risky as aiming for lower returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always a market for the best of anything – people will always pay up for quality&lt;/strong&gt; … That is as true of stocks and bonds as it is of real estate and antiques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying for max long-term growth avoids the pitfall of underestimating other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you buy a stock with a superior profit margin, an above-average rate of return on invested capital, and sales that are growing faster than the industry’s or the country as a whole, you have time on your side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;In real life anyone smart enough to make a better mouse trap would not stop there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t buy a stock in hope that it will change, buy if you love it the way it is&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;“Don’t marry a man to reform him,” a wise mother counselled her daughter. It is seldom profitable to marry a stock to reform it either.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to Look for multibaggers only (Dont focus momentum stocks for small gain)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, rule number one for finding 100-baggers is that you have to look for them—and that means you don’t bother playing the game for eighths and quarters, as the saying goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t waste limited mental bandwidth on stocks that might pay a good yield or that might rise 30 percent or 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only have so much time and so many resources to devote to stock research. Focus your efforts on the big game: The elephants. The 100-baggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales Growth &gt; 10%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a company with tons of cash flow but top-line [sales] growth is 5% or less, the stock doesn’t go anywhere,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason is reluctant to buy a high-ROE company where the top line isn’t at least 10 percent. But when he finds a good one, he bets big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a company generates a lot of extra sales by cutting its prices and driving down its return on equity, that may not be the kind of growth you’re looking for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes a stock grow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinvesting earnings at a constant or rising rate of return on invested capital, above the average of around 9%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing borrowed money to earn more than the cost of borrowing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquiring other companies by exchange of stock at lower P/E ratios for companies acquired than for the company acquiring them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing sales without having to increase invested capital – companies operating far below capacity, new methods, increasing efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discoveries of natural resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New inventions, processes, or formulas for filling human needs not previously met, doing essential old jobs better, faster and/or cheaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contracts to operate facilities for others, usually governments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rising P/E Ratios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to look for 100 baggers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inventions which enable us to do things we have always wanted to do but could never do before&lt;/strong&gt; (cars, airplane, TV, computer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New methods of new equipment for doing things we long have had to do but &lt;strong&gt;doing them easier, faster, or at less cost than before&lt;/strong&gt;. Computers, earth moving machinery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processes or equipment to improve or &lt;strong&gt;maintain the quality of a service&lt;/strong&gt; while reducing or eliminating the labor required to provide it (disposable syringes, frozen food, copiers  by Xerox)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New and cheaper sources of energy such as oil replacing coal, keronsne, atomic generated electricity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New methods of doing essential old jobs with less or no ecological damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved methods or equipment for recycling the materials, including water, required by civilized man instead of making mountains of waste and oceans of sewage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New methods or equipment for delivering the morning newspapers…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New methods or equipment for transporting people and goods on land without wheels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 criteria for fast growing companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small, sheer size militates against great growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relatively unknown (popular growth stocks are very likely to perform, but one has to pay for expected growth too much in advance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique product that would &lt;strong&gt;do an essential job better, cheaper, and/or faster than before, or provide a new service with prospects of great and long-continued sales increases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It must have a strong, progressive, research-minded management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know business and differentiate short term earning fluctuation from earning power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may miss 100 baggers if u dislike short term fluctuation with intact fundaments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get lost following earnings per share on a quarterly basis. Even one year may not be long enough to judge. It is more important to think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about earnings power. A company can report a fall in earnings, but its longer-term earnings power could be unaffected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earnings power – competitive strength (like pricing power) and is what really matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two most important questions in buying great companies – how high and strong is the company’s moat; how good are the prospects for sales growth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is reflected in above-average rates of return on invested capital, above-average profit margins on sales, above-average rates of sales growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the difference between earning and earning power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit Margins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RoE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RoCE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book value build up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to distinguish between short term earnings fluctuations and basic changes in earnings power accounts for much over trading, [and]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;many lost opportunities to make 100 for one in the stock market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do you separate the ephemeral (short term) earnings setback from the real thing? Well, there is no substitute for knowing the business you’ve invested in. If you don’t understand what you own, it’s impossible to make a wise choice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fundamental hasn’t changed. All that’s changed is a temporary dip in earnings because of a cyclical change in fortunes in its customer base. There is no new competitive threat. There was no management change. There is no new regulation or other factor that might change this business in any significant way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thinking I do. As you can tell, you can only do this if you know the business well. Spend less time reading economic forecasters and stock market prognosticators, and spend more time on understanding what you own. If you’re not willing to do it, then you’re not going to net a 100-bagger or anything close to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get a 100 bagger in 40 years means a CAGR of 12.2%. The rates of increase required to multiply a stock’s value by 100 in fewer years than forty are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;35 years – 14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 years – 16.6%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25 years – 20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 years – 26%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 years – 36%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you say good stock, most people think of earnings, but the company can also have assets that are earning nothing at the moment. Great assets are potential earning power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secret to success in 100 to 1 is to focus on earning power and  not price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy a good stock (earnings, good assets that people don’t think will earn) when nobody likes it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t go dumpster(rubbish container) diving if you want to turn up 100-baggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great stocks have a ready fan club, and many will spend most of their time near their 52-week highs, as you’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rare to get a truly great business at dirt-cheap prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend your time trolling stocks with price–earnings ratios of five or trading at deep discounts to book value or the like, you’re hunting in the wrong fields—at least as far as 100-baggers go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say lower multiples “preferred” because you can’t draw hard rules about any of this stuff. There are times when even 50 times earnings is a bargain. You have to balance the price you pay against other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to look at it is by using something called the PEG ratio,” Goodman suggests. “The PEG ratio is simply the (P/E Ratio)/(Annual&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPS Growth Rate). If earnings grow 20%, for example, then a P/E of 20 is justified. Anything too far above 1x could be too expensive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t overpay for growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem with 100-baggers that you don’t have to worry about the price you pay. But a simple mental experiment shows this isn’t quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly big return comes when you have both earnings growth and a rising multiple. Ideally, you’d have both working for you.I call these two factors—growth in earnings and a higher multiple on those earnings—the “twin engines” of 100-baggers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P/E at time of purchase very important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PE vs simple earnings increase&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a stock to grow 100 times on increased earnings if the PE is same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a PE grew 4x, the company would only have to increase earnings 25x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same is also a double edged sword when PE falls, in fact it is much worse as if the PE halves, the earnings have to double just to keep the prices constant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallacies in using the PE independently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings are not as easily comparable as prices. In many ways purely comparing earnings is like comparing cows vs horses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality and composition of earnings are vital in drawing effective comparisons by using the PE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just PE can be as deceptive as drinking martinis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can’t compare P/E or relative P/E between different sectors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the overwhelming number of cases, a company needs to do something well for a very long time if it is to become a 100-bagger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what signs can we look for in a business that it has what it takes to run for 20 years? This gets us to the topic of moats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A moat is what protects a business from its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;company with a moat can sustain high returns for longer than one without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a strong brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology moat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low cost production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You enjoy network effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It costs a lot to switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry barrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biggest company in small market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for financial statements. Specifically, the higher the gross margin relative to the competitiors, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moat, even a narrow moat, is a necessity for 100 baggers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is vitally important that the high rate of return be protected by a “gate” making entry into the business difficult if not impossible. .. Just be sure the gate is strong and high.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;smaller-companies-preferred7000-cr&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#smaller-companies-preferred7000-cr&quot; aria-label=&quot;smaller companies preferred7000 cr permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;SMALLER COMPANIES PREFERRED(&amp;#x3C;7000 cr)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median sales of 100 baggers companies @ $170 million(1200cr)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you shouldn’t assume you need to dive into microcaps and buy 25-cent stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not like you have to search microcaps for 100 baggers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, I suggest focusing on companies with market caps of less than $1 billion (&amp;#x3C;7000cr mcap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a necessity (remember, smaller companies “preferred”), but staying below such a deck will make for a more fruitful search than staying above it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small companies can grow to 10 times or 20 times and still be small. They can even become 100-baggers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must consider future size / revenues of potential 100 bagger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% compounded over 50 years, a company must be 9,100 times as big at the end of the period as at the beginning
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you project that kind of growth for a company with $100 million of annual sales in 1980s, you must expect those sales to reach $910 billion annually by 2021.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must evaluate the competitive status of the company not as it is today but as it will be six to eight years from now, when it is three or four times bigger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large factor is also the current size of the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you pay for a stock you are not only paying for average growth, but more importantly for superior growth over the future. Therefore you have to evaluate the company in a size 5-6 times its current size, after 6-8 years and check if it still makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-priced stocks, like the poor, are always with us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;management&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#management&quot; aria-label=&quot;management permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;MANAGEMENT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the ultimate analysis, it is the management alone which is the 100x alchemist,” they concluded. “And it is to those who have mastered the art of evaluating the alchemist that the stock market rewards with gold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing with top entrepreneurs and owner-operators gives you a big edge. And when you mix that talent with the other elements, you are on your way to big returns, if not 100-baggerdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;investing with companies that have high insider ownership. I think it brings the alignment with shareholders closer together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic economic principals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All market value is in the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All laws made by men, can be changed by men, will be changed by men as soon as people decide that they would be better off if the laws are changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one’s title or right to property is worth anymore than his fellow creatures willingness to defend it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a company seems to be operating in ignorance or defiance of these 3 principles, don’t stop and figure – RUN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself if the company you plan to invest into is going to make the world a better place. If no, avoid it like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical approach – never do business unless trust the other party. Is the company really improving people’s lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like attracts like, easy to “dress up a pig”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know-how is a competition reducer – the longer it takes to learn how to do what your company is doing, the fewer competitors will be around to do it for less. Diligence and integrity also vital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware egonomics and an aging business getting comfortable / complacent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral cancer thus introduced cannot be extirpated simply by removing the evil genius at the top. It may take a generation under a good management to purge the organization of the unprincipled sharp-shooter brought in by a bad management. Hence it is unwise to look for a quick turnaround in an organization whose management has demonstrated a lack of moral principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;investing more and more is just a people business and that management is critically important for a couple of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of my favorite Buffett quotes is the one where he talks about a CEO who is on a job for 10 years and he’s allocating 10% of the profits so whatever, it comes to an enormous number that that CEO is responsible for allocating that capital. That’s very important and has a big impact on returns. The honesty of management, if there’s any question about management, if there’s anything in their history that gives you pause, I would not mess with it because the market’s always going to test you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management’s definitely very, very important. I spent a lot of time trying to evaluate the track record there and the integrity of the people involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families are generally a positive when there’s large family ownership in the business. There’s empirical research on this too that families, in general, are good stewards of capital because they tend to be less levered and less aggressive. They are more willing to invest long-term and not play the quarterly earnings game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of times in broader history, families transitions don’t really go so well but there are always exceptions. For example, John Elkann of Exor, who has shown he’s a pretty good capital allocator, a pretty good manager, and he was groomed for that role very young. I think that’s one way to look at it is to say, “Has this person been involved in the business when they were very young? What kind of training did they receive?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how did they treat minority shareholders in the past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You invest your money in the same securities the people who control the business own. What’s good for them is good for you. And vice versa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say the best thing to do is invest with management teams that own a lot of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with their own wealth at risk make better decisions as a group than those who are hired guns. The end result is that shareholders do better with these owner-operated firms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, I relied on reported numbers and I screened for statistical cheapness. I’d look for low P/E stocks, for example.Everyone can see these numbers. Yet, these methods can still work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, however, I’ve learned that knowing what the numbers don’t show is worth more than any statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas can come from anywhere. But my best ideas often come from people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hidden stories exist. And there is a person, somewhere, who knows that story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make an effort to find those people and their stories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bet on individuals and organisations fired by the zeal to meet human wants and needs, imbued with enthusiasm over solving mankind’s problems. Not just ones that are there for the profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate economist thinks of making the company bigger than more profitable. When you see a company delivering a low return on capital and continuing capital expenditure year on year to improve market share – you probably are dealing with a corporate economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually the market pays what you might call an entertainment tax, a premium, for stocks with an exciting story. So boring stocks sell at a discount. Buy enough of them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AVOID HOT SECTORS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid the hot sectors of whatever market you’re in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That’s where promoters and shysters go because that’s where they can get the biggest bang for the buck. The sector is rife with fraud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO ENOUGH RESEARCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When someone tells me they can’t find anything worth buying in this market, they are just not looking hard enough. With 10,000 securities today, even one-half of 1 percent is 50 names. Kind of makes you think, doesn’t it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIMPLEST IS BEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best ideas are often the simplest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of a stock varies inversely with the thickness of its research file. The fattest files are found in stocks that are the most troublesome and will decline the furthest. The thinnest files are reserved for those that appreciate the most&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Lynch comes to mind: “Never invest in any idea you can’t illustrate with a crayon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIVERSIFICATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever study u have done, sometime luck may be against you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So diversify in 10 to 20 stocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being right too soon just as painful as being wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excessive diversification dodges rather than solves the investment problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONT CHASE RETURNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t try to chase returns, because doing so will cost you a lot of money over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There really isn’t anything intelligent to say about returns over months or year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides, who cares about one year? You have to play the long game… There are approaches and investors who have beaten the market by a solid margin over time… The thing is, they seldom beat the market consistently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best investors lag the market 30–40 percent of the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None in the superstar investor group always beat the S&amp;#x26;P 500 probably because no one thought that was the primary objective.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I say, there are ways to beat the market over time. But none of these approaches always beats the market. Even the best lag it, and often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an individual, though, you have a great advantage in that you can ignore the benchmark chasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep that in mind before you reshuffle your portfolio after looking at year-end results. Don’t chase returns! And don’t measure yourself against the S&amp;#x26;P 500 or any other benchmark. Just focus on trying to buy right and hold on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest like a Dealmaker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people chase returns. As an example, consider one of my favorite studies of all time, by Dalbar. It showed that the average mutual fund earned a return of 13.8 percent per year over the length of the study. Yet the average investor in those funds earned just 7 percent. Why? Because they took their money out after funds did poorly and put it back in after they had done well. Investors were constantly chasing returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO IGNORE FORECASTERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One large study covered nearly 95,000 consensus estimates from more than two decades. It found the average estimate was off by more than 40 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Dreman writes about this in his book Contrarian Investment Strategies. Digging deeper, he finds the analysts made consistent errors in one direction: they were too optimistic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So if you put the two together, you quickly come to realize the odds of you owning a stock that doesn’t suffer a negative earnings surprise is pretty small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people spend a great deal of time trying to guess where the economy or the stock market is going. And yet, there are countless studies that show the folly of such forecasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have missed every recession in the last four decades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IGNORE MACRO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a world of noise out there. The financial media is particularly bad. Every day, something important happens, or so they would have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They narrate every twist in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cover every Fed meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They document the endless stream of economic data and reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They give a platform for an unending parade of pundits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody wants to try to call the market, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They predict where interest rates will go or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They predict the price of oil or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARKET CRASH-HUGE OPPORTUNITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2008 like disasters create “easier” opportunities to make hundredfold returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;avoid companies with lots of debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;avoid companies that are really deeply cyclical. I’m not going to be interested in say mining companies, or I’m not going to spend a lot of time looking at tanker stocks, or these heavy industrial, very cyclical names where you look at their performance over the last 10 years. I’m not going to invest in say little biotech names with one or two drugs,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a skill set in that area so that’s easy to kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of businesses that are not really that good they’re just mediocre. When you see businesses their return on assets is low single digits, the only way they get into a double-digit return on equity is they’re using a lot of debt. Businesses that don’t really have much of competitive advantage for there are lots of competitors and it’s nothing particularly special about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if there’s any whiff of that there might be some fraud or any whiff that there are accounting issues, I stay away from those, overly complicated things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I’ve been reluctant to get involved with roll-ups, where these companies do a lot of acquisitions but I’ve changed that recently. As I wrote down the blog, there are some companies that have been very skilled at acquiring lots of companies, Constellation Software is one that I’ve written about I do not own. HEICO, of course, is another skill acquired. Brown &amp;#x26; Brown is an insurance broker that I own, has proven to be a very good acquisition over a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check if a company is earning a pretty stable return on invested capital over that time (last 10 years), or look at some return metrics ROA, ROE, ROI, CEOs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies constantly writing down those acquisitions and three or four years later, they’re writing them down. This company is probably not doing a good job on acquisitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company that’s doing a lot of acquisitions and over time you see slow degradation in returns on capital, that would also be a sign that they’re not doing such a good job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if a full position is something around eight or nine or 10. Say between eight and nine. Then I might start something around three or four and then quickly get it to three or four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some money managers who just like to even take very small positions maybe 1% or 2% just because they know that now they own it, it raises their awareness to another level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dividends&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#dividends&quot; aria-label=&quot;dividends permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;DIVIDENDS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t scoff at dividends when you are looking at capital gains as, the route through highest capital gains is often though valuation based on dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a company pays a dividend, it has that much less capital to reinvest. Instead, you have it in your pocket—after paying taxes. Ideally, you want to find a company that can reinvest those dollars at a high rate of ROE . You wind up with a bigger pile at the end of the day and pay less in taxes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the company had paid dividends, the story would be quite different. Say it paid out one-third of its earnings. It would then take 15 years to quadruple its capital, not 10. And in 33 years, it would be up 23-fold, instead of being a 100-bagger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously,” Phelps concludes, “dividends are an expensive luxury for an investor seeking maximum growth. If you must have income, don’t expect your financial doctor to match the capital gains that might have been obtainable without dividends. When you buy a cow to milk, don’t plan to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;race her against your neighbor’s horse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;buyback&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#buyback&quot; aria-label=&quot;buyback permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BUYBACK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a company that drives its shares outstanding lower over time and seems to have a knack for buying at good prices, you should take a deeper look. You may have found a candidate for a 100-bagger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a slow- to no-growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;economy, this tactic is becoming a more important driver of earnings-per share growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buyback criteria
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company should have available funds—cash plus sensible borrowing capacity—beyond the near-term needs of the business and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second, finds its stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value, conservatively calculated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hold-stock-for-long-term&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#hold-stock-for-long-term&quot; aria-label=&quot;hold stock for long term permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;HOLD STOCK FOR LONG TERM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To net a 100-bagger, you need to hang onto a quality stock for a number of years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more likely journey will take 20–25 years for 100 baggers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you buy a stock that returns about 20 percent annually for 25 years, you’ll get your 100-bagger. But if you sell in year 20, you’ll get “only”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about 40 to 1—before taxes. The last five years will more than double your overall return (assuming the annual return is constant). So, you must wait.
This is not to discourage you. You can earn great returns in less than 20 years. But I want to get you to think big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY BUT DONT FORGET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phleps do not recommend putting them away and forgetting them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter lynch also recommends holding stocks until fundaments deteriorate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check your investment thesis at regular interval&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you don’t get a hundredfold return? The point of Phelps’s brilliant teaching method is to focus your attention on the power of compounding until fundaments are intact. After all, even if you catch part of a 100-bagger, the returns could fund a retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy right and hold on does not equal buy and forget – eternal vigilance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time is an often overlooked element in value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investor, dedicated to buying right and holding on, picks managements, products, and processes he thinks able to cope with the unforeseeable as it hoves into view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except to learn from experience, one should never waste time looking back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortunes are made by buying right and holding on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay with your most successful stock investments as long as the companies are increasing their earnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVERYMAN’S APPROACH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JUST HOLD ON GOOD QUALITY STOCKS IS EVERYMAN’S REPLICABLE APPROACH .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very few people are successful traders while there is long list of successful investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the markets, you can find all kinds of crazy success stories, such as the improbable traders of Market Wizards fame—including Jim Rogers,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Tudor Jones and Michael Steinhardt—. These never interested me, for many reasons, but one big reason is they struck me as freakish. The gains were enormous, but the process was not replicable—certainly not by the everyman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve also seen how ordinary people can achieve the lofty returns of 100-bagger dom by simply holding onto good stocks. You don’t have to have an MBA or work at a hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems so simple, but few actually ever achieve it by holding for years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make money in stocks, you need to have vision to see them, courage to buy them and patience to hold them. Patience is the rarest of the three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGEST VOLATILITY (UPS N DOWNS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest hurdle to making 100 times your money in a stock—or even just tripling it—may be the ability to stomach the ups and downs and hold on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem isn’t only that we’re impatient. It’s that the ride is not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;often easy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, which has been a 60-bagger since 2002, lost 25 percent of its value in a single day—four times! On its worst day, it fell 41 percent. And there was a four-month stretch where it dropped 80 percent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple from its IPO in 1980 through 2012 was a 225-bagger. But… Those who held on had to suffer through a peak-to-trough loss of 80 percent—twice! The big move from 2008 came after a 60 percent drawdown. And there were several 40 percent drops. Many big winners suffered similar awful losses along the way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COFFEE CAN PORTFOLIO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You take some portion of your money and create a “coffee-can portfolio.” What you put in it, you commit to holding for 10 years. That’s it. At the end of 10 years, you see what you have. Coffee-can experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says you will have found at least one big winner in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, investing in the buy-and-hold manner means sometimes you will be hit with a nasty loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But that is why you own a portfolio of stocks. To me, investing in stocks is interesting only because you can make so much on a single stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee-can theory says you’ll have done better this way than if you had tried to more actively manage your stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing this, you need to find a way to defeat your own worst instincts—the impatience, the need for “action,” the powerful feeling that you need to “do something.” To defeat this baleful tendency, I offer you the coffee can as a crutch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portfolio construction with maybe 10 to 12 names somewhere between 8% and 10% each on cost.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no more than 10% of the portfolio in any one position on a cost basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid to have too many connected positions for example just one hotel company or 1 oil company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you really find one that’s a winner and you have to cut back on it, that’s a good problem to have. But ideally, I think you just let it ride as long as everything is in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes worth selling to get into a better stock but after taxes, etc. it has to be much, much better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU SHOULD BE RELUCTANT SELLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are hunting for 100-baggers, you must learn to sit on your ass. Buy right and sit tight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when to sell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, Phil Fisher had a chapter called “When to Sell.” …If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is—almost never.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even Fisher allows three and only three reasons to sell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve made a mistake in original purchase&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock no longer meets your investment criteria(change in fundaments)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better opportunity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching is treacherous .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every stock that’s moving looks better than the one you’re thinking of selling. And there are always stocks that are moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors too bite on what’s moving and can’t sit on a stock that isn’t going anywhere. They also lose patience with one that is moving against them. This causes them to make a lot of trades and never enjoy truly mammoth returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary “If you’ve done the job right and bought a stock only after careful study, then you should be a reluctant seller”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONT SELL WHEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock price is not indication for reason to sell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STOCK IS TOO HIGH OR HIGH PE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During periods of rapid share price appreciation, stock prices can reach lofty P/E ratios. This shouldn’t necessarily discourage one from continuing to hold the stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STOCK HAS FALLEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monster Beverage became a 100-bagger in 10 years, …I count at least 10 different occasions where it fell more than 25 percent during that run. In three separate months, it lost more than 40 percent of its value. Yet if you focused on the business—and not the stock price—you would never have sold. And if you put $10,000 in that stock, you would have $1 million at the end of 10 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STOCK IS GOING NO WEHERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes stocks take a long time to get going. Phelps had plenty of examples of stocks that went nowhere (or down) for years but still delivered the big 100 to 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;timing-market&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#timing-market&quot; aria-label=&quot;timing market permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;TIMING MARKET&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lynch has taught us - ‘’Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phelps also stands against market timing. He told me about how&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he predicted various bear markets in his career. “Yet I would have been
much better off if instead of correctly forecasting a bear market, I had focused my attention through the decline on finding stocks that would turn $10,000 into a million dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of his bearishness, he missed opportunities that went on to deliver 100 to 1. “Bear market smoke gets in one’s eyes,” he said, and it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blinds us to buying opportunities if we are too intent on market timing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing not too important if find the right company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MANAGEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading conference-call transcripts is better than listening to them(visiting them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, it is “best to keep management at a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Boards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boards are supposed to represent shareholders, but they don’t. As Block said, there is a symbiotic relationship with CEOs. Board members often view their directorship as a perk, not a responsibility. Insurance and other protections insulate boards from liability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, board investigations into misdeeds are unreliable. When boards have to investigate something, it’s like asking them to admit their own incompetence, Block said. You can’t rely on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lawyers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawyers “make it difficult for investors to make good decisions.” They represent the interests of their clients—the people who pay them—not investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“‘Prestigious’ law firms are a surprisingly effective fig leaf,” Block said. They are great at writing indecipherable prose. And the attorney–client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;privilege “hides innumerable acts of corporate wrongdoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auditors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Auditors are completely misunderstood,” Block said. Again, they represent the interest of their clients—the people who pay them. I’m reminded of the old saying “Whose bread I eat, his song I sing.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block talked about how it is a profession that rewards failure. Negative audits often lead to lifetime employment because the firm is fearful of being sued and wants the auditor around to help get it out of any messes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, Block said, accounting is “a profession fighting against accountability and transparency. They [the big auditing firms] fight disclosures repeatedly. They do not want to provide investors with a better window into audits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Banks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously, the investment banks have an incentive to sell financial products—stocks, bonds, and so on. They are not looking out for your interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t know this by now, here it is: don’t look to research put out by investment banks or brokerage houses as a source of advice on where you should invest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market-Research Firms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This one was interesting because you often see “market research” quoted from the likes of Frost &amp;#x26; Sullivan and iResearch. Block said companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hire these firms and often give them the research to get the report they want. Market research is there to add legitimacy to management’s claims. It’s not to help you make a good decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distrust market research. Look for more objective sources of information, such as actual sales data and trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market cap below 500 mil$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales growth 15% +&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPS growth 15%+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PEG below 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insider ownership 10%+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROE this year 20%+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average ROE past 5 years 20%+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past 5 years: ROE not below 15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biotech and financials excluded&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make money in stocks, you need to have vision to see them, courage to buy them and patience to hold them. Patience is the rarest of the three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more money can be made by good stock selection, than by good market timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem, well-defined is half solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What one buys in the stock market is 3/4 times more important that when one buys in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best safeguard against the sleigh of hand booking keeping is to have nothing to do with it or with the men who practise it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no civilisation has the value of currency increased, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt is never bad. What one does with it determines the goodness or the badness of the debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alice in Wonderland one had to run fast to stand still, in the stock markets, one who stands still can really make money fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not one in a thousand seriously plans and acts as one must to make a fortune&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be dismayed by a loss. Recognize it as one of the costs without which you could not have net gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if one’s information is complete and accurate, it can still be misleading investment wise if it is late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying right will do you little good unless you hold on. But holding on will do you little good – and may do you great harm – unless you have bought right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a stock persistently fails to act the way it should on the basis of the information I have, I conclude that I am missing something and redouble my efforts to find out what it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral cancer thus introduced cannot be extirpated simply by removing the evil genius at the top. It may take a generation under a good management to purge the organization of the unprincipled sharp-shooter brought in by a bad management. Hence it is unwise to look for a quick turnaround in an organization whose management has demonstrated a lack of moral principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits are the reward of human spirit and high endeavor – of great leadership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical question is not whether we should have inflation or not but how much, how fast. What does this mean to common stocks? The short answer is that inflation makes stocks rise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When any rule, formula, or program becomes a substitute for thought rather than an aid to thinking, it is dangerous and should be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much can never be foreseen or even imagined. The one way to benefit by it is to buy the best stock or stocks you can with no intention of selling them until they turn bad. If history is any guide, some will end up in your high bracket estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To buy right requires vision and courage – faith that is evidence of things not seen, things not susceptible to mathematical proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the stock market is a market of second-hand goods. The only reason you’re able to buy a share in a company is because somebody else didn’t want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t feel good because it’s up, and you can’t feel bad because it’s down. You just have to focus on the business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t really matter that much about the industry or the sector because when I did that 100-bagger research, that was one of the things that surprised me was the number of prosaic businesses that you wouldn’t necessarily expect was on there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rationality is logical coherence—reasonable or not. Econs are rational by this definition, but there is overwhelming evidence that Humans cannot be. An Econ would not be susceptible to priming, WYSIATI, narrow framing, the inside view, or preference reversals, which Humans cannot consistently avoid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The definition of rationality as coherence is impossibly restrictive; it demands adherence to rules of logic that a finite mind is not able to implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assumption that agents are rational provides the intellectual foundation for the libertarian approach to public policy: do not interfere with the individual’s right to choose, unless the choices harm others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thaler and Sunstein advocate a position of libertarian paternalism, in which the state and other institutions are allowed to nudge people to make decisions that serve their own long-term interests. The designation of joining a pension plan as the default option is an example of a nudge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can be done about biases? How can we improve judgments and decisions, both our own and those of the institutions that we serve and that serve us? The short answer is that little can be achieved without a considerable investment of effort. As I know from experience, System 1 is not readily educable. Except for some effects that I attribute mostly to age, my intuitive thinking is just as prone to overconfidence, extreme predictions, and the planning fallacy as it was before I made a study of these issues. I have improved only in my ability to recognize situations in which errors are likely: “This number will be an anchor…,” “The decision could change if the problem is reframed…” And I have made much more progress in recognizing the errors of others than my own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way to block errors that originate in System 1 is simple in principle: recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down, and ask for reinforcement from System 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizations are better than individuals when it comes to avoiding errors, because they naturally think more slowly and have the power to impose orderly procedures. Organizations can institute and enforce the application of useful checklists, as well as more elaborate exercises, such as reference-class forecasting and the premortem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least in part by providing a distinctive vocabulary, organizations can also encourage a culture in which people watch out for one another as they approach minefields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The corresponding stages in the production of decisions are the framing of the problem that is to be solved, the collection of relevant information leading to a decision, and reflection and review. An organization that seeks to improve its decision product should routinely look for efficiency improvements at each of these stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is much to be done to improve decision making. One example out of many is the remarkable absence of systematic training for the essential skill of conducting efficient meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately, a richer language is essential to the skill of constructive criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision makers are sometimes better able to imagine the voices of present gossipers and future critics than to hear the hesitant voice of their own doubts. They will make better choices when they trust their critics to be sophisticated and fair, and when they expect their decision to be judged by how it was made, not only by how it turned out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Characters of the Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System 1 (&lt;strong&gt;fast thinker&lt;/strong&gt;) operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System 2 (&lt;strong&gt;slow thinker&lt;/strong&gt;) allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I describe System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 generate surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rough order of complexity, here are some examples of the automatic activities that are attributed to System 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect that one object is more distant than another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orient to the source of a sudden sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly diverse operations of System 2 have one feature in common: they require attention and are disrupted when attention is drawn away. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count the occurrences of the letter a in a page of text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the validity of a complex logical argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the mark of effortful activities that they interfere with each other, which is why it is difficult or impossible to conduct several at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the tasks of System 2 is to overcome the impulses of System 1. In other words, System 2 is in charge of self-control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention and Effort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People, when engaged in a mental sprint, become effectively blind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes. Talent has similar effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the significant discoveries of cognitive psychologists in recent decades is that switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work. Several psychological studies have shown that people who are simultaneously challenged by a demanding cognitive task and by a temptation are more likely to yield to the temptation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations. A few drinks have the same effect, as does a sleepless night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baumeister’s group has repeatedly found that an effort of will or self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. The phenomenon has been named ego depletion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The evidence is persuasive: activities that impose high demands on System 2 require self-control, and the exertion of self-control is depleting and unpleasant. Unlike cognitive load, ego depletion is at least in part a loss of motivation. After exerting self-control in one task, you do not feel like making an effort in another, although you could do it if you really had to. In several experiments, people were able to resist the effects of ego depletion when given a strong incentive to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restoring glucose levels can have a counteracting effect to mental depletion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priming effects take many forms. If the idea of EAT is currently on your mind (whether or not you are conscious of it), you will be quicker than usual to recognize the word SOUP when it is spoken in a whisper or presented in a blurry font. And of course you are primed not only for the idea of soup but also for a multitude of food-related ideas, including fork, hungry, fat, diet, and cookie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priming is not limited to concepts and words; your actions and emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware, including simple gestures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money seems to prime individualism: reluctance to be involved with, depend on, or accept demands from others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: the effects of primes are robust but not necessarily large; likely only a few in a hundred voters will be affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priming happens when exposure to one idea makes you more likely to favor related ones.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, when asked to complete the word fragment SO_P, people primed with ‘eat’ will usually complete SOUP. Meanwhile, people primed with ‘wash’ will usually complete SOAP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System 1 helps us make quick connections between causes and effects, things and their properties, and categories&lt;/strong&gt;. By priming us (i.e., “pre-fetching” information based on recent stimuli and pre-existing associations) System 1 helps us make rapid sense of the infinite network of ideas that fills our sensory world, without having to analyze everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priming usually works because the most familiar answer is also the most likely. But priming causes issues when System 2 leans on these associations inappropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of considering all options equally, System 1 gives ‘primed’ associations priority instead of relying on facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive ease: no threats, no major news, no need to redirect attention or mobilize effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive strain: affected by both the current level of effort and the presence of unmet demands; requires increased mobilization of System 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories and thinking are subject to illusions, just as the eyes are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictable illusions inevitable occur if a judgement is based on an impression of cognitive ease or strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make recipients believe something, general principle is to ease cognitive strain: make font legible, use high-quality paper to maximize contrasts, print in bright colours, use simple language, put things in verse (make them memorable), and if you quote, make sure it’s an easy name to pronounce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weird example: stocks with pronounceable tickers do better over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mood also affects performance: happy moods dramatically improve accuracy. Good mood, intuition, creativity, gullibility and increased reliance on System 1 form a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other pole, sadness, vigilance, suspicion, an analytic approach, and increased effort also go together. A happy mood loosens the control of System 2 over performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Ease describes how hard we think a mental task is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It increases if the information is clear, simple, and repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biases happen when complex information (requiring System 2) is presented in ways that make problems look easier than they really are (falling back on System 1).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, researchers gave students the following puzzle: “A bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The question is not straightforward and needs System 2 to engage. But researchers found that System 1 often responds with an intuitive, incorrect answer of 10 cents (correct = 5 cents).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, when the students saw the question in a less legible font, cognitive ease decreased. Far fewer made the error because System 2 was more likely to engage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we try to conserve mental energy, if cognitive ease is high, and our brain thinks it can solve a problem with System 1, it will not switch to System 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Advertising has long used this technique to persuade people to make instinctive purchase decisions. A good mood can also fool us into a state of cognitive ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Norms, Surprises, and Causes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can detect departures from the norm (even small ones) within two-tenths of a second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make sense of the world we tell ourselves stories about what’s going on. We make associations between events, circumstances, and regular occurrences. The more these events fit into our stories the more normal they seem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things that don’t occur as expected take us by surprise. To fit those surprises into our world we tell ourselves new stories to make them fit. We say, “Everything happens for a purpose,” “God did it,” “That person acted out of character,” or “That was so weird it can’t be random chance.” Abnormalities, anomalies, and incongruities in daily living beg for coherent explanations. Often those explanations involve 1) assuming intention, “It was meant to happen,” 2) causality, “They’re homeless because they’re lazy,” or 3) interpreting providence, “There’s a divine purpose in everything.” “We are evidently ready from birth to have impressions of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation,” (page 76). “Your mind is ready and even eager to identify agents, assign them personality traits and specific intentions, and view their actions as expressing individual propensities,” (page 76). Potential for error? We posit intention and agency where none exists, we confuse causality with correlation, and we make more out of coincidences than is statistically warranted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System 1 uses norms to maintain our model of the world, and constantly updates them&lt;/strong&gt;. They tell us what to expect in a given context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprises should trigger the activation of System 2 because they are outside of these models. But if new information is presented in familiar contexts or patterns, System 1 can fail to detect this and fall back on old ‘norms’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, when asked “How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?”, many people immediately answer “two”. They do not recognize what is wrong because the words fit the norm of a familiar biblical context (but Moses ≠ Noah).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to create new norms appropriately causes us to construct stories that explain situations and ‘fill in the gaps’ based on our existing beliefs. This leads to false explanations for coincidences, or events with no correlation (also known as ‘narrative fallacy’).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The halo effect is confirmation bias towards people. It’s why first impressions count.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one study, experimenters gave people lists of traits for fictitious characters and found that participants’ overall views changed significantly just based on the order of the traits (positive or negative first).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The halo effect also stretches to unseen attributes that are unknowable and unrelated to the initial interaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, friendly people are also considered more likely to donate to charity and tall people are perceived as more competent (which may help explain the unexpectedly high number of tall CEOs in the world’s largest companies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System 1 struggles to account for the possibility that contradictory information may exist that we cannot see. It operates on the principle that “what you see is what you get”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you like the president’s politics, you probably like his voice and his appearance as well. The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person—including things you have not observed—is known as the halo effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To counter, you should decor relate error - in other words, to get useful information from multiple sources, make sure these sources are independent, then compare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The principle of independent judgments (and decorrelated errors) has immediate applications for the conduct of meetings, an activity in which executives in organizations spend a great deal of their working days. A simple rule can help: before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmation bias is our tendency to favor facts that support our existing conclusions and unconsciously seek evidence that aligns with them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our conclusions can come from existing beliefs or values, or System 1 norms. They can also come from an idea provided to us as a System1 prime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, if we believe that “Republicans are out to destroy our way of life”, we’ll subconsciously pay more attention and give more credit to evidence that confirms that belief while dismissing evidence that contradicts it. (And vice versa for Democrats.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confirmation bias affirms System 1 norms and priming. System 1 tends to prioritise evidence that supports pre-existing ideas. It will also discount evidence that contradicts them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The operations of associative memory contribute to a general confirmation bias. When asked, “Is Sam friendly?” different instances of Sam’s behavior will come to mind than would if you had been asked “Is Sam unfriendly?” A deliberate search for confirming evidence, known as positive test strategy, is also how System 2 tests a hypothesis. Contrary to the rules of philosophers of science, who advise testing hypotheses by trying to refute them, people (and scientists, quite often) seek data that are likely to be compatible with the beliefs they currently hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;intuitive-judgments&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#intuitive-judgments&quot; aria-label=&quot;intuitive judgments permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;intuitive judgments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System 1 helps us make quick, sometimes life-saving judgements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an evolutionary sense, this helped us scan for and avoid threats. But System 1 also has blind spots that can lead to poor analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;strong&gt;System 1 is good at assessing averages but very poor at determining cumulative effects&lt;/strong&gt;. When shown lines of different lengths, it is very easy for people to estimate the average length. It is very difficult for them to estimate the total length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System 1 also can’t “forget” matches that have nothing to do with the question and interfere with the answer&lt;/strong&gt;. In one study participants were given a story about a particularly gifted child. Most readily answered the question “How tall is a man who is as tall as the child was clever?” even though there is no logical way of estimating the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitive assessments can be so strong they override our thought process even when we know System 2 should be making the decision. For example, when voters base their decision on candidates’ photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What You See is All There is (WYSIATI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The measure of success for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create. The amount and quality of the data on which the story is based are largely irrelevant. When information is scarce, which is a common occurrence, System 1 operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WYSIATI: What you see is all there is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WYSIATI helps explain some biases of judgement and choice, including:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overconfidence&lt;/strong&gt;: As the WYSIATI rule implies, neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Framing effects&lt;/strong&gt;: Different ways of presenting the same information often evoke different emotions. The statement that the odds of survival one month after surgery are 90% is more reassuring than the equivalent statement that mortality within one month of surgery is 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base-rate neglect&lt;/strong&gt;: Recall Steve, the meek and tidy soul who is often believed to be a librarian. The personality description is salient and vivid, and although you surely know that there are more male farmers than male librarians, that statistical fact almost certainly did not come to your mind when you first considered the question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We often generate intuitive opinions on complex matters by substituting the target question with a related question that is easier to answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The present state of mind affects how people evaluate their happiness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;affect heuristic: in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world. Your political preference determines the arguments that you find compelling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you like the current health policy, you believe its benefits are substantial and its costs more manageable than the costs of alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substitution is what happens when we conserve mental energy by replacing difficult questions with easier, related questions&lt;/strong&gt;. This makes System 1 respond with a ‘mental shotgun’, and we fail to recognize that System 2 should be analyzing the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, “How popular will the president be six months from now?” is substituted with “How popular is the president right now?” System 1 recalls the answer to the easier question with more cognitive ease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substitution happens more often when we’re emotional. For example, “How much would you contribute to save an endangered species?” is replaced with “How much emotion do you feel when you think of dying dolphins?”. System 1 matches giving money with the strength of emotion, even though the two are not directly related.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A random event, by definition, does not lend itself to explanation, but collections of random events do behave in a highly regular fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large samples are more precise than small samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small samples yield extreme results more often than large samples do.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The strong bias toward believing that small samples closely resemble the population from which they are drawn is also part of a larger story: we are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cause and Chance
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our predilection for causal thinking exposes us to serious mistakes in evaluating the randomness of truly random events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The law of small numbers is when System 1 tries to explain results that are an effect of statistically small samples&lt;/strong&gt;. This leads to System 1 inventing stories, connections and causal links that don’t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, a study found that rural areas have both the lowest and highest rates of kidney cancer. This provoked theories about why small populations cause or prevent cancer, even though there is no link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System 1 also tries to explain random results that appear to have a pattern. For example, in a sequence of coin toss results, TTTT is just as likely as TTTH. But the pattern in the first set triggers a search for a reason more than the second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phenomenon we were studying is so common and so important in the everyday world that you should know its name: it is an anchoring effect. It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. What happens is one of the most reliable and robust results of experimental psychology: the estimates stay close to the number that people considered—hence the image of an anchor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Anchoring Index
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The anchoring measure would be 100% for people who slavishly adopt the anchor as an estimate, and zero for people who are able to ignore the anchor altogether. The value of 55% that was observed in this example is typical. Similar values have been observed in numerous other problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powerful anchoring effects are found in decisions that people make about money, such as when they choose how much to contribute to a cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, a strategy of deliberately “thinking the opposite” may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchoring is when we start our analysis and struggle to move away from an initially suggested answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When given a starting point for a solution, System 2 will “anchor” its answer to this figure. It will then analyse whether the true value should be lower or higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, a sign in a shop that says “Limit of 12 per person” will cause people to take more items than a sign that says “No limit per person.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customers anchor their purchase decision to the number 12 because they are primed by System 1. We don’t start from a neutral point when deducing the solution and System 2 starts from a bias. This technique is exploited in real estate sales and all other forms of negotiation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;availability&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#availability&quot; aria-label=&quot;availability permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Availability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The availability heuristic, like other heuristics of judgment, substitutes one question for another: you wish to estimate the size of a category or the frequency of an event, but you report an impression of the ease with which instances come to mind. Substitution of questions inevitably produces systematic errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can discover how the heuristic leads to biases by following a simple procedure: list factors other than frequency that make it easy to come up with instances. Each factor in your list will be a potential source of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resisting this large collection of potential availability biases is possible, but tiresome. You must make the effort to reconsider your impressions and intuitions by asking such questions as, “Is our belief that thefts by teenagers are a major problem due to a few recent instances in our neighborhood?” or “Could it be that I feel no need to get a flu shot because none of my acquaintances got the flu last year?” Maintaining one’s vigilance against biases is a chore—but the chance to avoid a costly mistake is sometimes worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psychology of Availability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, people:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;believe that they use their bicycles less often after recalling many rather than few instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are less confident that an event was avoidable after listing more ways it could have been avoided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are less impressed by a car after listing many of its advantages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difficulty of coming up with more examples surprises people, and they subsequently change their judgement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are some conditions in which people “go with the flow” and are affected more strongly by ease of retrieval than by the content they retrieved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when they are engaged in another effortful task at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when they are in a good mood because they just thought of a happy episode in their life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if they score low on a depression scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if they are knowledgeable novices on the topic of the task, in contrast to true experts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when they score high on a scale of faith in intuition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if they are (or are made to feel) powerful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability bias happens when our thinking is influenced by our ability to recall examples.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System 1 can recall memories better than other evidence because of the cognitive ease heuristic. This makes them feel truer than facts and figures and System 2 will give them more weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we overestimate our contribution to group activities. The memory of ourselves completing a task is easier to recall than the memory of someone else doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availability also influences our estimation of risk. People’s experiences, or exposure through the media, cause most people to overestimate the likelihood and severity of otherwise rare risks and accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affect heuristic is an instance of substitution, in which the answer to an easy question (How do I feel about it?) serves as an answer to a much harder question (What do I think about it?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts sometimes measure things more objectively, weighing total number of lives saved, or something similar, while many citizens will judge “good” and “bad” types of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may start from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public panic and large-scale government action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alar tale illustrates a basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks: we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight—nothing in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s world, terrorists are the most significant practitioners of the art of inducing availability cascades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology should inform the design of risk policies that combine the experts’ knowledge with the public’s emotions and intuitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;representativeness&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#representativeness&quot; aria-label=&quot;representativeness permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Representativeness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representations form when the stories and norms established by System 1 become inseparable from an idea&lt;/strong&gt;. System 2 weighs System 1 representations more than evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one study, people were asked to give the probability that an example student would choose to study a particular degree. They paid more attention to the description of their character than statistics on student numbers. The “people who like sci-fi also like computer science” stereotype had more impact than “only 3% of graduates study computer science”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The representativeness heuristic is involved when someone says “She will win the election; you can see she is a winner” or “He won’t go far as an academic; too many tattoos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sin of representativeness is an excessive willingness to predict the occurrence of unlikely (low base-rate) events. Here is an example: you see a person reading The New York Times on the New York subway. Which of the following is a better bet about the reading stranger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She has a PhD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She does not have a college degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Representativeness would tell you to bet on the PhD, but this is not necessarily wise. You should seriously consider the second alternative, because many more nongraduates than PhDs ride in New York subways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second sin of representativeness is insensitivity to the quality of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one thing you can do when you have doubts about the quality of the evidence: let your judgments of probability stay close to the base rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential keys to disciplined Bayesian reasoning can be simply summarized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor your judgment of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question the diagnosticity of your evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you specify a possible event in greater detail you can only lower its probability. The problem therefore sets up a conflict between the intuition of representativeness and the logic of probability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;conjunction fallacy&lt;/em&gt;: when people judge a conjunction of two events to be more probable than one of the events in a direct comparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Representativeness belongs to a cluster of closely related basic assessments that are likely to be generated together. The most representative outcomes combine with the personality description to produce the most coherent stories. The most coherent stories are not necessarily the most probable, but they are plausible, and the notions of coherence, plausibility, and probability are easily confused by the unwary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conjunction fallacy, or the Linda problem, happens because System 1 prefers more complete stories (over simpler alternatives).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A scenario with more variables is less likely to be true. But because it provides a more complete and persuasive argument for System 1, System 2 can falsely estimate that it is more likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, a woman (‘Linda’) was described to participants in a study as “single, outspoken and very bright”. They were more likely to categorize her as a “bank teller who is an active feminist” than “a bank teller”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is less probable that someone would belong in the first category (since it requires two facts to be true), but it feels truer. It fits with the norm that System 1 has created around Linda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: This is why we struggle so much with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Occam’s Razor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Causes Trump Statistics bias is caused by System 1 preferring stories over numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, people were told that only 27% of subjects in an experiment went to help someone who sounded like they were choking in the next booth. Despite this low statistic, people predicted that subjects that appeared to be nice would be much more likely to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System 1 places more importance on causal links, than statistics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surprising anecdote of an individual case has more influence on our judgment than a surprising set of statistics. Some people were not told the results of the choking experiment but were told that the nice interviewees did not help. Their predictions of the overall results were then fairly accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An extension to this bias is that we put more faith in statistics that are presented in a way that easily links cause and effect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in a study were told 85% of cars involved in accidents are green. This statistic was cited more in decision-making about car crashes than if participants were told that 85% of cabs in a city are green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistically, the evidence is the same (if 85% of cars are green and cars of all colours crash equally then 85% of crashes will involve green cars) but one is more readily believed because it is structured to appeal to our love of storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important principle of skill training: rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes. This proposition is supported by much evidence from research on pigeons, rats, humans, and other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talent and Luck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My favourite equations:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;success = talent + luck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great success = a little more talent + a lot of luck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Regression&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general rule is straightforward but has surprising consequences: whenever the correlation between two scores is imperfect, there will be regression to the mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the correlation between the intelligence of spouses is less than perfect (and if men and women on average do not differ in intelligence), then it is a mathematical inevitability that highly intelligent women will be married to husbands who are on average less intelligent than they are (and vice versa, of course).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure to expect a regression to the mean is a bias that causes us to try to find plausible explanations for reversions from high or low performance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability tells us that abnormally high (or low) results are most likely to be followed by a result that’s closer to the overall mean than another extreme result. But the tendency of System 1 to look for causal effects, makes people disregard averages and look for stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the likelihood of a person achieving success in a particular sporting event is a combination of talent and chance. Average performance is the mean performance over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means an above (or below) average result on one day is likely to be followed by a more average performance the next. This has nothing to do with the above-average result. It’s just that if the probability of good performance follows a normal distribution then a result that tracks the mean will always be more likely than another extreme result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But people will try to find an explanation, such as high performance on the first day creates pressure on the second day. Or that high performance on the first day is the start of a “streak” and high performance on the second day is expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some predictive judgements, like those made by engineers, rely largely on lookup tables, precise calculations, and explicit analyses of outcomes observed on similar occasions. Others involve intuition and System 1, in two main varieties:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some intuitions draw primarily on skill and expertise acquired by repeated experience. The rapid and automatic judgements of chess masters, fire chiefs, and doctors illustrate these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others, which are sometimes subjectively indistinguishable from the first, arise from the operation of heuristics that often substitute an easy question for the harder one that was asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are capable of rejecting information as irrelevant or false, but adjusting for smaller weaknesses in the evidence is not something that System 1 can do. As a result, intuitive predictions are almost completely insensitive to the actual predictive quality of the evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Correction for Inuitive Predictions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recall that the correlation between two measures—in the present case reading age and GPA—is equal to the proportion of shared factors among their determinants. What is your best guess about that proportion? My most optimistic guess is about 30%. Assuming this estimate, we have all we need to produce an unbiased prediction. Here are the directions for how to get there in four simple steps:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with an estimate of average GPA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the GPA that matches your impression of the evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate the correlation between your evidence and GPA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the correlation is .30, move 30% of the distance from the average to the matching GPA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the pitfalls of relying on the intuitions of System 1, System 2 cannot function without it. We are often faced with problems where information is incomplete, and we need to estimate to come up with an answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kahneman suggests the following process for overcoming the inaccuracies of System 1:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start from a ‘base’ result by looking at average or statistical information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separately, estimate what you would expect the result to be based on your beliefs and intuitions about the specific scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate what the correlation is between your intuitions and the outcome you are predicting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply this correlation to the difference between the ‘base’ and your intuitive estimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is vital that we activate System 2 when trying to predict extreme examples, and avoid relying on the intuition that System 1 provides us with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Taleb: narrative fallacy: our tendency to reshape the past into coherent stories that shape our views of the world and expectations for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result, we tend to overestimate skill, and underestimate luck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once humans adopt a new view of the world, we have difficulty recalling our old view, and how much we were surprised by past events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome bias: our tendency to put too much blame on decision makers for bad outcomes vs. good ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This both influences risk aversion, and disproportionately rewarding risky behaviour (the entrepreneur who gambles big and wins).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At best, a good CEO is about 10% better than random guessing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hindsight Bias is caused by overconfidence in our ability to explain the past.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a surprising event happens, System 1 quickly adjusts our views of the world to accommodate it (see creating new norms).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem is we usually forget the viewpoint we held before the event occurred. We don’t keep track of our failed predictions. This causes us to underestimate how surprised we were and overestimate our understanding at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, in 1972, participants in a study were asked to predict the outcome of a meeting between Nixon and Mao Zedong. Depending on whether they were right or wrong, respondents later misremembered (or changed) their original prediction when asked to re-report it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hindsight bias influences how much we link the outcome of an event to decisions that were made. We associate bad outcomes with poor decisions because hindsight makes us think the event should have been able to be anticipated. This was a common bias in reactions to the CIA after the 9/11 attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, decision-making is not given enough credit for good outcomes. Our hindsight bias makes us believe that “everyone knew” an event would play out as it did. This is observed when people are asked about (and downplay) the role of CEOs in successful companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often vastly overvalue the evidence at hand; discount the amount of evidence and its quality in favour of the better story, and follow the people we love and trust with no evidence in other cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illusion of skill is maintained by powerful professional cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts/pundits are rarely better (and often worse) than random chance, yet often believe at a much higher confidence level in their predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Illusion of Validity is caused by overconfidence in our ability to assess situations and predict outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to believe that their skill, and System 1-based intuition, is better than blind luck. This is true even when faced with evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies of stock market traders, for example, find the least active traders are the most successful. Decisions to buy or sell are often no more successful than random 50/50 choices. Despite this evidence, there exists a huge industry built around individuals touting their self-perceived ability to predict and beat the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, groups that have some information tend to perform slightly better than pure chance when asked to make a forecast. Meanwhile, groups that have a lot of information tend to perform worse. This is because they become overconfident in themselves and the intuitions they believe they have developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithms based on statistics are more accurate than the predictions of professionals in a field. But people are unlikely to trust formulas because they believe human intuitions are more important. Intuition may be more valuable in some extreme examples that lie outside a formula, but these cases are not very common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;intuitions-vs-formulas&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#intuitions-vs-formulas&quot; aria-label=&quot;intuitions vs formulas permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Intuitions vs. Formulas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of studies have concluded that algorithms are better than expert judgement, or at least as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research suggests a surprising conclusion: to maximize predictive accuracy, final decisions should be left to formulas, especially in low-validity environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recent research went further: formulas that assign equal weights to all the predictors are often superior, because they are not affected by accidents of sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a memorable example, Dawes showed that marital stability is well predicted by a formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frequency of lovemaking minus frequency of quarrels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important conclusion from this research is that an algorithm that is constructed on the back of an envelope is often good enough to compete with an optimally weighted formula, and certainly good enough to outdo expert judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuition can be useful, but only when applied systematically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To implement a good interview procedure:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select some traits required for success (six is a good number). Try to ensure they are independent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of questions for each trait, and think about how you will score it from 1-5 (what would warrant a 1, what would make a 5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect information as you go, assessing each trait in turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then add up the scores at the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When can we trust intuition/judgements? The answer comes from the two basic conditions for acquiring a skill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When both these conditions are satisfied, intuitions are likely to be skilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether professionals have a chance to develop intuitive expertise depends essentially on the quality and speed of feedback, as well as on sufficient opportunity to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among medical specialties, anesthesiologists benefit from good feedback, because the effects of their actions are likely to be quickly evident. In contrast, radiologists obtain little information about the accuracy of the diagnoses they make and about the pathologies they fail to detect. Anesthesiologists are therefore in a better position to develop useful intuitive skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kahneman says some experts can develop their intuitions so their System 1 thinking becomes highly reliable. They have been exposed to enough variations in scenarios and their outcomes to intuitively know which course of action is likely to be best. In studies with firefighting teams, commanders were observed to use their intuition to select the best approach to fight a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all fields yield experts that can enhance their intuitions, however. It needs immediate and unambiguous feedback, and the opportunity to practice in a regular environment. Expert intuition can be developed by chess players, for example, but not by political scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;inside view&lt;/em&gt;: when we focus on our specific circumstances and search for evidence in our own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also: when you fail to account for unknown unknowns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;outside view&lt;/em&gt;: when you take into account a proper reference class/base rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Planning fallacy&lt;/em&gt;: plans and forecasts that are unrealistically close to best-case scenarios could be improved by consulting the statistics of similar cases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reference class forecasting&lt;/em&gt;: the treatment for the planning fallacy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outside view is implemented by using a large database, which provides information on both plans and outcomes for hundreds of projects all over the world, and can be used to provide statistical information about the likely overruns of cost and time, and about the likely underperformance of projects of different types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecasting method that Flyvbjerg applies is similar to the practices recommended for overcoming base-rate neglect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify an appropriate reference class (kitchen renovations, large railway projects, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtain the statistics of the reference class (in terms of cost per mile of railway, or of the percentage by which expenditures exceeded budget). Use the statistics to generate a baseline prediction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use specific information about the case to adjust the baseline prediction, if there are particular reasons to expect the optimistic bias to be more or less pronounced in this project than in others of the same type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizations face the challenge of controlling the tendency of executives competing for resources to present overly optimistic plans. A well-run organization will reward planners for precise execution and penalize them for failing to anticipate difficulties, and for failing to allow for difficulties that they could not have anticipated—the unknown unknowns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insider Blindness is a biased overconfidence that develops from within a team that is involved in completing a task.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inside view is biased to be overconfident about the success of the task. It tends to underestimate the possibility of failure, in what is known as the ‘planning fallacy’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Kahneman describes a textbook that he and his colleagues started to write. They thought the project would take two years but an expert in curriculums found that similar projects took much longer. The team continued the project despite the outside view and the book took eight years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insider blindness leads to assessments of difficulty based on the initial part of the project. This is usually the easiest part and is completed when motivation is highest. This “Inside View” can also better visualize best-case scenarios and does not want to predict that a project should be abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimism bias&lt;/em&gt;: always viewing positive outcomes or angles of events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danger: losing track of reality and underestimating the role of luck, as well as the risk involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and mitigate the optimism bias, you should a) be aware of likely biases and planning fallacies that can affect those who are predisposed to optimism, and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform a premortem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The procedure is simple: when the organization has almost come to an important decision but has not formally committed itself, Klein proposes gathering for a brief session a group of individuals who are knowledgeable about the decision. The premise of the session is a short speech: “Imagine that we are a year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The outcome was a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An optimistic outlook gives people overconfidence in their ability to overcome obstacles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite statistical evidence, people believe that they will beat the odds. This is often observed in business start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Canadian inventor’s organization developed a rating system that could predict the success of inventions. No products with a D or E rating have ever become commercial. But almost half of the inventors who received these grades continued to invest in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence and optimism encourage people to set unachievable goals and take more risks. Whilst it can be useful in maintaining commitment, it can cause people to overlook the basic facts of why a venture is unlikely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reasons often have nothing to do with the abilities of the people involved. For example, a hotel that failed with six previous owners still sells to a seventh owner. Despite evidence to the contrary, the new owners believe they are the game-changing factor rather than location and competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic models used to be built on the assumption that people are logical, selfish, and stable. A dollar was a dollar no matter what the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Bernoulli proposed the ‘utility theory’. A dollar has a different value in different scenarios, because of psychological effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, ten dollars has more utility for someone who owns one hundred dollars than for someone who owns a million dollars. We make decisions based not only on the probability of an outcome but on how much utility we can gain or lose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bernoulli’s Error&lt;/strong&gt;: theory-induced blindness: once you have accepted a theory and used it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;prospect-theory&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#prospect-theory&quot; aria-label=&quot;prospect theory permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Prospect Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s clear now that there are three cognitive features at the heart of prospect theory. They play an essential role in the evaluation of financial outcomes and are common to many automatic processes of perception, judgment, and emotion. They should be seen as operating characteristics of System 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation is relative to a neutral reference point, which is sometimes referred to as an “adaptation level.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For financial outcomes, the usual reference point is the status quo, but it can also be the outcome that you expect, or perhaps the outcome to which you feel entitled, for example, the raise or bonus that your colleagues receive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcomes that are better than the reference points are gains. Below the reference point they are losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A principle of diminishing sensitivity applies to both sensory dimensions and the evaluation of changes of wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third principle is loss aversion. When directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains. This asymmetry between the power of positive and negative expectations or experiences has an evolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem? Bernoulli’s theory cannot explain the outcomes of some economic, behavioral studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kahneman built on utility theory with Prospect theory – the value of money is influenced by biases from System 1 thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prospect theory explains why economic decisions are based on changes in wealth, and that losses affect people more than gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “loss aversion ratio” has been estimated in several experiments and is usually in the range of 1.5 to 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss aversion is the part of prospect theory that says people will prefer to avoid losses rather than seek gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is observed in many different scenarios. A golfer will play for par rather than for birdies and contract negotiations stall to avoid one party making a concession. We judge companies as acting unfairly if they create a loss for the customer or employees to increase profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospect theory is based on the premise that people make judgments based on the pain that they feel from a loss. Since decisions are influenced by an emotional reaction, prospect theory and aversion loss are a result of System 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss aversion runs so deeply, it leads to the sunk cost fallacy. People will take further risks to try and recover from a large loss that has already happened. There is a fear of regret, that the decision to walk away will lock in a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain responds quicker to bad words (war, crime) than happy words (peace, love).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are set to look for it, the asymmetric intensity of the motives to avoid losses and to achieve gains shows up almost everywhere. It is an ever-present feature of negotiations, especially of renegotiations of an existing contract, the typical situation in labor negotiations and in international discussions of trade or arms limitations. The existing terms define reference points, and a proposed change in any aspect of the agreement is inevitably viewed as a concession that one side makes to the other. Loss aversion creates an asymmetry that makes agreements difficult to reach. The concessions you make to me are my gains, but they are your losses; they cause you much more pain than they give me pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endowment effect&lt;/em&gt;: for certain goods, the status quo is preferred, particularly for goods that are not regularly traded or for goods intended “for use” - to be consumed or otherwise enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: not present when owners view their goods as carriers of value for future exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The endowment effect is the increase in value that people apply to a product because they own it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospect theory says that loss aversion is stronger than any potential gain. This applies even when there is a guaranteed profit to be made from selling an owned product. The profit needs to be enough to overcome the endowment effect, or the perception of loss, for people to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you form a global evaluation of a complex object—a car you may buy, your son-in-law, or an uncertain situation—you assign weights to its characteristics. This is simply a cumbersome way of saying that some characteristics influence your assessment more than others do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we looked at our choices for bad options, we quickly realized that we were just as risk seeking in the domain of losses as we were risk averse in the domain of gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Certainty effect&lt;/em&gt;: at high probabilities, we seek to avoid loss and therefore accept worse outcomes in exchange for certainty, and take high risk in exchange for possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possibility effect&lt;/em&gt;: at low probabilities, we seek a large gain despite risk, and avoid risk despite a poor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we identified two reasons for this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, there is diminishing sensitivity. The sure loss is very aversive because the reaction to a loss of $900 is more than 90% as intense as the reaction to a loss of $1,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second factor may be even more powerful: the decision weight that corresponds to a probability of 90% is only about 71, much lower than the probability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many unfortunate human situations unfold in the top right cell. This is where people who face very bad options take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to prospect theory, we overestimate highly improbable outcomes. This is because System 1 is drawn to the emotions associated with a highly unlucky or lucky outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People become risk-averse to avoid an unlikely disappointment or seek out risk for the chance of an unlikely windfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in scenarios with a 95% chance of winning, people will focus on the 5% chance of loss and choose a 100% win option with a lower value. They accept an unfavorable settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In scenarios with a 5% chance of a large gain, like the lottery, people will choose this option over a sure win of a small amount. They reject a reasonable settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rare events, like plane crashes, also tend to be overestimated according to prospect theory. This is partly because the improbable outcome is overestimated. It is also because the chance of the event not happening is difficult to calculate. System 1 applies its ‘what you see is what you get’ bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The probability of a rare event is most likely to be overestimated when the alternative is not fully specified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotion and vividness influence fluency, availability, and judgments of probability—and thus account for our excessive response to the few rare events that we do not ignore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding vivid details, salience and attention to a rare event will increase the weighting of an unlikely outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When this doesn’t occur, we tend to neglect the rare event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;context&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#context&quot; aria-label=&quot;context permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In prospect theory, the context of how choices are presented affects our decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people consider risk, they prefer to view choices one by one. The cumulative effect of decisions, which would give a better picture of overall risk, is more difficult to assess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is System 1’s tendency to frame questions into the one with the most cognitive ease, and the ‘what you see is what you get’ bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, in a coin flip where you can lose $100 or win $200, you will win more money the more times you play, because the average outcome is to gain $50 each time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People that are asked if they would like to make five bets are more likely to accept than if people are asked on five separate occasions. They cannot consider the cumulative effect of many bets unless they are presented with it in a simple and obvious way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that risk is presented can also provide a prime for a System 1 bias, especially if one option is associated with an emotional outcome like a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, people were given two options for a medication program for a disease. One can save a third of the people who contract a disease, the second has a two-thirds probability that no one can be saved. The options are the same but most people will select the first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two ways of construing decisions i and ii:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;narrow framing: a sequence of two simple decisions, considered separately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;broad framing: a single comprehensive decision, with four options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broad framing was obviously superior in this case. Indeed, it will be superior (or at least not inferior) in every case in which several decisions are to be contemplated together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decision makers who are prone to narrow framing construct a preference every time they face a risky choice. They would do better by having a risk policy that they routinely apply whenever a relevant problem arises. Familiar examples of risk policies are “always take the highest possible deductible when purchasing insurance” and “never buy extended warranties.” A risk policy is a broad frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping Score&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agency problem&lt;/em&gt;: when the incentives of an agent are in conflict with the objectives of a larger group, such as when a manager continues investing in a project because he has backed it, when it’s in the firms best interest to cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sunk-cost fallacy&lt;/em&gt;: the decision to invest additional resources in a losing account, when better investments are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disposition effect&lt;/em&gt;: the preference to end something on a positive, seen in investment when there is a much higher preference to sell winners and “end positive” than sell losers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An instance of &lt;em&gt;narrow framing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regret&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People expect to have stronger emotional reactions (including regret) to an outcome produced by action than to the same outcome when it is produced by inaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To inoculate against regret: be explicit about your anticipation of it, and consider it when making decisions. Also try and preclude hindsight bias (document your decision-making process).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also know that people generally anticipate more regret than they will actually experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should make sure to keep a broad frame when evaluating something; seeing cases in isolation is more likely to lead to a System 1 reaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frames and Reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The framing of something influences the outcome to a great degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, your moral feelings are attached to frames, to descriptions of reality rather than to reality itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another example: the best single predictor of whether or not people will donate their organs is the designation of the default option that will be adopted without having to check the box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System 1 creates problems when we evaluate our experiences, including our happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kahneman states that we have two selves. The ‘experience self’ evaluates outcomes as they happen. The ‘remembering self’ evaluates the outcome after the event. The remembering self tends to have more power in decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remembering self uses the peak-end rule, placing more importance on the end of an experience than any other part. It also suffers duration neglect, where the length of an experience is disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study, people were given the option of two painful procedures. One lasts eight minutes and gradually increases in pain until the end. The second lasts twenty-four minutes and has the same intensity of pain but in the middle. Most people will choose the second procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remembering self will also choose options that value the memory of an experience, more than the experience itself. Likewise, it will choose to suffer pain if that pain can be erased from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking people about overall life satisfaction is an important measure in many studies. But System 1 tends to replace this difficult question with an easier one. The remembering self answers about how they have felt recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kahneman proposes a better methodology for prompting the experience self. He has conducted studies that ask people to reconstruct their previous day. This gives a better measure of well-being and happiness and has resulted in better insights into how this is affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Selves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peak-end rule&lt;/em&gt;: The global retrospective rating was well predicted by the average of the level of pain reported at the worst moment of the experience and at its end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to overrate the end of an experience when remembering the whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duration neglect&lt;/em&gt;: The duration of the procedure had no effect whatsoever on the ratings of total pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally: we tend to ignore the duration of an event when evaluating an experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confusing experience with the memory of it is a compelling cognitive illusion—and it is the substitution that makes us believe a past experience can be ruined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experienced Well-Being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One way to improve experience is to shift from passive leisure (TV watching) to active leisure, including socializing and exercising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second-best predictor of feelings of a day is whether a person did or did not have contacts with friends or relatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is only a slight exaggeration to say that happiness is the experience of spending time with people you love and who love you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can money buy happiness? Being poor makes one miserable, being rich may enhance one’s life satisfaction, but does not (on average) improve experienced well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Severe poverty amplifies the effect of other misfortunes of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The satiation level beyond which experienced well-being no longer increases was a household income of about $75,000 in high-cost areas (it could be less in areas where the cost of living is lower). The average increase of experienced well-being associated with incomes beyond that level was precisely zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking About Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced well-being is on average unaffected by marriage, not because marriage makes no difference to happiness but because it changes some aspects of life for the better and others for the worse (how one’s time is spent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for the low correlations between individuals’ circumstances and their satisfaction with life is that both experienced happiness and life satisfaction are largely determined by the genetics of temperament. A disposition for well-being is as heritable as height or intelligence, as demonstrated by studies of twins separated at birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance that people attached to income at age 18 also anticipated their satisfaction with their income as adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who wanted money and got it were significantly more satisfied than average; those who wanted money and didn’t get it were significantly more dissatisfied. The same principle applies to other goals—one recipe for a dissatisfied adulthood is setting goals that are especially difficult to attain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measured by life satisfaction 20 years later, the least promising goal that a young person could have was “becoming accomplished in a performing art.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focusing illusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miswanting&lt;/em&gt;: bad choices that arise from errors of affective forecasting; common example is the focusing illusion causing us overweight the effect of purchases on our future well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A single cockroach will completely wreck the appeal of a bowl of cherries, but a cherry will do nothing at all for a bowl of cockroaches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea that the future is unpredictable is undermined every day by the [misleading] ease with which the past is explained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are rarely stumped. The normal state of your mind is that you have intuitive feelings and opinions about almost everything that comes your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, professional, institutional/fund managers are restrained by cultural, legal and social barriers. Many are held back by various written rules and regulations. Some bank trust departments simply won’t’ allow the buying of stock in any companies/unions. Others won’t invest in non-growth industries or specific industry groups, such as electric utilities or oil or steel. Some funds are further restricted with a market capitalization rule: they don’t own stock in any company below, say, a $100 million size (Size is measured by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the stock price.). Hence, individual and amateur investors have the edge over most professional and institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynch is a “story” investor. Each stock selection is based on a well-grounded expectation concerning the firm’s growth prospects. The expectations are derived from the company’s “story”—what it is that the company will do or what will happen to bring about the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more familiar you are with a company, and the better you understand its business and competitive environment, the better your chances of finding a good “story” will come true. For this reason, Lynch is a strong advocate of investing in companies with which one is familiar or whose products or services are relatively easy to understand. Thus, Lynch says he would rather invest in “pantyhose rather than communications satellites,” and “motel chains rather than fibre optics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynch does not believe in restricting investments to any one type of stock. His “story” approach suggests the opposite: investments in firms with various reasons for favourable expectations. In general, however, he tends to favour small, moderately fast-growing companies that can be bought at a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;market-timing&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#market-timing&quot; aria-label=&quot;market timing permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;MARKET TIMING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lynch constantly rechecked stocks and stories, adding/subtracting as things changed. But he never went into cash – except to have enough of it to cover anticipated redemptions. Going into cash = getting out of the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His idea was to stay in the market forever and to rotate stocks depending on the fundamental situations. If you decide that a certain amount you’ve invested in the stock market will always be invested in the stock market, you’ll save yourself a lot of mistimed moves and general agony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bearish argument always sounds more intelligent. It’s said that “the market climbs a wall of worry” take note that the worry wall is fairly good-sized &amp;#x26; growing every day. That’s not to say there’s no such thing as an overvalued market, but there’s no point worrying about it. The way you’ll know the market is overvalued is when you can’t find a single company that’s reasonably priced or meets your other investment criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corrections (&gt;10% decline) occur every two years, bear markets (&gt;20%) every six years, and severe bear markets (&gt;30%) have happened five times between 1932/33-2000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’d be wonderful if we could avoid setbacks with timely exits, but nobody can predict them. Moreover, if you exit stocks &amp;#x26; avoid a decline, how can you be sure that you’ll get back in for the next rally?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things inside humans make them terrible stock market timers. Unwary investors continually pass through 3 emotional states:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Concern: he’s concerned after a market drop or when the economy seems to falter, which keeps him from buying good companies at bargain prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Complacency: after he buys at higher prices, he gets complacent because his stocks are going up. This is precisely when he ought to be concerned enough to check the fundamentals but isn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Capitulation: finally, when his stocks fall on hard times and prices fall below the purchase price, he capitulates and sells in a fit of irritation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you spend 13 minutes on economics (forecasting the future), you’ve wasted 10 minutes. Think about what’s happening - deal in facts, not forecasts. That’s crystal ball stuff, which doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming you forecast a big market decline, how can you prepare? Mostly by doing nothing. A market calamity is different from a meteorological calamity. Since we’ve learned to take action to protect ourselves from snowstorms, it’s only natural that we would try to prepare ourselves for corrections, even though this is one case where being prepared can be ruinous.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) The 1st mistake is hedging the portfolio. Anticipating a drop in the market, the skittish investor begins to dabble in futures and options, thinking of this as correction insurance. It seems cheap at first, but the options expire every couple of months, &amp;#x26; if stocks don’t go down on schedule, people have to buy more options to renew the policy. Suddenly, investing isn’t so simple. Investors can’t decide whether they’re rooting for stocks to falter, so their insurance will pay off or for a rally for the sake of the portfolio. Hedging is a tricky business even the pros haven’t mastered – otherwise, why’d so many hedge funds go out of business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) The 2nd and more prevalent mistake is the ritual known as lightening up, selling some or all stocks. Or putting off buying stocks you like &amp;#x26; sitting on cash, waiting for the crash. “Better safe than sorry” is the mantra. “I’ll wait for the day of reckoning when all the suckers who didn’t see this coming are wailing and gnashing their teeth, and I’ll snap up bargains left and right.” (But once the market bottoms, cash sitters are likely to continue to sit on cash. They’re waiting for further declines that never come, and they miss the rebound.). They may still call themselves long-term investors, but they’re not. They’ve turned into market timers &amp;#x26; unless their timing is very good, the market will run away from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People waste time figuring out “When should I invest?” Lynch did a study – for 30 years (1965-1995), if you had incredibly good luck investing $1,000 at the yearly low, your return would’ve been 11.7%. Some other unlucky souls put $1,000 at the yearly high, earning 10.6%. That’s the only difference between the yearly high and low. Someone else put it on the 1st day of the year, earning 11%. Just buy, hold, and add to it when the market goes down 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only problem with market timing is getting the timing right. You’ll never meet many people who’ve done it successfully. Maybe once in a row, but not consistently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s no telling how many timers miss big gains by making ill-timed exits. Far more money has been lost trying to anticipate corrections or preparing for corrections than has been lost in corrections themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People have more time than they think to ride out corrections, which is why you shouldn’t worry about the next one. Corrections are unpredictable. By selling stocks to avoid pain, you can miss the next gain. As soon as you realize you can afford to wait out any correction, the calamity also&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;becomes an opportunity to pick up bargains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself this: If stock prices dropped 10- 25%, would you add to your positions, or would you cash out and cut your losses? If&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you’d cash out, then do it now &amp;#x26; avoid the misery that is sure to come later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 40-year review of the S&amp;#x26;P 500 going back to 1954 shows how expensive it is to be out of stocks during the short stretches when they make their biggest jumps. If you kept all your money in stocks throughout, your annual return was 11.4%. If you were out of stock for the ten most profitable months, your return dropped to 8.3%. If you missed the 20 most profitable months, your return was 6.1%; in the 40 most profitable, you made only 2.7%. If you cut enough losses, there’s nothing left to cut sooner or later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If It’s Gone Down This Much Already&lt;/em&gt;, It Can’t Go Down Much More – the only thing to keep in mind is the intrinsic value vs current price. As long as the value stays high or improves, a falling price only helps to make it a better bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Can Always Tell When A Stock Hits A Bottom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must buy for a more sensible reason than a stock’s gone so far. It looks up to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a good idea to wait until the knife hits the ground, sticks, vibrates for a while, and settles down before you grab it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But even so, you don’t get the bottom price. What usually happens is that a stock sort of vibrates itself out before it starts up again. Generally, this takes 2-3 years, sometimes longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find charts of those companies that declined sharply and then went sideways for a couple of years. If it’s gone sideways for some time, fundamentals are decent, &amp;#x26; you can find something that’s new &amp;#x26; positive in the company/ industry, then if you’re wrong, it’ll probably keep going sideways, and you won’t lose much. But if you’re right, that stock is going north.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If It’s Gone This High Already, How Can It Possibly Go Higher?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multibaggers break these barriers, year after year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never able to predict which stocks will go up 10x or 5x. Stick with them as long as the story’s intact, hoping to be pleasantly surprised. A company’s success isn’t the surprise, but what the shares bring often is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Only $3 A Share, What Can I Lose?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it goes to 0, you still lose everything. A lousy cheap stock is as risky as a lousy, expensive one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short sellers usually buy nearer to the bottom than to the top. They wait until a company is so obviously floundering that bankruptcy is inevitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eventually, They Always Come Back&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider the thousands of companies that went bankrupt or solvent ones that never recovered prosperity or were bought out at prices far below their peak price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s Always Darkest Before The Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the human tendency to believe things that have gotten a little bad can’t get worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When It Rebounds To $10, I’ll Sell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No downtrodden stock ever returns to the level you’ve decided to sell. This painful process may take a decade, and all this while, you’ll tolerate an investment you don’t even like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless you’re confident enough to buy more, you should be selling immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What, Me Worry? Conservative Stocks Don’t Fluctuate Much&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilities can be as risky as Biotech, even riskier because you aren’t aware of unknown changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s Taking Too Long For Anything To Happen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you give up because you’re waiting for something wonderful to happen, then something wonderful will happen the day after you sell. It takes remarkable patience to hold onto a stock that excites you but which is ignored by everybody else. You begin to think others are right and you’re wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the money Lynch made was in the 3rd/4th year. If fundamentals are positive and whatever attracted you hasn’t changed, then sooner or later,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;patience will be rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look At All The Money I Lost, I Didn’t Buy It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You aren’t a cent poorer than you were – money lost via fictional missed opportunities and omission errors are self-torture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This isn’t a productive attitude. It can only lead to total madness. o The worst part about such thinking is that it leads people to try to catch up by buying stocks they shouldn’t if only to protect themselves from losing more than they’ve already “lost.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Missed That One; I’ll Catch The Next One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original good company at a high price is better than the next bargain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trouble is the next one rarely works. If you missed a great company that continued to go up and then bought a mediocre one that went down, you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;took a mistake that cost nothing and turned it into a mistake that cost plenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stocks Gone Up, So I Must Be Right…or…The Stocks have Gone Down, So I Must Be Wrong&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people confuse prices with prospects. The short-term fanfare means nothing unless they’re short-term traders looking for 20% gains. Price movements after your purchase only tell you that someone was willing to pay more/less for the identical merchandise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Lag: a stock isn’t truly attractive until some large institutions have recognized its suitability and an equal number of analysts recommend it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t believe that professional management has brought new prudence, sophistication &amp;#x26; intelligence to the market. These stock pickers are usually right, but only for the last 20% of a typical stock move. It’s that last 20% that they study for, clamour for, and then line up for – all the while with a sharp eye on the exits. The idea is to make a quick gain and stampede out the door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small investors don’t have to fight this mob. They can calmly walk in the entrance when there’s a crowd at the exit and walk out the exit when there’s a crowd at the entrance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fund manager is looking for reasons “not” to buy exciting stocks so that he can offer the proper excuses if these exciting stocks go up. Too small, no track record, non-growth industry, union employees, unproven management, high competition – these may be reasonable concerns that merit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the investigation is often used to fortify snap judgments and wholesale taboos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unwritten rule: you’ll never lose your job, losing client money on IBM. Clients &amp;#x26; bosses will ask what’s wrong with IBM. But if an investment in a small unknown company goes bad, they’ll ask, what’s wrong with you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discounting = Euphemism for pretending to have anticipated surprising results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A stock does not know that you own it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting the Most out of a Broker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re probably paying much higher commissions if you use a full-service broker. Make them sweat for their money if you use their services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use the broker as an advisor, make him do the 2-minute drill, category of stock, recent growth in earnings, p/e ratio relative to historic levels, expansion plans, debt situation, insider buy, buying back share, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calling the Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amateurs never call; professionals do so all the time. For specific questions, investor relation is a good source. In small companies, you may reach high-placed executives when you call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before calling, prepare questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do small talk before asking serious questions about business conditions, plans, the mood at the company, or anything unusual in the recent quarter. Pepper questions with little information so the source thinks you’re prepared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you want is a reaction to whatever script you’ve been trying to develop. Does it make sense? Is it working? Enquire about inventories, product/project development, capacity utilization, prices, debt repayments, market share, expansion, and asset values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t ask, Why is the share price falling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t ask about expected EPS directly. An indirect, subtle way to do this is to ask about Wall Street EPS estimates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your storyline is well-developed, you’ll know what to ask. Even if you don’t have a script, simply ask:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the positives this year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the negatives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sum up a conversation as follows: 4 positives and three negatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll find something extraordinary in 1/10 calls. While calling depressed companies, nine will confirm bad news, as expected, but one will give some cause for optimism, which isn’t generally perceived. The unexpected can be very profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always end the discussion with: which competitor you respect the most? Managers speak negatively about competition 95% of the time, which doesn’t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mean much. However, nothing is more bullish than a rival’s begrudging respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visiting Headquarters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a feel for the place. When was the last time an analyst visited? The longer the period, the better it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad signs include fine antiques, expensive furnishings, furniture, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can also inform front office employees and investor relation representatives at annual meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the net worth of company representatives based on shares held. If you can’t imagine how a representative got so rich and could get richer if the stock rises, you may be right, and the share may truly be overpriced. Does that person ‘deserve’ to be so rich?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check cash and marketable securities in the current assets section. If together it exceeds long-term debt in the long-term liability section, it’s very favourable. No matter what happens, the company isn’t about to go out of business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume other current assets, including a/c receivable, inventories, and other current assets are valuable enough to cover the short-term debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the long-term debt exceeds cash, the cash has been shrinking, and debt has been growing, the company is in weak financial shape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Debt reduction is another sign of prosperity. When cash increases relative to debt, it’s an improving balance sheet. When it’s the other way around, it’s a deteriorating balance sheet.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a personal rule, once a month, Lynch held at least one personal conversation with a representative of each major industry group just in case business was starting to turn around, or Wall Street overlooked new developments. This was an effective early warning system, and in 2/10 cases, he’d discover something important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful to note the name of everyone you meet. After every contact, note the company, current price and a 1-2 line summary of the story you’d just heard. Every investor benefits from keeping such notes, without which, it’s easy to forget buying reasons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;designing-a-portfolio&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#designing-a-portfolio&quot; aria-label=&quot;designing a portfolio permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;DESIGNING A PORTFOLIO&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in bonds, money markets, or CDs are different forms of debt—for which one pays interest. Historically debt instruments have recorded less than 5% gains. In bonds, you’re nothing more than the nearest source of spare change. When you lend money to somebody, the best you can hope for is to get it back, plus interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portfolio design may change as you grow older. Younger investors, with a lifetime of earnings ahead of them, can afford to take more chances on 10x opportunities, vs older investors who may want to live off dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determine Stock: Bond Mix based on Growth: Income wants. Most people err on the side of income and short-change growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can hardly go wrong by making a full portfolio of companies that have raised dividends for 10-20 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock allocation % depends on how much you can afford to invest in stocks and how quickly you will need to spend this money. Increase the stock % to the limits of your tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 50/50 portfolio, combined return = 4.5% (1.5% dividend + 7.5% 10 year bonds). Historically, stocks return 10% = 8% growth + 2% dividend yield. So portfolio growth in 50/50 mix = 4%, (8+0)/2, which is &amp;#x3C; Inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s incorrect to state that you can’t afford the loss in fixed income because, over the long term, growth more than makes up for any losses. But the fear factor comes into play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person who uses stocks as a substitute for bonds not only must ride out the periodic corrections but also must be prepared to sell shares, sometimes at depressed prices, to meet living expenses. This is especially difficult in the early stages when a market setback could cause portfolios to drop below the purchase price. Such worries of wiping out the capital keep people in bonds, even when they’re aware of the long-term wisdom of investing in stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume that the day you go 100% into stocks, the market corrects 25%. You’d still equal bond returns, even if you imagine the most prolonged disaster in modern finance – a 20-year severe recession when earnings and dividends only grow at 4% instead of 8%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds vs Bond Funds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30-year T-bond is safe only if you get 30 years of low inflation. If inflation is &gt;10%, the bonds will lose 20-30% of their value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonds are safer to buy in funds, only if they’re corporate / junk bonds, where diversification limits default risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks vs Stock Funds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to benefit from funds is to keep owning it, just like owning a stock. This requires a strong will. Fund investments don’t solve the problem for people who can be scared out of stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett’s admonition that people who can’t tolerate seeing their stocks lose 50% of their value shouldn’t own stocks also applies to funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a correction, it’s common for the best-performing funds to decline &gt; the average stock. To benefit, you’ve to stay invested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribute equity portfolio by buying several funds of varying styles and philosophies. Markets and conditions change, and one style of manager or fund won’t succeed in all seasons.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Capital Appreciation: can buy all types of stocks and isn’t forced to adhere to any particular philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Value: Assets, not earnings, are the main attraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Quality Growth: Mid-Large cap companies that are well established, expanding at a respectable and steady rate, increasing earnings at &gt;15%. This cuts out cyclical, slow-growing blue chips and utilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iv) Emerging Growth: small caps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v) Special Situations: companies have nothing in common except that something unique has occurred to change their prospects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone can create a stock portfolio by picking one fund from each of the above and adding one more fund that invests in utilities/equity income funds as ballast for stormy markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can also add two index funds, one for S&amp;#x26;P 500 (covers quality growth) and Russell 2000 (covers emerging growth).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide money equally between funds and also deploy new money equally. The sophisticated way to do it is to adjust the weight of the funds, putting Only the new money into sectors that have lagged. When any fund does poorly, the natural temptation is to switch to a better fund. People, who switch, tend to lose patience at precisely the wrong time, jumping from a value fund to a growth fund just as value is starting to wax and growth is starting to wane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-when a value fund does better than its rivals in a bad year for value style, it’s not necessarily a cause for celebration. It may be so that the manager has used other styles to outperform in the short term, but such benefits will be fleeting. When value returns, he won’t be fully invested in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks in the general checklist
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The p/e ratio compare to similar companies within the same industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentage of institutional ownership. The lower, the better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insider buying &amp;#x26; whether the company itself is buying back shares. Both are positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record of earnings growth and whether the earnings are sporadic or consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong balance sheet or weak. The debt-to-equity ratio and cash position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking a Winner
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t spend much time on a fund’s past performance. Not to say you shouldn’t pick a fund with a good long-term record, but it’s better to stick with a steady and consistent performer, vs, a fund whose performance moves in and out of best / worst performing lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check bear market performance. Some funds lose more but regain more on the rebound; some lose less &amp;#x26; gain less; while some lose more &amp;#x26; gain less. Avoid the third group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forbes grades funds A-F, based on their performance in the 2 preceding bear and bull markets. Funds that fare A/B in both situations get into the honour roll.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sector Funds: not recommended unless you’ve special industry knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convertible Funds: an underrated way to enjoy the best of both worlds – high performance of secondary and small-cap stocks + stability of bonds. Customarily, the conversion price is 20-25% higher than the market price. Investors are better off investing via funds rather than directly. Buy convertible funds when the spread between convertible and corporate bonds is narrow (1.5-2%), and sell when it widens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed-End Funds: trade on exchanges, ∴ fluctuate like stocks – selling at a discount/premium to NAV. Look for opportunities during market sell-offs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Country Funds: to succeed, you must have patience and a contrarian bent. They arouse a desire for instant gratification. The best time to buy a closed-end country fund is when it’s unpopular and trading at a 20-25% discount to NAV. Drawbacks include a) higher fees and expenses, b) not just companies, the currency must remain strong, and c) government mustn’t ruin the party with extra taxes or regulations that hurt business. Check a) whether the fund manager has worked there, knows people in companies and can follow their stories?) is information disclosure proper, or sketchy and misleading?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Many Stocks Is Too Many?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best to own as many stocks as there are situations in which:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have an edge, and,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve uncovered an exciting prospect that passes all your tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could be one stock or a dozen. There’s no use in diversifying into unknown companies just for diversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, it isn’t safe to own a single stock because, despite your best efforts, the one you choose may be a victim of unforeseen circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In small portfolios. One can be comfortable holding 3-10 stocks. There are several possible benefits:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more stocks you own, the more likely that one of them will 10x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More stocks provide greater flexibility to rotate funds between them. This was an important part of Lynch’s strategy. Some people ascribe his success to having specialized in growth stocks, but that’s only partly accurate. He never put &gt;30-40% into growth stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small investors can follow the Rule of 5 and limit portfolios to 5 stocks. If just one becomes 10x, and the other four go nowhere, the portfolio becomes 3x. o You can have a paper portfolio with 10- 15 stocks that you actively research and own 5 or 6 that you judge to be attractive. This will be great practice; you’ll learn your strengths and weaknesses and in what areas of the economy you’ve better skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The practice of buying, selling &amp;#x26; forget, in a long string of companies isn’t likely to succeed. Investors want to put their old stocks out of their minds because it invokes a painful memory. With a stock you once owned, especially if it went up after selling, it’s human nature to avoid looking at its quote. You must train yourself to overcome this phobia. Think of investments not as discontinued events but as continuing sagas, which need to be rechecked from time to time. Unless a company goes bankrupt, the story is never over. To keep up with old favourites, keep a large notebook in which you record important details from company reports &amp;#x26; reasons why you decided to buy/hold the last time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t pick a new and different company. Otherwise, you’ll end up with too many stocks and won’t remember why you bought them. Getting involved with a manageable number of companies and confining your buy/sell to these is not a bad strategy. Inevitably, some gloomy scenario will cause a general retreat in the stock market, your old favourites will once again become bargains, and you can add to your investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If all stocks went up at the same rate, there would be nothing left to buy, and investors everywhere would be out of business. Fortunately, this is not the case. There’s always a laggard to fall back on once you’ve sold a stock that’s gotten ahead of itself. o Magellan owned 1400 stocks, of which 50% of AUM was in the top 100 stocks, 2/3rd in the top 200 and 1% spread over 500 secondary stocks that were monitored periodically, with the possibility of tuning in later. If something happened to a secondary stock to bolster confidence, it got promoted to a primary selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favourable Company Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Sounds Dull or Ridiculous – simple business with a boring name. More boring, the better. No analysts recommend such names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Does Something Dull – boring name + boring business = keeps Wall street away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Does Something Disagreeable – better than boring = boring + disagreeable. Makes people shrug/retch in disgust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iv) It’s a Spinoff – have strong balance sheets and be well prepared to succeed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spinoffs are misunderstood and get little attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New management can cut costs and take creative measures to improve earnings. Look for insider buying after 1-2 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions dismiss spinoff shares as pocket change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spin-off reports are hastily prepared and are more boring than annual reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fertile area for amateurs, especially during an M&amp;#x26;A frenzy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v) Institutions Don’t Own it and Analysts Don’t Follow It – might frequently happen in many companies’ sectors. Be equally enthusiastic about once-popular stocks that are now abandoned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vi) Rumours Abound – it’s involved with toxic waste or the mafia. Such rumours repel respected investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vii) Something Depressing About It – ex. burial company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;viii) It’s Not a Growth Industry – nothing thrilling about a high-growth industry except seeing the stocks drop. For every single product in a high-growth industry, many others are trying to make it better and cheaper.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This doesn’t happen in a slow-growth industry, where the biggest winners are created since there’s no competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ix) It’s Got a Niche – exclusive franchise, newspaper, cable, brands, rock pits, pharma/chemical patents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;x) People Have to Keep Buying It – Steady business is better than fickle purchases. Drugs/soft drinks/razors/cigarettes &gt; Toys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xi) It’s a User of Technology – ADP benefits from the computer price war vs Dell. Retailer benefits from scanner usage, vs, buying scanner companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xii)Insiders are Buyers – when management owns stock, rewarding owners is prioritized over overpaying salaries or growing at all costs.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, insiders are net sellers. Insider selling ≠ automatic sign of trouble, and it’s silly to react to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many reasons for selling, but only 1 for buying – believe the stock is undervalued if the price drops after insider buying, so much the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xiii) Share Buy-backs – alternative uses for cash include: a) Dividend raise, b) new product development, c) start of new operations, and d) M&amp;#x26;A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xiv) The best place to start looking for the ten-bagger is close to your home. You just need to keep your eyes and mind open. You come across many companies at shopping malls, workplaces, medical test offices, etc. You didn’t have to work at Kodak to know that the new generation of inexpensive, easy-to-use, high-quality cameras would turn the photo industry around. Maybe you work at school and come across a company that is automating the attendance system at school and thus will save hundreds of teachers’ hours. That company is worth researching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stocks to Avoid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Hot Stuff – Avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry. If you aren’t clever at selling, you’ll soon see your profits turn into losses. High growth and hot industries attract smart competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Next Something – when people tout a stock as the next IBM, it often marks the end of prosperity for the imitator and the original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Diworsifications – instead of buybacks/dividends, a dedicated diworsifier seeks purchases that are a) overpriced, and b) beyond the realm of understanding.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every second decade, companies switch between diworsification and restructuring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1960s was the greatest decade for diworseification, which ended in the crash of 1973/74&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synergy (2+2=5): theory of putting together related businesses and making the whole thing work, which doesn’t always happen. A vigorous buyback is the purest synergy of all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iv) Whisper Stocks - long shot companies with whiz-bang stories.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are often on the brink of solving the latest national problem with a solution that’s: a) very imaginative or b) impressively complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The great story has no substance, but it relieves the investor of the burden of checking the financials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If prospects are phenomenal, it will be a fine investment next year. Wait till the company has established a record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v) Beware the Middleman – the company sells a large % of sales (20-50%) to a single customer. Short of order cancellation, that customer has enormous leverage in getting cuts and concessions that reduce profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vi) Beware the Stock with an Exciting Name – the flashy name of a mediocre company attracts investors and gives them a false sense of security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t predict future earnings, at least you can determine how a company plans to increase its earnings. Then you can check periodically to see if the plans are working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five basic ways a company can increase earnings: reduce cost; raise prices. Expand into new markets; sell more of its products in the old markets or to old/existing customers; or revitalize, close, or otherwise dispose of a losing operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With every company, there is something to worry about, but the question is, which worries are valid and which are not? There’s no such thing as a worry-free investment. The trick is to separate the valid worries from the idle worries and then check the worries against the facts. The existence of doubt creates the conditions for a big gain in the stock once the fears are put to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is to put your fears to rest by doing the research &amp;#x26; checking facts – before the competition does. The stocks Lynch bought are the very stocks that others overlooked. The stock market demands convictions as surely as it victimizes the unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the industry that’s surrounded by the most doom &amp;#x26; gloom, &amp;#x26; if fundamentals are positive, you’ll find some big winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases where quiet facts point in a positive direction, a much different story than the negative news being trumpeted, wait until the prevailing theory is that things have gone from bad to worse, then buy the strongest companies. Invest in a company that can survive in a depressed state, rather&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then one that can thrive in boom times but is untested for bad times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The popular prescription “Buy at the sound of cannons &amp;#x26; sell at the sound of trumpets” can be misguided advice. Buying on bad news can be very costly, especially since bad news can get worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying on good news is healthier long term, and you improve your odds considerably by waiting for the proof. Maybe you lose a dollar or so by waiting for the announcement instead of buying the rumour, but if there’s a real deal, it will add many more dollars to the future price. And if there isn’t a real deal, you’ve protected yourself by waiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the short term, the story looks ‘fuzzy,’ and the stock might fall due to uncertainty. It’s best not to own the company during this uncertain stage unless you’re prepared to respond to such a drop by buying more – over the long term, you must be convinced that the company will do well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combat Theory of Investing: During a war, don’t buy the companies that are doing the fighting; buy the ones that sell bullets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industry Bets: an individual can bet heavily on the most promising company and put all his money there, but a fund manager has to spread out his money. 2 ways to do this:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Decide “I want 8% autos” because you have a hunch they’ll do well. The sector pick is deliberate &amp;#x26; companies are incidental.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Analyze each company on a case-by-case basis. The choice of companies is deliberate &amp;#x26; the weighting is incidental.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lynch’s stock picking was entirely empirical. Sniffing from one case to another, like a bloodhound trained to follow a scent. Care more about the details of a story than whether the company’s sector is under/overweighed in the portfolio. Following scents in every direction proves that a little knowledge about a lot of industries isn’t necessarily a dangerous thing. Investment flexibility is key if you’re a bloodhound style. Lynch bought companies with unions and steel/textiles. He always thought there were good opportunities everywhere &amp;#x26; researched stocks himself. Taco Bell was one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of his earliest picks – when people wouldn’t look at a small restaurant company. If you look at ten companies, you’ll find an interesting one. If you look at 20, you’ll find 2, or 10 in 100. The person that turns over the most rocks wins the game – that was always Lynch’s philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than being on the defensive, buying stocks, and then thinking of new excuses for holding onto them (Wall Street style), Lynch stayed on the offensive, searching for better opportunities that were more undervalued than the ones already in the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejecting a stock because the price has become 2-3-4x in the recent past can be a big mistake. Whether a million investors lost or made money on a stock has no bearing on the future. Treat each potential investment as if it had no history – the ‘be here now approach. Whatever occurred earlier is irrelevant. The important thing is whether the stock is cheap/expensive today vs its earnings potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for small companies that are already profitable and have proven that their concept can be replicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be suspicious of companies with 50 to 100 percent growth rates yearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distrust diversifications, which usually turn out to be diworseifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long shots rarely pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s better to miss the first move in a stock and wait to see if a company’s plans are working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People get incredibly valuable fundamental information from their jobs that may not reach the professionals for months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate all stock tips from the tipper, even if the tipper is very smart, very rich, and his or her last tip went up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some stock tips, especially from an expert in the field, may be quite valuable. However, people in the paper industry normally give out tips on drug stocks, and people in the healthcare field never run out of tips on the coming takeovers in the paper industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderately fast growers (20 to 25 percent) in nongrowth industries are ideal investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When purchasing depressed stocks in troubled companies, seek out the ones with superior financial positions and avoid the ones with loads of bank debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that have no debt can’t go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devote at least an hour a week to investment research. Adding up your dividends and figuring out your gains and losses doesn’t count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, tune in later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Rate a Savings &amp;#x26; Loan (S&amp;#x26;L) Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity / Assets – measures financial strength and survivability. Higher, the better. &amp;#x3C;5x = Danger, 5.5-6x = Average, &gt; 7.5x = Preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book Value – if high-risk lending has been avoided, then assets and book value may accurately reflect net worth. Look for P/B &amp;#x3C; 1x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PE – the lower, the better. If PE = 7x, and growth = 15%, that’s very promising, especially when S&amp;#x26;P 500 PE = 23x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-Risk Assets – get nervous when commercial and construction loans are &gt;5-10% of the lending portfolio since one can’t analyze a commercial lending portfolio from the outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90-Day NPA’s – these have already defaulted. Preferably represent &amp;#x3C;2% of total assets. The trend should be falling. o Dividend – higher yield is a plus when other criteria are met.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real Estate Owned – foreclosed properties are already written off, an index of yesterday’s problems. A high number isn’t worrisome unless it’s on the rise. If there’s a lot of REO, you’ve to assume that the S&amp;#x26;L is having trouble getting rid of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large banks like Citibank may spend 2.5-3% of their entire loan portfolio for overheads and related costs. A good S&amp;#x26;L may break even at 1.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best S&amp;#x26;Ls are no frills, low-cost operators, have a solid base of loyal neighbourhood depositors, are content to make traditional low-cost residential mortgages (&amp;#x3C;$1000k), avoid hiring high-priced credit analysts, have big branches with enormous deposits, which is more profitable than having many small branches, also don’t have expansively furnished headquarters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large banks prize an S&amp;#x26;L with excess equity, loyal deposit base &amp;#x26; lending capacity as a takeover target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an S&amp;#x26;L with a boring story and fortress balance sheet gets in trouble, its competitors are walking the plank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem Loan Camouflaging – approve $120 on a $100 request, using inflated appraisals. Excess $20 is held back in banks’ reserves and used at default to cover interest payments. Helps reclassify bad loans as good, at least temporarily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditionally, an S&amp;#x26;L is owned cooperatively and has no shareholders. Net worth belongs to all who have accounts in branches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As long as the cooperative form of ownership is maintained, you get nothing for your stake. Things change when it comes to an IPO:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) The Directors, who put together the deal, and the stock buyers, are on the same side. Directors will buy shares, so the IPO price is set low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Depositors &amp;#x26; Directors can buy at the IPO price. Because depositors own cooperatives, it’s inconvenient to divvy IPO proceeds among many sellers, also buyers. Instead, the money becomes a part of equity &amp;#x26; goes back to the S&amp;#x26;L rather than going into the promoters’ pocket. Pre-IPO Book Value = $10. Further $10 shares sold, but proceeds are added back, so Post-IPO Equity = $20. Therefore, $10 share price &amp;#x3C; $20 book value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master Limited Partnerships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MLP holder needs to do some extra paperwork. Special tax forms have to be prepared. Once a year, you get a letter asking for confirmation about how many shares you bought and owned. But this is nuisance enough to dissuade investors, especially fund managers, from buying them. This lack of popularity helps keep prices down and creates bargains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies tend to be involved in down-to-earth activities. An imaginative person is attracted to owning shares in an MLP. Then he runs into paperwork, which most imaginative people can’t stand. Therefore, a small minority of imaginative people with retentive qualities are left to reap the rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An MLP distributes all its earnings as dividends, which are unusually high, almost as good as junk bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high PE ratio is fairly common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before buying stocks, make some basic decisions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) About the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) About how much you trust companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) about whether you need to invest in stocks &amp;#x26; what you expect from them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iv) about whether you’re a short or, long-term investor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v) about how you will react to sudden unexpected, and severe price drops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define your objectives and clarify your attitude beforehand (do I think stocks are safer than bonds?). If you’re undecided and lack conviction, you’re a potential market victim who abandons all hope and reason at the worst moment &amp;#x26; sells at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you invest in stocks, you’ve to have a basic faith in human nature, capitalism, the country &amp;#x26; future prosperity in general&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I Own a House?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before stocks, consider buying a house. It’s the one good investment decision that almost everyone makes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike stocks, houses are likely to be held by the same person for many years, vs a high stock churn rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You never get scared out of your house because of price falls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People spend months choosing a house and asking the right questions but pick stocks in a few minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I Need the Money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set aside cash for 2-3 years per your family budget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the money you want to invest in stocks should be truly surplus. For instance, if you have to pay for a child’s college education in 2 or 3 years, don’t put that money into stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I Have the Personal Qualities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-reliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerance for pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open-mindedness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detachment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness to do independent research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness to admit mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to ignore general panic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Important to make decisions without complete or perfect information. Things are never clear. When they are, it’s too late to profit from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s crucial to be able to resist your human nature &amp;#x26; gut feelings. Only a rare investor doesn’t secretly harbour the belief that he can divine prices, even though most of us have been proven wrong again &amp;#x26; again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people discover they’re no good at sports, they give up, but when they discover they’re no good at stock picking, they continue anyway. Be open mind to new ideas. If you don’t think you can beat the market, then buy mutual funds &amp;#x26; save yourself extra work &amp;#x26; money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with Price Drops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best time to buy stocks will always be the day you’ve convinced yourself you’ve found solid merchandise at a good price – the same as at the mall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps there’s some poetic justice in that stocks that take you the farthest, in the long run, give you the most bumps and bruises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small investors can handle all sorts of markets as long as they own good merchandise. After all, market crashes are only losses to people who took the losses. That isn’t the long-term investor. It’s the margin player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s not much you can do when the market’s in a cascade. 1987 wasn’t analyzed very well. You’ve to put it in perspective. 1982, the market’s 777. By 1986, the market moves to 1700. Then it adds 1,000 points, reaching 2,700 by Aug ‘87. Then it falls 1,000 points in 2 months, 500 points on the last day. So if the market went sideways at 1,700, no one would’ve worried, but it went up 1,000 in 10 months &amp;#x26; then down 1,000 in 2 months, and people said, “The world’s over.” It was the same price. So it was a question of the market just kept going up and up, and it just went to such an incredibly high price, but people forget that it was unchanged for one year. It’d gone 1,000 points up, then 1,000 points down, and they only remember the down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get recessions, and you have market declines. If you don’t understand what’s going to happen, you’re not ready – you won’t do well in the markets. If you go to Minnesota in January, you should know that it’s gonna be cold. You don’t panic when the thermometer falls &amp;#x3C;0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can summon the courage &amp;#x26; presence of mind to buy during scary periods that occur every few years when your stomach says sell, you’ll find&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;opportunities that you never thought you’d ever see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can’t convince yourself, “When I’m down 25%, I’m a buyer”, and banish forever the thought “When I’m down 25%, I’m a seller”, then you’ll never&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make a decent profit in stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimate success or failure depends on your ability to ignore the world’s worries long enough to allow your investments to succeed. It isn’t the head but the stomach that determines the stock picker’s fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how intelligent, the skittish investor is always susceptible to getting flushed out of the market by the brush beaters of the doom. Experience is always an expensive teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the indices hit new records, many small companies may be ignored. That’s not to say owning these laggards will protect you if the bottom drops out of the market. If that happens, the stocks that didn’t go up will go down just as hard &amp;#x26; fast as the stocks that did. Before the selling is over, companies that look cheap get much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Even Bigger Picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s simple to tell yourself, “Gee, I guess I’ll ignore the bad news the next time the stock market is going down and pick up some bargains.” But since each crisis seems worst than the last, ignoring bad news gets harder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular systematic investing is the best way to avoid getting scared out of stocks. If you don’t buy with monthly discipline, you’ve got to find some way to keep the faith. Without faith, you may invest in a good fund, but you’ll sell at the point of maximum fear, i.e., at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What sort of faith? Faith that the country will survive, that people will go to work, that the companies they work for will make money, that as old companies lose momentum, new exciting companies will emerge to take their place, and that the country is a nation of hardworking and creative people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you’re concerned about the Current Big Picture, concentrate on the Even Bigger Picture. This tells us that over the last 70 years, stocks have returned 10.3% vs 4.8% for bonds. Despite all the great &amp;#x26; minor calamities that occurred in the last century, stocks have been rewarded 2x. Acting on this bit of information is more lucrative than acting on the opinions of commentators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;predicting the coming depression. o These 70 years have seen 40 scary declines of &gt;10%, of which 13 were &gt;33%, including the 1929-33 selloff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scare Proofing Drill – concentrate on the Even Bigger picture during scary periods, assuming that the worst wouldn’t happen, and then ask yourself,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if it didn’t, what then? Things can only get better than they are. Investors’ attempt to prepare for total disaster by bailing out of their best investments is stupid: a) If total disaster strikes, cash in the bank would be as useless as stocks. b) If it doesn’t strike (much more likely outcome), the cautious types have just become reckless, selling their valuable assets for a pittance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you sell in desperation, you always sell cheap – you should ignore the market ups &amp;#x26; downs. Even if the 1987 crash made you nervous about the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;market, you didn’t have to sell that day or the next. You could’ve gradually reduced your stocks and come out ahead of the panic sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watering the Weeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people automatically sell winners and hold onto the losers, which is about as sensible as pulling out flowers and watering the weeds. Others sell their losers and hold onto winners, which doesn’t work out much better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both strategies fail because they’re tied to the current price movements as an indicator of a company’s value. Price tells us nothing about prospects, and it occasionally moves in the opposite direction of fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A better strategy is to rotate in and out of stocks depending on what has happened to the price, as it relates to the story. E.g. If a Stalwart rises 40% and nothing wonderful has happened with the company to make you think that there are wonderful surprises ahead, replace it with another Stalwart you find attractive that hasn’t gone up. In the same situation, if you didn’t want to sell all of it, you could sell some of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A price drop in a good stock is only a tragedy if you sell at that price and never buy more. A price drop is an opportunity to load up on bargains from among your worst performers and laggards that show promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can someone complain after selling a stock at 5x? When you’ve found the right stock and bought it, all the evidence tells you it’s going higher, and everything is working in your favour, then it’s a shame if you sell a 25x for 5x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignore others in favour of your research. Investing ≠ in surgery/hairdressing/plumbing. The smart money isn’t smart, and the dumb money isn’t as dumb as it thinks. It’s only dumb when it listens to smart money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferiority complex causes investors to do 1 of 3 self-destructive things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Imitate the pros by buying “hot” stocks or trying to “catch the turn” in, say, IBM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Become “sophisticated” by investing in futures, options, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Buy what a pro has recommended in a magazine or on the news. Information is so readily available that the celebrity tip has replaced the old-fashioned tip from Uncle Harry as the most compelling reason to invest in a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Double Edge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil executive’s knowledge about his industry ≠ consumer knowledge about brands. What do you possibly know that other people don’t know a lot better? If nothing, then your edge is = 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional’s edge is useful in knowing when and when not to buy companies that have been around for a while, especially Cyclicals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On top of the professional’s edge is the consumer’s edge. This helps pick out the winners from the newer and smaller fast-growing companies,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;especially in retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True contrarian does not take the opposite view of a popular hot issue. The true contrarian waits for things to cool down &amp;#x26; buys stocks that nobody cares about, especially those that make Wall Street yawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penultimate Preparedness: no matter how we arrive at the latest conclusion, we always seem to be preparing ourselves for the last thing that happened vs what’s going to happen next. This extrapolation is our way of making up for the fact that we didn’t see the last thing coming along in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drumbeat Effect – a particularly ominous message is repeated repeatedly until it’s impossible to get away from it. Friends, relatives, brokers etc., whisper in your ears. You might get the “congratulations, don’t be greedy” message on a particular stock. Most of the drumbeat messages revolve around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;macroeconomic or political issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest trouble with stock market advice is that good or bad, it stocks to your brain. Every dumb idea you hear about stocks will get into your brain. You can’t get it out of your head, and someday, sometime, you’ll find yourself reacting to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stock doesn’t know that you own it. When Lynch ran Magellan, the market had nine declines of &gt;10% in 13 years. He had a perfect record. All nine times, his fund went down. He didn’t spend time predicting the economy or the stock market – he spent all his time looking at companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Playing the Market’ has done more damage to investing than anyone can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you said you were an investment manager, people would move on to the next topic. That was sort of the attitude in the ’60s and ’70s. As the market started to heat up, you’d say you were an investor, “That’s interesting. Are there any stocks you’re buying?” Then people would listen not avidly but think about it. But then, as the ’80s piled on, they started writing things down. So people would take an interest, “What do you like?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it turned &amp;#x26; the final page of the chapter would be you’d be at a party, and everybody would be talking about stocks, &amp;#x26; then people would recommend stocks. And not only that, but the stocks would go up over the next three months. So you’ve done the full cycle of speculation that people hate
stocks; don’t want to hear anything about them; now they’re buying everything; &amp;#x26; cabbies are giving stock tips. That was the cycle going through from the ’60s &amp;#x26; early ’70s to 1987.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold is about sentiment &amp;#x26; psychology, much more so than any other commodity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;stock-classification-system&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#stock-classification-system&quot; aria-label=&quot;stock classification system permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;STOCK CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, categorize a company by size. Large companies cannot be expected to grow as quickly as smaller companies. Big companies have small moves, small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;companies have big moves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, categorize a company by its “story” type. If you can’t figure out a company’s story category, then ask around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorizing stocks allows you to set the right expectations from an investment, guiding your future actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t hold onto a Stalwart after it’s 2x. Hoping for 10x. If you buy a great Stalwart for a good price, you may forget about it for 20 years, but you can’t do so with a Cyclical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct categorization also lets you know the company’s possible future trajectory, providing an efficient checklist to gauge its performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utility can’t beat Stalwart if it’s not a Turnaround. No point in trading a Fast Grower as a Stalwart and selling for a 50% gain vs a possible 10x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you’ve taken the first step of doing proper research, spreading money among several categories is another way to minimize downside risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;companies don’t stay in the same category forever. High-growth companies cannot maintain double-digit growth forever. Fast-growing companies will become stalwarts and slow growers and may go so far down that they become turnaround candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually large and aging companies, whose Growth rate = GNP (gross national product). Growth rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When industries slow down, most companies lose momentum as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to spot using stock charts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay large and regular dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bladder theory of corporate finance: the more cash that builds up in the treasury, the greater the pressure to piss it away. Companies that don’t pay dividends have a history of diworseification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks that pay dividends are favoured vs stocks that don’t. Dividends create a floor price, keeping stock from falling away during market crashes. Investors who know that the high dividend yield will hold up will buy for the dividend. This is one reason to buy Slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growers and Stalwarts, since people flock to blue chips during the panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a Slow Grower stops dividends, you’re stuck with a sluggish company with little going for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GE, Alcoa, Utilities, Dow Chemical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure jobs + Low salary + Modest raises = Librarians, Teachers, Policemen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PE Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lowest levels, per PEG. Utilities = 7-9x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bargain hunting doesn’t make sense without growth or other catalysts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During bull market optimism, PE may expand to Fast Growers’ PE of 14-20x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, the only meaningful source of return = PE re-rating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Minute Drill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasons for interest?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What must happen for the company to succeed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pitfalls that stand in the path?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend Play = “For the past ten years, the company has increased earnings, offers an attractive dividend yield, it’s never reduced/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suspended dividend &amp;#x26; has raised it during good and bad times, including the last three recessions. As a phone utility, the new cellular division may aid growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividends: Check if always paid and raised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low dividend payout ratio creates a cushion. A higher % is riskier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio Allocation %&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0% - NO Allocation, because without growth, the earnings &amp;#x26; price aren’t going to move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk/Reward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low risk-Low gain because Slow Growers aren’t expected to do much and are priced accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell When&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 30-50% rise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When fundamentals deteriorate, even if the price has fallen:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lost market share for 2 Quarters and hired a new advertising agency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No new products/R&amp;#x26;D, indicating that the company is resting on its laurels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diworseification (&gt;2 recent unrelated M&amp;#x26;A’s), excess leverage leaves no room for buybacks/dividend increase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend yield isn’t high enough, even at a lower price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local edge is useful since Wall Street ignores/overlooks valuable assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;business with assets, whether cash, investments, properties, machines, etc., is worth more than the price you will pay for the stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Railroads, TV stations, minerals, oil &amp;#x26; gas, timber, newspapers, real estate, depreciation on assets that appreciate over time, patents, cash, subsidiary valuations, foreign owner priced cheaper than a local subsidiary, tax loss carry forwards, goodwill amortization, brands, holding company/conglomerate discount, depreciated assets that don’t need maintenance capex but still produce FCF (rental equipment EPS = 0, but FCF =3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never do wells, trust fund men, squires, bon vivants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live off family fortunes but never labour – the issue is what will be left after payments for travel, liquor, creditors etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PE Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 2-5x is the expected return, then the entry point for P/NAV = 20-50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Minute Drill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the assets, and what’s their worth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock = $8, but video cassette division = $4 and Real Estate = $7. That is a bargain, and the rest of the company = ($3). Insiders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are buying, and the company has steady earnings. There is no debt to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAV? Any hidden assets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt – does leverage detract from asset value? Is new debt being added?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catalyst – how will value get unlocked? Raider/activist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio Allocation %&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0% - NO Allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk/Reward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Risk – High Gain, IF you’re sure that NAV = 2-5x current price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If wrong, you probably don’t lose much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a company isn’t going on a debt binge and reducing NAV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell When&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catalyst occurs – without raider/catalyst, you may sit for ages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although the share sell at a discount to real market value, management has announced it will issue 10 percent more shares to help finance a diversification program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutional ownership rises to 60% from 25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of a subsidiary selling for $100, it sells for $60 - the calculated NAV may be inflated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax rate deduction reduces the value of tax loss carry forwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-stalwarts&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3-stalwarts&quot; aria-label=&quot;3 stalwarts permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3) STALWARTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth rate = 2x GNP growth rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth Rates: Slow Growers (1x GNP) &amp;#x3C; Stalwarts (2x GNP) &amp;#x3C; Fast Growers (20-25%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fairly large-sized companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can profit based on time and price of purchase. Long-term return will be = bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good performers, but not stars – 50% return in 2 years is a delightful result. Sell more readily than Fast Growers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good performers in good markets. Take 30- 50% returns, then rotate money into another Stalwart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating performance of such defensives helps them survive recessions. No down quarter for 20-30 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer good protection in hard times. Won’t go bankrupt. Soon enough, they’ll be reassessed, and their value will be restored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t hold after 2x. Hoping for 10x. It could hold for 20 years only if you bought a “Great” company at a “Good” price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can hardly go wrong by making a full portfolio of companies that have raised dividends for 10-20 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden assets like brands &amp;#x26; patents grow larger while the company punishes P&amp;#x26;L EPS via amortization, R&amp;#x26;D, branding etc. EPS will jump when these expenses stop, or the new product hits the market.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to these hidden assets and low maintenance CAPEX, FCF &gt; EPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible to cut costs, raise prices and capture market share in slow-growth markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can find a company that can raise prices without losing customers, you’ve found a terrific investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pharma, Tobacco, FMCG, Alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people will continue to eat cornflakes during a recession, and thus Kellogg will grow steadily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command good salaries and get predictable raises – mid-level employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PE Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average = 10-14x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PEG &amp;#x3C;0.5-1x is fine, but 2x is expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Minute Drill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key issues are PE, recent price run-ups, and what, if anything, is happening to accentuate the growth rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coke is selling at the low end of its PE range. The stock hasn’t gone anywhere for two years, even though the company has improved in many&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ways. Sold 50% of Columbia Pictures. Diet drinks have dramatically sped up the growth rate. Foreign sales are excellent. Has better
control over sales &amp;#x26; distribution after buying out many independent, regional distributors. Thus, it may do better than people think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price = key issue, since these are big companies that aren’t likely to go out of business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversification – capital misallocation may reduce future earnings. The Board of Directors is better off returning cash to shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-Term Growth Rate – has the company kept up with growth rate momentum in recent years? Is it slowing/speeding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-Term Holding – how did it fare during previous recessions/market corrections?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check for unrelated acquisitions that may reduce earnings in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio Allocation %&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-20% Allocation to moderate risks in a portfolio full of Fast Growers and Turnarounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average 20% Allocation in a personal investor’s 10-stock portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk/Reward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Risk – Moderate Gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-year holding may give a 50% upside vs 20% downside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 rotations of 25-30% CAGR Stalwarts = 4-5x, or 1 big winner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell When&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stalwarts with heavy institutional ownership and lots of Wall Street coverage that have outperformed the market and are overpriced,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are due for a rest or decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10x is not possible. If P&gt;E or PE&gt;Normal, sell and rotate. If Price gets ahead, but the story is still the same, sell and rotate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New products of the last two years have mixed results &amp;#x26; new testing products are &gt; 1 year away from market launch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PE = 15x, vs similar quality company from the same industry at 11-12x PE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Executive/CXO/Director has bought shares in the last year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large division (&gt;25% of sales) is vulnerable to an ongoing economic slump (housing, oil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth rate is slowing down, and though earnings have been maintained via cost cuts, there’s no further room left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No growth, potential fatalities – a poorly managed company is a candidate for trouble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make up lost ground very quickly, and performance isn’t related to market moves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can’t compile a list of failed Turnarounds since their records get deleted after the collapse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turnaround types:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Bail Us Out Or Else: whole deal depends on a government bailout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Who Would’ve Thought: can lose money in utilities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Unanticipated Problem: minor tragedy perceived to be worse, leading to major opportunity. Be patient. Keep up with the news. Read it with dispassion. Stay away from tragedies where the outcome is immeasurable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iv) Good Company Inside a Bad one: possible bankruptcy spinoff. Look for institutional selling and insider buying. Did the parent strengthen the company’s balance sheet pre-spinoff?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v) Restructuring: company diworseified earlier, and now the loss-making business is being sold off, costs cut etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will earnings change?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Lower costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Higher prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Expansion into new markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iv) Higher volume sold in old markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v) Changes in loss-making operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy companies with superior financial conditions. Young company + Heavy Debt = Higher Risk. Determine the extent of leverage and what kind it is. Long-term funded debt is preferable to Short/Medium term callable bank debt, which may trigger bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inventory growth &gt; Sales growth = Red flag, &amp;#x26; inventory growth is a bad sign. Depleting inventory means things maybe turn positive. High inventory build-up overstates earnings - may mean that management is deferring losses by not marking down the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;unsold items &amp;#x26; getting rid of them quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset/inventory values may be inflated. Raw materials are liquidated better than finished goods. Check for pension liabilities and capitalized interest expense in asset values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upswing favours Turnarounds &gt; Normal companies. So look for low-margin companies to succeed via operating leverage / high cost of production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the industry is robust in general and the company’s business doesn’t do well, one may be pessimistic about its future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the entire industry is in a slump &amp;#x26; due for a rebound, &amp;#x26; the company has strengthened its balance sheet and is close to the breakeven point, then it has the potential to make jumbo sales when the industry picks up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name changes may happen due to M&amp;#x26;A or some fiasco they hope will be forgotten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are Turnarounds obvious winners? In hindsight, a company doesn’t tell you to buy it. There’s always something to worry about. There are always respected investors who say that you’re wrong. You must know the story better than they do and believe in what you know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a stock to do better than expected, it has to be widely underestimated. Otherwise, it’d sell for a higher price, to begin with. When&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the prevailing opinion is more negative than yours, you’ve to constantly check &amp;#x26; re-check the facts to assure yourself that you’re not
being foolishly optimistic. The story keeps changing for better or worse, and you must follow these changes and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Turnarounds, Wall Street will ignore changes. The Old company had such a powerful impression that people couldn’t see&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the New one. Even if you don’t see it immediately, you can still profit more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclicals with serious financial problems collapse into Turnarounds. Also, fast growers diversify &amp;#x26; fall out of favour. If Slow Grower = Turnaround, then its performance maybe &gt; Stalwart/Fast Grower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remind yourself of the Even Bigger Picture – that stocks in good companies are worth owning. What’s the worst that can happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does recession turn into depression? Then interest rates will fall, competitors will falter etc. if things go right, how much can I earn? What’s the reward side of the equation? Take the industry which is surrounded by the most doom and gloom. If the fundamentals are positive, you’ll find some big winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto (Ford Chrysler), paper, airlines (Lockheed), steel, electronics, non-ferrous metals, real estate, oil &amp;#x26; gas, retail, Penn Central, General Utilities, Con Edison, Toys R Us spinoff, Union Carbide, Goodyear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record with troubled utilities is better than troubled companies because of regulations. A utility may cancel dividends / declare bankruptcy, but if people depend on it, a way must be found to let it continue functioning. Regulation determines prices, and profits, passing on costs to customers. Since the government has a vested interest in its survival, the odds are overwhelming that it will be allowed to overcome its problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Troubled Utility Cycle:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Disaster Strikes: some huge cost (fuel) can’t be passed along because a huge asset is mothballed &amp;#x26; removed from the base rate. Stock drops 40-80% in 1-2 years, horrifying people who view utilities as safe &amp;#x26; stable investments. Soon, it starts trading at 20-30% P/B. Wall Street is worried about fatal damage – how long it takes to reverse this impression varies. 30% P/B implies bankruptcy, which may take up to 4 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Crisis Management: utility attempts to respond by cutting costs and CAPEX. Dividends may be decreased/eliminated. It looks like the company will survive, but the price doesn’t reflect the improved prospects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Financial Stabilization: cost cuts have succeeded, allowing it to operate on current revenues. Capital markets may be unwilling to lend money for new projects &amp;#x26; it’s still not earning money for owners, but survival isn’t in doubt. Prices recover to 60-70% P/B, 2x from stage (i), (ii)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iv) Recovery At Last: once again capable of earning, Wall Street has reason to expect improved earnings and the reinstatement of dividends. P/B = 1x. How things progress from here depends on (a) reception from capital markets because without capital, a utility cannot increase its base rates, and (b) support from regulators’, i.e., how many costs are allowed to be passed on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One person’s distress is another man’s opportunity. You don’t need to rush into troubled utilities to make large profits. Can wait until the crisis has abated, doomsayers are proven wrong, and still, make 2-4x in the short term. Buy on the omission of dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x26; wait for the good news. Or buy when the first good news has arrived in stage (ii).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem that some people have is they think they’ve missed it if the stock falls to $4, then rebounds to $8. A troubled company has a long way to go, and you must forget that you’ve missed the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guttersnipes, drifters, down and outers, bankrupts, unemployed – if there’s energy and enterprise left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Minute Drill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the company gone about improving its fortunes, and is the plan working?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Mills has made great progress on diversification. Cut down from 11 to 2 businesses that are key and the company does best. Others were sold at a good price, and the cash was used for buybacks. One key business’ market share has improved from 7 to 25%, and is coming up with new products. Earnings are up sharply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan – how will it turn around? Sell loss-making subsidiaries? Cut costs? What’s the impact of these actions? Is business coming back? New products?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survival – can it survive a raid by short-term creditors? Check cash/debt position and capital structure. Can it sustain more losses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottom Fishing – if it’s bankrupt already, what’s left for owners?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio Allocation %&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20-50% Allocation, based on where greater value exists - Turnarounds or Fast Growers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk/Reward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Risk – High Gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher potential upside (10x) vs higher potential downside (100% loss).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell When&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Turnaround is complete, trouble is over, everyone is aware of the changed situation, &amp;#x26; the company is re-classified as a Cyclical/Fast/Slow Grower etc. Stockholders aren’t embarrassed to own the shares anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock is judged to be a 2x, but not 5-10x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PE is inflated vs Earnings prospects. Sell and rotate into juicier Turnaround opportunities, where Fundamentals are better than Price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt, which has declined for five consecutive quarters, rises again. Indicates increased chances of relapse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inventory rise &gt; 2x Sales increase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50% of sales of the company’s strongest division’ come from some customers whose sales are slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-cyclicals&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5-cyclicals&quot; aria-label=&quot;5 cyclicals permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5) CYCLICALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales and profits rise and fall in regular, if not completely regular, fashion as the business expands and contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timing is everything. Coming out of recession into a vigorous economy, they flourish more than Stalwarts. In the opposite direction, they can lose &gt;50% very quickly and may take years before another upswing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most misunderstood type, investors can lose money in safe stocks. Large Cyclicals are falsely classified as Stalwarts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a defensive Stalwart loses 50% in a slump, then Cyclicals may lose 80%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s much easier to predict an upswing, vs, a downturn, so one has to detect early signs of business changes. You get a working edge if you’re in the same industry – to be used to your advantage. Most important in Cyclicals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unreliable dividend payers. If they’ve financial problems, then they become potential Turnaround candidates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inventory build-up = bad sign. Inventory growth &gt; Sales growth = red flag. Inventory build-up with companies having fluctuating end-product pricing causes larger problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor inventory to figure out the business direction. If an inventory depletes in a depressed company, it’s the first evidence of a possible business turnaround.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Operating Profit Margin (OPM) = Lowest Cost producer with a better chance of survival if business conditions deteriorate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upswing favours companies with Low OPMs. Therefore, you want to hold relatively High OPM companies for the long term and play relatively Low OPM companies for successful Turnarounds/cycle turns. The best time to get involved with Cyclicals is when the economy is at its weakest, earnings are at their lowest, and public sentiment is at its bleakest. Even though Cyclicals have rebounded in the same way eight times since WWII, buying them in the early stages of an economic recovery is never easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every recession brings out skeptics who doubt that we will ever come out of it, who predict depression and the country going bankrupt. If there’s any time not to own Cyclicals, it’s in a depression. “This one is different” is the doomsayer’s litany, and every recession is different, but that doesn’t mean it will ruin us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever there was a recession, Lynch paid attention to them. Since he always thought positively and assumed that the economy would improve, he was willing to invest in Cyclicals at their nadir. Things begin to get better when it seems it can’t get any worse. A comeback of depressed Cyclicals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with strong balance sheets is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclicals lead the market higher at the end of a recession – how frequently today’s mountains turn into tomorrow’s molehills, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclicals are like blackjack: stay in the game too long, and it’s bound to take back all your profits. Things can go from good to worse very quickly, and it’s important to get out at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As business goes from lousy to mediocre, investors in Cyclicals can make money; as it goes from mediocre to good, they can make money; from good to excellent, they may make a little more money, though not as much as before. When a business goes from excellent back to good, investors begin to lose; from good to mediocre, they lose more; and from mediocre to lousy, they’re back where they started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you have to know where we are in the cycle. But it’s not quite as simple as it sounds. Investing in Cyclicals has become a game of anticipation, making it doubly hard to make money. Large institutions try to jump on competitors by buying Cyclicals before showing any signs of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lead to false starts when stock prices run up and then fall back with each contradictory statistic (we’re recovering, we’re not recovering).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal danger is that you buy too early, then get discouraged, and sell. To succeed, you’ve to have some way of tracking the fundamentals of the industry and the company. Investing is perilous without the working knowledge of the industry and its rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timing the cycle is only half the battle. The other half is picking companies that will gain the Most from an upturn. If Industry picks = Right, but Company pick = Wrong, you can lose money just as easily as if you were wrong about the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If investing in a troubled industry, buy companies with staying power. Also, wait for signs of revival. Some troubled industries never came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sell at 2x, you won’t get 10x. If the original story is intact or improving, stick around to see what happens, and you’ll be amazed at the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto, airlines, steel, tyres, chemicals, aerospace &amp;#x26; defence, non-ferrous metals, nursing, lodging, oil &amp;#x26; gas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autos: 3-4 up years, after 3-4 down years. Worse Slump = Better Recovery. An extra bad year brings a longer and more sustainable upside. People will eventually replace their cars, even if put off for 1-2 years.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Units of pent-up demand – compare Actual Sales vs Trend, i.e., an estimate of how many units should’ve been sold based on demographics, previous year sales, age of cars on the road etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1980-83 = sluggish economy + people saving up, therefore pent up demand = 7mm. 1984-89 boom, sales exceeded the trendline by 7.8mm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 4-5 years below trend, it takes another 4-5 years above trend before the car market can catch up to itself. You might sell your auto stocks too soon if you didn’t know this. After 1983, sales increased from 5mm to 12.3mm, and you might sell, fearing the boom was over. But if you follow the trend, you’d know the pent-up demand was 7mm, which wasn’t exhausted until 1988, which was the year to sell your auto stocks since pent-up demand from the early ’80s got used up. Even though 1989 was a good year, units sold fell by 1mm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the industry had five good years, it’s somewhere in the middle of the cycle. Can predict an upturn, not a downturn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrysler EPS for 1988, ’89, ’90 &amp;#x26; ’91 was $4.7, $11.0, $0.3 &amp;#x26; Loss, respectively. Worry that the stock is floating on fantasy when your best case is worse than everyone’s worst case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At one point, high yield Utilities were 10% of Magellan’s AUM. This usually happened when interest rates were declining, and the economy was in a splutter. Therefore, treat Utilities as interest rate Cyclicals and time entry and exit accordingly. It can also treat Fannie / NBFCs as interest rate Cyclicals benefitting from rate cuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Gold Rush, people selling picks and shovels did better than the miners. When mutual funds are popular, investing in the fund companies is more rewarding than putting money into their funds. When interest rates are falling, bond &amp;#x26; equity funds attract the most cash. Money market funds prosper when rates rise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In US /Europe insurance companies, the rates go up months before earnings show any improvement. You can make a lot of money if you buy when the rates first begin to rise. It’s not uncommon for a stock to become 2x after a rate increase and another 2x on the higher earnings that result from a rate increase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make all their money in short bursts, then try to budget it through long, unprofitable stretches. Farmers, resort employees, camp operators, writers, and actors. Some may also become Fast Growers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PE Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow Growers (7-9x) &amp;#x3C; Cyclicals (7-20x) &amp;#x3C; Fast Growers (14-20x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assigning PE’s: Peak EPS (3-4x) &amp;#x3C; Decent EPS (5-8x) &amp;#x3C; Average EPS (8-10x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock Pattern: 1990 EPS = $6.5, Price Range = $23 - $36, PE Range = 3.6-5.5x. 1991 EPS = $3.9, Price drops to $26. PE = 6.7x, higher than the previous year’s PE, which had higher EPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Low PE is good with most stocks but not with Cyclicals. When Low, it’s usually a sign that they are at the end of a prosperous interlude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unwary investors hold onto their shares since business is still good &amp;#x26; the company continues to show higher earnings, but this will change soon. Smart investors sell their shares early to avoid the rush.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a large crowd begins to sell, the Price and PE drop, making a Cyclical more attractive to the uninitiated. This can be an expensive misconception. Soon, the economy will falter, and earnings will decline at a  breathtaking speed. As more investors head for the exit, the price will plummet. Buying Cyclicals after years of record earnings and when PE has hit a low point is a proven method to lose ~50% in a short time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, a High PE may be good news for a Cyclical. Often, it means that a company is passing through the worst of the doldrums, and soon its business will improve, earnings will exceed expectations, and investors will start buying the stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Minute Drill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Script revolves around business conditions, inventories and prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s been a 3-year slump in autos, but things have turned around this year. I know that because car sales are up for the first time in recent memory. GM’s new models are selling well, and in the last 18 months, GM closed down five inefficient plants, cut 20% of labour, and earnings are about to turn higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inventories: keep a close eye on inventory levels, changes, and the supply &amp;#x26; demand relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competition: new entrants / added supply = dangerous development because they may cut prices to capture market share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know your Cyclicals: if you do, you have an advantage in figuring things out and timing the cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance Sheet: strong enough to survive the next downturn? Can it outlast competitors? Is CAPEX on upgradation/expansion a cause for concern? How much of a drag is it on FCF? Is CF &gt; Capex, even in bad years? Are plants &amp;#x26; machinery in good shape?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anticipate a shrinking p/e multiple over time as business recovers and investors look ahead to the end of the cycle when peak earnings are achieved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio Allocation %&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-20% Allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk/Reward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Risk – High Gain; or High Risk – Low Gain, depending on investor adeptness at anticipating cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+10x / (80-90% loss)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get out of situations where Price overtakes Fundamentals and rotate into Fundamentals &gt; Price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell When&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand strange rules to play the game successfully because Cyclicals are tricky. Sell towards the end of the cycle, but who knows when that is? Who even knows what cycles they’re talking about? Sometimes, the knowledgeable vanguard sells one year before any signs of decline, so the price falls for no apparent reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever inspired you to buy after the last bust will help convince you that the latest boom is over. If you have enough of an edge to buy in the first place, you’ll notice changes in business and price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company spends on new technological expansion instead of cheaper expenditures on modernizing old plants. Sell when something has gone wrong. Rising costs, 100% utilization but spending on capacity expansion, labour asks for increased wages, which were cut in the previous bust etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final product demand slows down. Inventory builds up, and the company can’t get rid of it. If storage is full of finished goods, you may already be late in selling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falling commodity prices, Futures &amp;#x3C; Spot Price. Oil and steel prices turn lower much earlier than the EPS impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong competition for market share leads to price cuts. The company tries cost cuts but can’t compete against cheap imports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small, aggressive new companies. Growing at 20-25%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land of the 10-40x, even 200x. 1-2 such companies can make a career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lousy Industry
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May not belong to a fast-growing industry. Can expand in the room in a slow growth industry by taking market share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depressed industries are likely places to find potential bargains. If business improves from lousy to mediocre, you are rewarded again when mediocre turns to good and good to excellent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moderately fast growers (20-25%) in slow-growth industries are ideal investments. Look for companies with niches that can capture market share without price competition. In business, competition is never as healthy as total domination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth ≠ Expansion, leading people to overlook great companies like Phillip Morris. Industry-wide cigarette consumption may decline, but companies can increase earnings by cost cuts and price increases. Earnings growth is the only growth that counts. If costs rise 4%, but prices rise 6%, and profit margin is 10%, then extra 2% price rise = 20% increase in earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greatest companies in lousy industries share certain characteristics:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) low-cost operators / penny pinchers in the executive suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) avoid leverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) reject corporate hierarchies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iv) workers are well paid and have a stake in the company’s future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v) they find niches, parts of the market that bigger companies overlook. Zero Growth Industry = Zero Competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot Industry
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot Stocks + Hot Industry = Greater Competition. Companies can thrive only due to niche/moat/patents etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth ≠ Expansion. In low-growth industries, companies expand by capturing market share, cutting costs and raising prices. When an industry gets too popular, nobody makes money there anymore. Life Phases of a Fast Grower: each may last several years. Keep checking earnings, growth, and stores to check the aura of prosperity. Ask, what will keep earnings going?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Startup phase: companies work out kinks in the basic business. Riskiest phase for the investor because success is not yet established.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Rapid Expansion: the company enters new markets. The safest phase for investors is where the most money is made because growth is merely an act of duplication across markets. The company reinvests all FCF into expansion. No dividends help faster expansion. IPO helps in expanding without bank debt/leverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Maturity / Saturation: company faces the fact that there’s no easy way to continue expansion. Most problematic phase because the company runs into its limitations. Other ways must be found to increase earnings, possibly only via luring customers away from competitors. If M&amp;#x26;A / diworseification follows, then you know management is confused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out growth plans and check if the plan is working?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Cost cuts – the proof is in the decrease in selling and administrative costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Raise prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Entry into new markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iv) Sell more volume in existing markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v) Exit loss-making operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What continues to triumph, vs, flop is:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Capable management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Adequate financing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Methodical approach to expansion – slow but steady wins this kind of race.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a company tries to open &gt;100 stores/year, it’s likely to run into problems. In its rush to glory, it can pick the wrong sites or managers, pay too much for real estate, and fail to train employees properly. It is easier to add 35-40 stores/year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-classification away from Fast Grower
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large fast, growth company faces devaluation risk since growth may slow down as it runs out of space for further expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inability to maintain double-digit growth may be re-classified into a Slow Grower, Cyclical or Stalwart. High fliers of one decade are groundhogs of the next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Growers like hotels/retail having prime real estate turn into Asset Plays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a high risk, especially in younger companies that are overzealous and underfunded. The headache of underfinancing may lead to bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Grower that can’t stand prosperity, diworseify, fall out of favour, and turn into Turnaround candidates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every Fast Grower turns into a Slow Grower, fooling many people. People tend to think that things won’t change, but eventually, they do,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very few companies switch from being a Slow Grower to a Fast Grower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies may fall into two categories simultaneously or pass through all categories over time (Disney).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During 1949-1995, an investment in the 50 growth stocks on Safian’s Growth Index returned 230x, while the Safian Cyclical Index only returned 19x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth companies were the star performers during and after two corrections (1981-82 and 1987), and they held their own in the 1990 Saddam selloff. The only time you wished you didn’t own them was 1973­74 when growth stocks were grossly overpriced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying and Holding Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Grower =&gt; 2x GNP growth rate. Sustaining a 30% growth rate is very difficult, even for three years. 20-25% growth rate is more sustainable (investing sweet spot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best place to find a 10x stock is close to home – if not the backyard, then in the kitchen, mall, workplace etc. You’ll find a likely prospect ~2/3 times a year. The person with the edge can always outguess the person without an edge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long shots rarely pay off. Better to miss the 1st stock move (during phase I), or even the late stage of phase I, when the companies only reached 5-10% of market saturation, and wait to see if it’s plans are working. If you wait, you may never need to buy since failure would’ve become visible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the idea work elsewhere? Must prove that cloning works in other markets and show its ability to survive early mistakes, limited capital, and find required skilled labour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fascinating part of long-term, Fast Growers is how much time you have to catch them. Even a decade later and with stock already up 20x, it’s not too late to capitalize on an idea that has still not run its course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emerging growth stocks are much more volatile than larger companies, dropping and soaring like sparrow hawks around the stable flight of buzzards. After small caps have taken one of these extended dives, they eventually catch up to the buzzards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small Company Index PE / S&amp;#x26;P 500 PE: Since small companies are expected to grow faster than larger ones, they’re expected to sell at higher PEs, theoretically. In practice, this isn’t always the case. When Emerging Growth is unpopular with investors, these small caps get so cheap that their PE = S&amp;#x26;P 500 PE. When wildly popular and bid up to unreasonably high levels, it is = 2x S&amp;#x26;P 500 PE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In such cases, small caps may get clobbered for several years afterward. The best time to buy is when Small PE / Large PE &amp;#x3C; 1.2x. To reap the reward from this strategy, you’ve to be patient. The rallies in small-cap stocks can take a couple of years to gather storm and then several more years to develop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A similar pattern applies to the Growth vs Value pots. Be patient. The watched stock never boils. When in doubt, tune in later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for a good balance sheet and large profits. The trick is figuring out when the growth stops and how much to pay. Recent price run-ups shouldn’t matter as long as PEG makes it attractive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If PEG =1x, then 20% growth @ 20x PE is &gt; 10% growth @ 10x PE. Higher compounded earnings will compensate even for PE multiple shrinkages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High PE leaves little room for error. The best way to handle a situation where you love the company but not the price (great company, high growth, but high PE), is to make a small commitment and then increase it in the next selloff. One can never predict how far the price may fall. Even if you buy after a setback, be prepared for further declines when you might consider buying even more shares. If the story is still good after review, you’re happy that the price fell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The important issue is why the stock has fallen so much. If the long-term story is still intact and the growth will continue for a long time, buy more. If you can place the company in its attractive, mid-life phase, ex. 2nd a decade of 30 years of growth, you shouldn’t mind paying 20x PE for a 20-25% growth rate, especially if market PE = 18-20x with an 8-10% growth rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you sell at 2x, you won’t get 10x. As long as same-store sales are rising, the company isn’t crippled with excess debt and is following its stated expansion plans. Stick around. If the original story stays intact, you’ll be amazed at the results in several years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trick is not to lose a potential 10x, but know that if earnings shrink, so will the PE that’s been bid up high – double whammy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s harder to stick with a winning stock after price increases, vs, continuing to believe in a company after price falls. If you’re in danger of being faked out into selling, revisit the reasons/story as to why you bought it in the first place. There are two ways investors can fake themselves out of the big returns from great growth companies.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Waiting to buy the stock when it looks cheap: Throughout its 27-year rise from a split-adjusted 1.6 cents to $23, Walmart never looked cheap compared to the market. Its PE rarely dropped &amp;#x3C;20x, but earnings grew at 25-30%. Any business that keeps up a 20-25% growth rate for 20 years rewards its owners with a massive return even if the overall market is lower after 20 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Underestimating how long a great growth company can keep up the pace. These “nowhere to grow” theories come up often &amp;#x26; should be viewed skeptically.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t believe them until you check for yourself. Look carefully at where the company does business and at how much growing room is left. Whether or not it has growing room may have nothing to do with its age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wal-Mart IPO’d in 1970. By 1980 = stock 20x, with 7x number of stores. Was it time to sell, not be greedy, &amp;#x26; put the money elsewhere? Stocks don’t care who owns them, and questions of greed are best resolved in church, not in brokerage accounts. The important issue to analyze was not whether the Wal-Mart stock would punish its holders but whether the company had saturated the market. The answer was No. Wal-Mart’s reach was only 15% of the USA. Over the next 11 years, the stock went up another 50x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell When&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold as long as earnings are growing, expansion continues, and no impediments arise. Check the story every few months as if you’re hearing it for the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a Fast Grower rises 50% and the story starts sounding dubious, sell and rotate into another, where the current price is &amp;#x3C;= your purchase price, but the story sounds better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main thing to watch is the end of phase II of rapid expansion. The company has no new stores, old stores are shabby, and the stock is out of fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wall Street covers the stock widely, institutions hold 60%, and three national magazines fawn over the CEO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large companies with 50x PE!? Even at 40x, and with a wide, saturated presence, where will the large company grow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last quarter, same-store sales were down 3%, new store sales were disappointing, and the company is telling positive stories, vs, showing positive results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top executives/employees leave to join a rival.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PE = 30x, but next 2 years’ growth rate = 15%. Therefore, PEG = 2x (very negative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch for the end of the second phase of rapid growth and/or when the company is entering into a mature phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annheuser Busch, Marriott, Taco Bell, Walmart, Gap, AMD, Texas Instruments, Holiday Inn, carpets, plastics, retail, calculators, disk drives, health maintenance, computers, restaurants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it’s possible to make 2-5x in Cyclicals and Undervalued situations (if all goes well), payoffs in Fast Growers like restaurants and retailers are bigger. Restaurants/retailers can expand across the country and keep up the growth rate at 20% for 10-15 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only do they grow as fast as high-tech companies but unlike an electronics or shoe company, restaurants are protected from competition. Competition is slower to arrive, and you can see it coming. A restaurant chain takes a long time to work across the country, and no foreign company can service local customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taste homogeneity helps scale in food, drinks, entertainment, makeup, fashion etc. Popularity in 1 mall = popularity in another. Certain brands prosper at else’s expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ways to increase earnings (restaurants):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Add more locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Improve existing operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) High turnover with low-priced meals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iv) High-priced meals with lower turnover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v) High OPM because of food made with cheaper ingredients or low operating costs. To break even, a restaurant’s sales must = Capital Employed. The restaurant group may only grow slowly at 4%, but if Americans eat &gt;50% of their meals out of home, there’ll be new 20x stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher failure rate than Stalwarts, but if and when one succeeds, it may boost income 10- 20-100x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actors, real estate developers, musicians, small businessmen, athletes, criminals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PE Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highest for Fast Growers at 14-20x. A company with a High PE must have incredible growth (for the next two years) to justify its price. It’s a miracle for even a small company to justify a 50x PE, as may happen during a bull market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 year forward PE of 40x = dangerously high and, in most cases, extravagant. Even the fastest growing companies can rarely achieve 25% growth, and 40% is a rarity. Such frenetic growth isn’t sustainable for long &amp;#x26; growing too fast leads to self-destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40x PE @ 30% growth isn’t attractive, but not bad if S&amp;#x26;P 500 = 23x PE &amp;#x26; Coke PEG = 2x (PE = 30x @ 15% growth).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike Cyclical, where the PE contracts near the end of the cycle, Fast grower’s PE gets bigger and may reach absurd illogical levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings are not constant, and PE of 40x vs 3x shows investor willingness to gamble on higher earnings, vs, skepticism about the cheaply priced company’s future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PEG:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#x3C; 0.5x: very positive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x: fair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2x very negative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Growth + Dividend Yield) / PE
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#x3C; 1x: poor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5x: fair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2x: want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3x: fabulous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Minute Drill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where and how can the company continue to grow fast?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;La Quinta Motels started in Texas. The company successfully duplicated its formula in Arkansas &amp;#x26; Louisiana. Last year it added 28% more units. Earnings have increased every quarter. Plans rapid future expansion &amp;#x26; debt isn’t excessive. Motels are a low-growth and competitive industry, but La Quinta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has found a niche. Long way to go before it saturates the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentage of sales – is a new fast-growing product a large % of sales?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent growth rate – favour 20-25% growth rates. Be wary if growth is &gt; 25%. Hot industries show growth &gt;50%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proof – has the company duplicated its success in &gt;1 city for planned expansion to work? Runway – does it still have room to grow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PE – is it high or low vs growth rate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Δ Growth rate – is expansion speeding up or slowing down? For companies making sales via large, single deals, vs, selling high volume &amp;#x26; low ticket items, growth slowdown can be devastating because doing more volume at bigger ticket sizes is difficult. When growth slows, stock drops dramatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutional ownership / Analyst coverage – no presence is positive, as growth expectations are still not captured in the Price or PE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio Allocation %&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30-40% Allocation in Magellan. Magellan’s allocation to Fast Growers was never &gt;50%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40% in Personal investor’s ten stock portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If looking for 10x stocks, the likelihood increases as you hold more stocks. Among several, the one that goes the farthest may be a&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;surprise. The story may start at a certain point with specific expectations and get progressively better. There’s no way to anticipate pleasant surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More stocks provide greater flexibility for fund rotation. If something happens to a secondary company, it may get promoted to being a primary selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk/Reward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Risk – High Gain. Higher potential upside = Greater potential downside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+10x / (-100%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major bankruptcy risk for small, fast grower’s via underfinanced, overzealous expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major rapid devaluation risk for large fast growers once growth falters because there’s no room left for future expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frankly, there’s no way to separate investing from gambling. Historically, stocks are regarded as investments or dismissed as gambling in a routine and circular fashion, usually at the wrong time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As long as people are willing to pay foolish prices for things, no plan is foolproof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the unsettling fact of risk is accepted, we can separate gambling from investing not by the type of activity but by the participant’s skill, dedication, and enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To a veteran handicapper with the skill to stick to a system, betting on horses offers a relatively secure long-term return. Meanwhile, to the rash and impetuous stock picker, an ‘investment” in stocks is no more reliable than throwing darts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An investment is simply a gamble in which you’ve managed to tilt the odds in your favour. The stock market = is a 7-card stud poker game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can never be certain what will happen, but each new corporate event is like turning up another card. You stay in the game if the cards suggest favourable odds of success. Some “lucky stiffs” come out ahead regularly. They undertake to maximize their ROI by carefully calculating and recalculating their chances as the hand unfolds. Consistent winners raise their bets as their position strengthens, and they exit the game when the odds are against them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, consistent losers hang onto the bitter end of every pot, hoping for miracles and enjoying the thrill of defeat. In stud poker, as on Wall Street, miracles happen often enough to keep the losers losing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent winners also resign themselves to the fact that they’ll occasionally lose to miracles, even when they have a very strong hand. They accept their fate and go on the next hand, confident that their basic method will reward them over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful investors also accept periodic losses, setbacks &amp;#x26; unexpected occurrences. Calamitous drops don’t scare them out of the game. They realize the stock market isn’t like chess, where the better position always wins. You’re never going to be right 9/10. This isn’t like pure science, where you go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aha” and you’ve got the answer. By the time you’ve got “Aha,” the stock quadruples. You’ve to take a little bit of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to make money on every stock pick. A 60% win rate can produce an enviable record. You only need a few big winners for a lifetime of successful investing. Their pluses will overwhelm minuses from stocks that don’t work out. If 7/10 stocks perform as expected, be delighted. 6/10 = Be Thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management ability might be important, but it’s quite difficult to assess. Instead, buy on a company’s prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Minute Drill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After company classification and determining whether the PE is high/low vs immediate prospects, figure out the company’s “story.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Except for possibly Asset Plays, something dynamic has to happen to keep earnings moving. The more certain you are about what that something is, the easier it gets to follow the script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be able to give a 2-minute monologue that covers the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasons you’re interested in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What has to happen for the company to succeed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pitfalls that stand in its path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you can tell the story so that even a child can understand it, you have a proper grasp of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 6-Month Checkup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A healthy portfolio requires a regular checkup – every six months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merchandise is still attractive (it may involve checking the stores)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With fast growers, ask yourself what will keep them growing,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What phase of growth is the company in Start-up, expansion, maturity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even with blue chips, buy and forget can result in wasted opportunities and huge losses. It happens to people who imagine that betting with blue chips relieves them of the need to pay attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s not simply a matter of checking prices – you can’t assume anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve got to follow the stories and get the answer to 2 basic questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Is the stock still attractively Priced vs Earnings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) What’s happening to the company to increase earnings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer – 3 possible conclusions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i) Story has improved = you might want to increase your investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ii) Story has gotten worse = you can decrease your investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iii) Story unchanged = you can either stick with your investment or put the money into another company with more exciting prospects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s silly to get bogged down in PEs, but you don’t want to ignore them. Are PEs of your stocks High/Low/ Fair, vs, industry norms? Is the company selling at a premium or discount vs peers? Track a company’s historical PE track record through several years to get a sense of its normal levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick way to tell if a stock is overpriced is to compare the Price line vs the Earnings line. Buy when Price &amp;#x3C; Earnings. Sell when Price &gt;&gt;&gt; Earnings (dramatically higher).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity: Avoid wonderful small companies because the stocks are thinly traded. In stocks, as in romance, ease of divorce isn’t a sound basis for commitment. If you’ve chosen wisely, you won’t want a divorce. And if you haven’t, you’re in a mess. If a company is a loser, you’ll lose money no matter how many shares it trades, and if it’s a winner, you can unwind profits leisurely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who want to know how stocks fared ask - where did the Dow close? Lynch was interested in the Advance/Decline ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the stock’s current price is &amp;#x3C; IPO price, the stock ‘may be undervalued&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT ADVICE WOULD I GIVE TO SOMEONE WITH $1MM TO INVEST? THE SAME I’D GIVE TO ANY INVESTOR: FIND YOUR EDGE AND PUT IT TO WORK BY ADHERING TO THE FOLLOWING RULES:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Operas: Football Games: 3:1, There’s Something Wrong With Your Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody on his deathbed said I wish I’d spent more time at the office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lynch left home at 6 am, reaching the office at 6:45. Working hours were 0930-2130. Work days were 16 hours long. The secret to success = visiting 400+ companies and reading 700+ annual reports per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fidelity made all managers responsible for their research. They couldn’t blame analysts anymore. Analysts, doing parallel independent research, couldn’t protect themselves by simply touting acceptable, worn-out companies for which they couldn’t get criticized. Thus, there was 2x investigation vs a customary division of labour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formalized information swap sessions, where everyone presented their week’s picks in 1.5-3 minutes. Ninety seconds is enough to tell a stock’s story. If you’ve to invest in a company, then you ought to be able to explain why, in language that a 5th grader could understand, &amp;#x26; quickly enough so the 5th grader won’t get bored. To avoid undermining one another’s confidence, no feedback was allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gentlemen Who Prefer Bonds, Don’t Know What They’re Missing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest income may or may not beat inflation, but stocks will provide 5-6% real return. In the long run, a portfolio of well-chosen stocks/mutual funds will always outperform a bond portfolio or a money-market account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the long run, a portfolio of poorly chosen stocks won’t beat the money left under the mattress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Invest In Any Idea That You Can’t Illustrate With A Crayon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;St. Agnes Portfolio (class 7 students)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple stock-picking methods are more rewarding than boutique techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teacher asks students to put &gt;10 stocks in the portfolio. Kids aren’t allowed to buy any company unless they can explain what it does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50% of stocks must provide a fairly good dividend. Good companies usually increase dividends each year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes a long time to make money, but you can lose it in a short time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t buy a stock because it’s cheap but because you know a lot about it. A cheap stock can always get cheaper. Someday it may rise again, but assuming that will happen = wishing ≠ investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never fall in love with a stock; always have an open mind. Rule of 5 stocks, 1 = Great, 3 = OK, 1 = Really Bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better Investing (NAIC – National Association of Investors Corporation)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Represents &gt;10,000 stock-picking clubs that invest on a regular timetable. This takes the guesswork out of where the market is headed, and doesn’t allow for the impulse decisions that spoil many nest eggs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An individual might be scared out of stocks and later regret it, but in the clubs, nothing can happen without a majority vote. Rule by committee isn’t a good thing, but in this case, it helps ensure that no foolish proposal to sell everything will be carried out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maxims, per NAIC Manual:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold no more stocks than you can remain informed on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to see a) Sales &amp;#x26; EPS growing at an acceptable rate and b) a reasonable stock price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the reasons for past sales growth to form a good judgment on the likelihood of past growth rates continuing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider financial strength &amp;#x26; debt structure to see if a few bad years can hinder the long-term progress. Clubs meet monthly to discuss ideas and decide what to buy next. Each person is responsible for researching 1-2 companies and keeping tabs on the latest developments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mostly buy stocks in well-managed growth companies with a history of prosperity and rising earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rule of Five: NAIC advises a portfolio with &gt;5 stocks. 1 = will do better than you could’ve possibly imagined and will surprise you with phenomenal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;return, 3 = will perform as expected, 1 = will run into unforeseen trouble and disappoint.
- $1,000 invested each year on Jan 31, 1940, grew 334x over 52 years.
- Adding $1,00 annually on Jan 31, improved corpus to 3,554x, from a further $52,000 investments.
- Adding another $1,000 every time market fell 10% (31 times), improved corpus further to 6,295x ($83,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Can’t See The Future Through A Rear View Mirror&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pessimism in 1990 reached a peak during the Iraq War. 1991 was the best year in 2 decades, with S&amp;#x26;P up 30%, Dow up 25%, and small stocks up 60%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful investors develop a disciplined approach that enables them to block out their distress signals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid weekend worrying &amp;#x26; ignore the latest dire predictions because nobody can predict interest rates and the direction of the economy/market. Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what’s happening to the company. Sell a stock if fundamentals deteriorate, not because the sky is falling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s No Point Yo-Yo Ma To Play The Radio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t invest in treasuries via bond funds and pay extra fees &amp;#x26; expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffett’s admonition that people who can’t tolerate seeing their stocks lose 50 percent of their value shouldn’t own stocks also applies to stock funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Long As You’re Picking A Fund, You Might As Well Pick A Good One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easier said than done. 75% of funds perform &amp;#x3C; market average. If a fund equals market returns, it’s in the top 25% of all funds. Why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lousy stock pickers – throw darts instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Herd instinct produces camp followers. They pretend to pursue excellence when actually, they’re closet indexers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indexing popularity has created a self-fulfilling prophecy. S&amp;#x26;P stocks tend to represent large companies that did well recently, enjoying undue momentum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Extravagance Of Any Corporate Office Is Directly Proportional To Management’s Reluctance To Reward The Shareholders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great companies are thrifty, &amp;#x26; maximize returns by running efficient operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Long Term Bond Yields &gt; Dividend Yield Of S&amp;#x26;P500 By =&gt; 6%, Sell Your Stocks And Buy Bonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should you exit the market to avoid the correction? A confirmed stock picker sticks with stocks until he can’t find a single issue worth buying. The only time Lynch took a big position in bonds was in 1982, when inflation was running at double digits and long-term U.S. Treasuries were yielding 13-14%. He didn’t buy bonds for defensive purposes. He bought them since 13-14% &gt; 10-11% historical stock returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can’t find any companies that you think are attractive, put your money into the bank until you discover some.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not All Common Stocks Are Equally Common&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theory that a large fund can’t beat the market is misguided. An imaginative fund manager can pick 1-2000 stocks, in unusual companies, most of which never appear in the typical Wall Street portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market is dominated by a herd of professional investors. Contrary to popular belief, this makes it easier for the amateur investor. You can beat the market by ignoring the herd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Stock To Buy May Be The One You Already Own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of really brilliant companies is finite, so when you do have one it’s better to buy more of it, than to go out to find something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Sure Cure For Taking A Stock For Granted, Is A Big Drop In Price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes good luck can mask bad skills. Like many people who invest with great initial success, Lynch had attained something of a God complex, thinking he was immune to the lumps and bumps of the market. The shocks of 1978 &amp;#x26; 1987 provided the necessary kick in the pants to remind him of who the real boss is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Bet On A Comeback When They’re Playing “Taps”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taps is the name of a bugle tune played at military funerals. Don’t buy just because the price has fallen. There’s no shame in losing money on a stock. Everybody does it. What is shameful is to hold onto a stock, or worse, to buy more when the fundamentals are deteriorating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Like the Store, Chances Are You’ll Like the Stock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The homogeneity of taste in food and fashion that makes for a dull culture also makes fortunes for owners of retail and restaurant companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your edge is not something you get from Wall Street experts. It’s what you already have. You can outperform experts if you use your edge by investing in companies or industries you already understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In every industry and every region of the country, the observant amateur can find great growth companies long before the professionals have discovered them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Insiders Are Buying, It’s A Good Sign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When several insiders buy the stock simultaneously, it’s a positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Business, Competition Is Never As Healthy As Total Domination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a place to invest, lousy industries are better than great industries anytime. In a lousy industry that’s growing slowly, if at all, the weak drop out, and the survivors get a bigger market share. A company that can capture an ever-increasing share of a stagnant market is better than one that has to protect a dwindling share of an exciting market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid hot stocks in hot industries. Great companies in the cold, no-growth industries are consistently big winners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Else Being Equal, Invest In The Company With The Fewest Colour Photos In The Annual Report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a thrifty company that strives for efficiency in all areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you want to see on the balance sheet is at least twice as much equity as debt, and the more equity and the less debt, the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Even The Analysts Are Bored, It’s Time To Start Buying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real bargains are in industries Wall Street ignores. Giant conglomerates have 50 analysts watching their every move. Being popular, they’re often bought up to silly PEs. It is the whole phenomenon of the market buying what they are familiar with rather than what is good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When investing in a troubled industry, buy companies with staying power. Also, wait to see signs of revival. Buggy whips &amp;#x26; radio tubes were troubled industries that never came back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to facts, not forecasts. Ask yourself: What do I make if I’m right, and what could I lose if I’m wrong? Look for a risk-reward ratio of 3:1 or better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A stock-market decline is as routine as a winter Colorado blizzard. If prepared, it can’t hurt you. A decline is a great chance to pick up bargains left behind by those fleeing the storm in panic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long shots usually backfire or become “no shots.” Don’t buy “cheap” stocks just because they’re cheap. Buy them because the fundamentals are improving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unless You’re A Short Seller Or A Poet Looking For A Wealthy Wife, It Never Pays To Be Pessimistic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since Lynch always thought positively and assumed that the economy would improve, he was always willing to invest in Cyclicals at their nadir. Things begin to get better when things can’t get any worse with Cyclicals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important question about a cyclical is whether the company’s balance sheet is strong enough to survive the next downturn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before I invest in any S&amp;#x26;L, I like to see that its equity assets ratio is at least 7.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies, Like People, Change Their Names Either Because They’ve Gotten Married, Or They’ve Been Involved In Some Fiasco That They Hope The Public Will Forget.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whenever The Queen Is Selling, Buy It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a democracy, investors vote &amp;#x26; governments don’t want disgruntled investors who’ve lost money. The British learnt this in 1983 after two privatizations came out overpriced &amp;#x26; prices dropped. Since then, the British have structured deals, so investors don’t lose money, at least in the short term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing is fun, exciting and dangerous if you don’t do any work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep track of every stock’s story in a logbook. Note any new events &amp;#x26; pay close attention to earnings. Is it growth, value or cyclical play?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behind every stock is a company. Find out what it’s doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks do well for a reason and do poorly for a reason. Make sure you know the reasons. You have to know what you own and why you own it. “This baby is a cinch to go up!” doesn’t count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Often, there is no correlation between the success of a company’s operations and the success of its stock over a few months or even a few years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the long term, there is a 100% correlation between the success of the company and its stock – This disparity is the key to making money; it pays to be patient and to own successful companies. The stocks that rewarded Lynch the most made their greatest gains in the 3rd or 4th year of ownership. A few took ten years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owning stocks is like having children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t get involved with more than you can handle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The part-time stock picker probably has time to follow 5-12 companies, &amp;#x26; to buy and sell shares as conditions warrant. There don’t have to be &gt;5 companies in the portfolio at any time. Nobody forces you to own any of them. If you like 7, buy 7. If you like 3, buy 3. If you like 0, buy 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest losses come from companies with poor balance sheets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before risking money, check the balance sheet to see if the company is financially sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With small companies, you’re better off waiting until they turn a profit before investing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter early — but not too early. Think of investing in growth companies in terms of baseball. Try to join the game in the 3rd inning because a company has proved itself by then. You’re taking unnecessary risks if you buy before the line-up is announced. There’s plenty of time (10-15 years, at times) between the 3rd and the 7th innings, which is where the 10-50 baggers are made. If you buy in the late innings, you may be too late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you invest $1,000, all you can lose is $1,000, but you stand to gain $10,000 or even $50,000 if you’re patient&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average person can concentrate on a few good companies, while the fund manager is forced to diversify. By owning too many stocks, you lose this advantage of concentration. It only takes a handful of big winners to make a lifetime of investing worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone has the brainpower to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic, you should avoid stocks and stock mutual funds altogether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have the stomach for stocks, but neither the time nor the inclination to do the homework, invest in equity mutual funds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, it’s a good idea to diversify. You should own a few different kinds of funds, with managers pursuing different investing styles: growth, value, small companies, large companies, etc. Investing in six of the same kind of fund is not diversification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don’t study companies, you’ll have the same success buying stocks as you do in poker when betting without looking at cards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you study 10 companies, you’ll find 1 with bright prospects that aren’t reflected in the price - pleasant surprises are always to be found in the market - companies whose achievements are overlooked on Wall Street.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can afford to be patient, even if you missed Walmart in the first five years. It was a great stock to own in the next five years. Time is against you when you own options. Don’t invest in the margin because a market drop can wipe you out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The capital gains tax penalizes investors who switch too much&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’ve invested in funds that have done well, don’t abandon them capriciously. Stick with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Among the major world markets, the US ranks 8th in total return over the past decade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can take advantage of faster-growing economies by investing some assets in an overseas fund with a good record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what’s the bottom line?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you think a company’s product is going to grow significantly, then the question is: what percentage of revenue or net income does that product accounts for? For companies like Procter and Gamble, Pampers may be a fast-growing product, but its impact on the company’s bottom may be too small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Companies, Small Moves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bigger the company, the harder it is to keep the growth percentage constant or increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t study any companies you have the same chance of success buying stocks as you do in a poker game if you bet without looking at your cards.
Time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies. You can afford to be patient—even if you missed Wal-Mart in the first five years, it was a great stock to own in the next five years. Time is against you when you own options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you study 10 companies, you’ll find 1 for which the story is better than expected. If you study 50, you’ll find 5. There are always pleasant surprises to be found in the stock market—companies whose achievements are being overlooked on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody can predict interest rates, the future direction of the economy, or the stock market. Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what’s actually happening to the companies in which you’ve invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always something to worry about. Avoid weekend thinking and ignore the latest dire predictions of newscasters. Sell a stock because the company’s fundamentals deteriorate, not because the sky is falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every industry and every region of the country, the observant amateur can find great growth companies long before the professionals have discovered them.ssss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All you have to do is put as much effort into picking your stocks as you do in buying your groceries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I look back on it now, it’s obvious that studying history and philosophy was much better preparation for the stock market than, say, studying statistics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the math you need in the stock market you get in the fourth grade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stocks I try to buy are the very stocks that traditional fund managers try to overlook. In other words, I continue to think like an amateur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Between the chance of making an unusually large profit on an unknown company and the assurance of losing only a small amount on an established company, the normal mutual-fund manager, pension-fund manager, or corporate-portfolio manager would jump at the latter. Success is one thing, but it’s more important not to look bad if you fail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To me, an investment is simply a gamble in which you’ve managed to tilt the odds in your favor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No wonder people make money in the real estate market and lose money in the stock market. They spend months choosing their houses, and minutes choosing their stocks. In fact, they spend more time shopping for a good microwave oven than shopping for a good investment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Only invest what you could afford to lose without that loss having any effect on your daily life in the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The good news I can tell you is that to be a great investor you don’t have to have a terrific IQ. If you’ve got 160 IQ, sell 30 points to somebody else because you won’t need it in investing. What you do need is the right temperament. You need to be able to detach yourself from the views of others or the opinions of others.”  —Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to be able to make decisions without complete or perfect information. Things are almost never clear on Wall Street, or when they are, then it’s too late to profit from them. The scientific mind that needs to know all the data will be thwarted here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some have fancied themselves ‘long-term investors,’ but only until the next big drop (or tiny gain), at which point they quickly become short-term investors and sell out for huge losses or the occasional minuscule profit. It’s easy to panic in this volatile business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously you don’t have to be able to predict the stock market to make money in stocks, or else I wouldn’t have made any money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market ought to be irrelevant. If I could convince you of this one thing, I’d feel this book had done its job. And if you don’t believe me, believe Warren Buffett. “As far as I’m concerned,” Buffet has written, “the stock market doesn’t exist. It is there only as a reference to see if anybody is offering to do anything foolish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s not to say that there isn’t such a thing as an overvalued market, but there’s no point worrying about it. The way you’ll know when the market is overvalued is when you can’t find a single company that’s reasonably priced or that meets your other criteria for investment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe in predicting markets. I believe in buying great companies—especially companies that are undervalued and/or underappreciated… Pick the right stocks and the market will take care of itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ll get your biggest moves in smaller companies. You don’t buy stock in a giant such as Coca-Cola expecting to quadruple your money in two years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sure sign of slow grower is that it pays a generous and regular dividend. Companies pay generous dividends when they can’t dream up new ways to use the money to expand the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If companies aren’t going anywhere fast, neither will the price of their stocks. If growth in earnings is what enriches a company, then what’s the sense of wasting time on sluggards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The perfect stock would be attached to the perfect company, and the perfect company has to be engaged in a perfectly simple business, and the perfectly simple business ought to have a perfectly boring name. The more boring it is, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I get even more excited when a company with a boring name also does something boring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A company that does boring things is almost as good as a company that has a boring name, and both together is terrific. Both together is guaranteed to keep the oxymorons away until finally good news compels them to buy in, thus sending the stock price even higher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Better than boring alone is a stock that’s boring and disgusting at the same time. Something that makes people shrug, retch, or turn away in disgust is ideal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…spinoffs normally have strong balance sheets and are well-prepared to succeed as independent entities. And once these companies are granted their independence, the new management, free to run its own show, can cut costs and take creative measures that improve the near-term and longer term companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you find a stock with little or no institutional ownership, you’ve found a potential winner. Find a company that no analyst has even visited, or that no analyst would admit to know about, and you have got a double winner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s where the biggest winners are developed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a no-growth industry especially one that’s boring and upsets people, there’s no problem with competition. You don’t have to protect your flanks from potential rivals because nobody else is going to be interested. That gives you the leeway to continue to grow, to gain market share…“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing thrilling about the thrilling high-growth industry, except watching the stocks go down. Carpets in the 1950s, electronics in the 1960s, computers in the 1980s, were all exciting high-growth industries, in which numerous major and minor companies unerringly failed to prosper for long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always look for niches. The perfect company would have to have one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drug companies and chemical companies have niches—products that no one else is allowed to make.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chemical companies have niches in pesticides and herbicides. It’s not any easier to get a poison approved than it is to get a cure approved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brand names such as Robitussin or Tylenol, Coca-Cola or Marlboro, are almost as good as niches. It costs a fortune to develop public confidence in a soft drink or a cough medicine. The whole process takes years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d rather invest in a company that makes drugs, soft drinks, razor blades, or cigarettes than in a company that makes toys. In the toy industry, somebody can make a wonderful doll that every child has to have, but every child gets only one each.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why take chances on fickle purchases when there’s so much steady business round?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of investing in computer companies that struggle to survive in an endless price war, why not invest in a company that benefits from the price war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of investing in a company that makes automatic scanners, why not invest in the supermarkets that install the scanners? If a scanner helps a supermarket company cut costs just three percent, that alone might double the company’s earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no better tip-off to the probable success of a stock than that people in the company are putting their own money into it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When management owns stock, then rewarding the shareholders becomes a first priority, whereas when management simply collects a paycheck, then increasing salaries become a first priority”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s only one reason that insiders buy: They think the stock price is undervalued and will eventually go up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the multibillion-dollar futures and options market, not a bit of money is put into constructive use. It doesn’t finance anything, except the cars, planes and houses purchased by the brokers and the handful of winners. What we are witnessing here is a giant transfer payment from the unwary to the wary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market, like individual stocks, can move in the opposite direction of the fundamentals over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market is the one place where the high achiever is routinely show up. It’s easy to get an F here. If you buy futures and options and attempt to time the market, it’s easy to get all F’s…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll never lose your job losing your client’s money in an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Another key element in portfolio management is curtailing the duration (the weighted average life) of one’s portfolio through exposure to investments with catalysts for the realization of underlying value. Catalytic events shift the outcome of investments from a reliance on future market multiples and macroeconomic developments (which are not at all under your control) to a dependence on your assessment of the outcomes, probabilities, and implications of announced or anticipated corporate events, including mergers and acquisitions, bond maturities, debt restructurings, bankruptcies, major corporate asset sales, spinoffs, and tender offers. No strategy can avoid all risk of loss. But we believe our approach should increase the likelihood of achieving sustainable gains with limited downside risk over the long- run. To put it differently, a portfolio of near infinite duration (such as an all equity portfolio without catalysts) can trade just about anywhere. With such exposures, if stock prices plummet, the odds go up that an investor will feel pressure to do the wrong thing and sell into market weakness. A limited duration portfolio, both because of the hopefully truncated downside in a bad market as well as the beneficial cash inflows (buying power) that catalysts usually generate, is hugely advantageous in navigating through turmoil.” Seth Klarman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;circle of competence - “know what you know”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organize valuation components by reliability: most reliable -&gt; least reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organize valuation components by underlying strategic assumption: no competitive advantage -&gt; growing competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The search for undervalued stocks should start with companies that are undesirable, such as those in bankruptcy or suffering from financial distress”. Another way to think about is to focus on great company at fair price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the problem with the present value method is that it is a terminal value calculation as of today, and it does not avoid the problems with terminal calculation (terminal value is the value of a company’s cash flows projected beyond the end of year 10, when the cash flow grows perpetually at a constant proportional rate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discounted cash flows models problems
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies grow at vastly different levels and rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it is a rule for translating between the assumptions that you can make reliably about the future and the present day value of the security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;combining bad information with good information and you are not using assumptions you can make but you are also throwing away information that is on the balance sheet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings power value technique
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the value of assets a competitor will be required to have in order to achieve the same market value of incumbent company in the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings power value calculated based on current financial status where the resulting intrinsic value ignores business cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;growth is usually ignored in this valuation technique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-analysis/earnings-power-value-epv/&quot;&gt;Earnings Power value (EPV) Stock valuation How-to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a note, Enron had great earnings all the way up to its collapse but FCF foretold the troubles long before the scandal surfaced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value investors consider the three sources of intrinsic value to be the reproduction cost of the company’s assets, the current earnings power of any franchise, and the value of its earnings growth within that franchise. The most difficult aspect to value is the worth of future earnings growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In its simples terms, value investing is the process of calculating the fundamental value of a security, comparing this value to the market price and buying if the value is sufficiently higher than the price to provide a cushion against risk. Value investors are not, repeat not:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technicians, who look only at price movement patterns, ignoring fundamental value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macro-fundamental, or top-down investors, who try to read and predict the market’s response to broad economic events but do not usually scrutinize individual stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price and earnings forecasters, who estimate future earnings based on various factors and buy when their estimate beats the market’s estimate, implied in the market price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value investing demands two virtues: humility and patience. Value investors have to know what they know and know what they don’t know. The best tend to specialize in one area and develop a real understanding of its economics, since a big, meaningful gap exists between “undervalued” and “cheap.” Value investors have to wait until a real bargain comes along. When they find and buy it, they have to wait until the market recognizes the fundamental value and the market price adjusts. Both waits may be long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;search-strategy&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#search-strategy&quot; aria-label=&quot;search strategy permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;search strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“every time you sell stock, someone else is buying that security. &lt;strong&gt;One person on one side of the trade is always wrong&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have to know what you know and what you don’t know&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not all value is measurable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not all value is measure by you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where do I have the advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;great investors focus on specific opportunities in concentrated ways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value investing rests on 3 key characteristics of financial markets
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotionalism and short-term thinking rule market prices in the short-run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;financial assets do have underlying or fundamental economic values that are relatively stable and can be measured by diligent and disciplined investor. Price and value often diverge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a strategy of buying when prices are 33% to 50% below the calculated intrinsic value will produce superior returns in the long-run. The size of the gap between price and value is the “margin of safety”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you identify a statistical irregularity, you want to be able to explain it with an enduring rational to individual and institutional behavior.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutional bias
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;herding: money managers do not want to stray too far from the performance of indexes or “me-too” manager will jump on bandwagon as other people buy and drive stocks up to high P/Es&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;window-dressing: buy the best acting stocks near or before the end of quarter so you have more positive stocks to show investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;block-busters: people will be overly focused on looking for next blockbuster stock like microsoft. You want to be on the other side of their trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;individual bias
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loss aversion: People will gamble to avoid a sure loss. People will take on more loss to avoid sure loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lotteries: people like to buy lottery tickets and get rich quick, that is why people love buying glamour stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hindsight bias: people think they know what is going on. They don’t remember what they really did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set up a data collection and search strategy to find disappointing cheap stocks or where there is a temporary supply/demand imbalance. You want a less well informed, less rational person than you on the other side of the trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at insiders
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who is buying and selling the stock, insiders, management, and investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;search criteria: where are the unreflective sellers&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obscure: small caps, spin-offs, post bankruptcy, boring with low analyst coverage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since funds can’t own small stocks, analysts don’t cover them and the stocks stay obscure. Spin-offs may be small, unheralded and dumped, despite their merits. And, the market tends to ignore boring firms that chug along in monotonous mediocrity. When they do something new, no one may be looking (except the astute value investor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industry problems are your friend as long as you know the industry is viable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;undesirable:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;financial distress, bankruptcy, low growth, low P/E, low M/B,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boring is your friend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industry problems (bad loans, regulatory threat, overcapacity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company problem (lawsuit, poor subsidiary performance, poor year)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for large cap global stocks, you are in tough competition.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you would like to be the only one seriously studying a particular security or one of a few people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if you do nothing, but eliminate the high glamour growth stocks you get another one or two percent&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inherent institutional and individual biases create ongoing opportunities and glamour stocks (high growth high P/E)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for companies with sustainable competitive advantages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you want a management that understands the source of of the company’s competitive advantage and will protect it and not tie it to competitive disadvantages or negative synergies in other segment the way Apple did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is this industry viable or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;view &lt;strong&gt;tangible assets at liquidation costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s the most reliable information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the industry is not viable and the company going to get liquidated, you would want to see the valuation in liquidation and that is closely tied to assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assets - Look at the balance sheet. Work from the top down. Some values have to be adjusted because accounting numbers are more accurate for some assets and liabilities than for others. What matters is the assets’ value if they were sold today. If an industry is on the path to extinction, its equipment and inventory may not have more than scrap value. If the industry will continue to exist, the proper value is the “reproduction value,” the cost of replacing the asset. In general, items at the top of the balance sheet - cash, receivables, inventory - have values close to the book value. The book value is more questionable farther down the balance sheet. Usually it’s possible to come up with an estimate more reliable than an estimate of future earnings. The assets and liabilities are real, exist now and do have some value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reproduction cost of an asset is the most appropriate measure of its worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the industry to viable, then sooner or later the assets are going to be replaced, so you have to look at the costs of reproducing those assets as efficient as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/how-to-asset-reproduction-value-analysis/&quot;&gt;asset reproduction value analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the second most reliable measure of a firm’s intrinsic value is the value of its current earnings, properly adjusted. This value can be estimated with more certainty than future earnings or cash flows, and it is more relevant to today’s values than are earnings in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings, if they are sustainable, are supported by assets or barriers to entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash flow - Benjamin Graham and David Dodd used the Earnings Power Value (EPV) formula to calculate the level of distributable cash flow that a company could reasonably sustain. The formula is: “EPV = Adjusted Earnings x 1/R, where R is the current cost of capital.” Because companies often artificially inflate earnings by booking some costs as allegedly non-recurring, the savvy value investor researches the history, calculates the usual ratio of such charges to reported earnings and reduces current reported earnings appropriately. The investor may need to make a similar adjustment for depreciation and amortization, which can also misrepresent the real need to reinvest. Finally, the investor considers the business cycle, adjusting earnings based on whether the company is at its top or bottom. The EPV must be sustainable. For assurance that it is, look for sustaining strategic advantages like franchise value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless there is something to interfere with this process of entry, sooner or later the market value of the company will be driven down to the reproduction value of the assets. &lt;em&gt;Reversion to the Mean or the Uniformity of One Price&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have EPV in excess of reproduction value (AV) of the assets, there had better be something to interfere with the process of entry such as competitive advantage such as barriers of entry, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;then and only then you should worry about growth&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the only case where growth has value is where the growth occurs behind the protection of an identifiable competitive advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;growth only has value if it is a strong franchise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to adjust for any accounting shenanigans that are going on, you have to adjust for the cyclical situation, for the tax situation that may be short-lived, for excess depreciation over the cost of maintenance capital expense (MCX). And really for anything else that is going on that is causing current earnings to deviate from long run sustainable earnings. So &lt;strong&gt;valuation is calculated by a company’s long-run sustainable earnings multiplied by 1/cost of capital&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;entry barriers: A franchise only has value when competitors can’t easily enter the market and take chunks of it away. Only a few things create real barriers to entry:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government - Licenses and other legally protected privileges, e.g. cable franchises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs
- Expense creates a barrier if the incumbent has cost advantages no one can duplicate, especially patents or proprietary knowledge a competitor can’t match or buy. Economies of scale matter; if unit costs fall as more units are produced, a new entrant can’t match a high-volume leader (absent new technology or processes).
- Revenues - In rare cases, customers are so attached to a particular brand (think Coca-Cola) that it is very difficult for a new entrant to seduce them. Also, costly switching virtually traps customers, i.e., buyers of corporate software suites must also train staff and debug. Here, the cost of switching helps protect Microsoft’s franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AV &gt; EPV
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the EPV as a guide to intrinsic value. Either management is doing a bad job (and could only be dislodged in a takeover) or the industry suffers from overcapacity (so increased value requires reduced capacity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AV approximately equal to EPV
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It tells a story of an industry that is in balance. It is exactly what you would expect to see if there were no barriers-to- entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management is probably mediocre and the firm lacks a competitive edge. To check, examine management’s returns and judge whether they are about average. Is the industry stable, or do competitors come and go? This kind of firm may be a good value investment if market price falls far enough below fundamental value for a margin of safety, but growth estimates are worthless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accounts receivable can be valued at book value, although in liquidation, you will recover 90% to 95% of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good management always adds value to the assets not already embedded in the earnings. Bad management subtracts value from the assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;growth is valued separately since growth is where all the uncertainty resides and you want to segregate that uncertainty from what you know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth is relatively rarely valuable in the long run. &lt;strong&gt;Growth at a competitive disadvantage has negative value&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only case where growth has value is where the growth occurs behind the protection of an identifiable competitive advantage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is usually &lt;strong&gt;stable market share&lt;/strong&gt; which is symptomatic of that last situation that means in the long run,the company will grow at the industry rate. And in the long run, almost all industries grow at the rate of global GDP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value of growth
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;verify the existence of a franchise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify the cash distributions in terms of dividends and buybacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t overestimate growth once the company is out of its rapid growth phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;competitive analysis&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Porter’s 5 forces that effect the operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dominant force determining whether this is good business or not: entrants and expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the companies who have sustainable competitive advantages are the ones like MSFT and INTI, WMT, CISCO who focus on narrow segments on geographical space or product space and dominate those particular segments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower cost structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customer captivity due to habits, search costs or switching costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;globalization and large, fast growth is the enemy of competitive advantage and profitability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your local infrastructure in relation to the size of the market will determine your regional economies of scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Value investors control risk by specializing in situations that don’t correlate with the market, such as take-overs, spin-offs, arbitrage, bankruptcy and workouts. They double-check their conclusions by watching insiders or knowledgeable investors and by closely scrutinizing their calculations for errors. They use position limits to restrict how much they invest in any one stock or security. Or, like Warren Buffett, they buy whole companies.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;defensive investor’s portfolio should be well balanced, safe and very easy to manage.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at the portfolio of well established investment funds (consider ray dalio’s all weather portfolio, weird portfolio of deep value stock geek, etc…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;majority of portfolio should include index funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it typically consists of high-grade bonds, inflation protected bonds, large cap index fund, gold/silver index fund and common stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minority of portfolio (less than 10%) could be invested in common stocks (at least 10 different companies in different industries)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to employ the services of an expert (once a year) to guide you to make the best investment decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dollar-cost averaging, whereby you invest in a common stock every month or quarter and always with the same amount of money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;readjust your portfolio’s division of common stocks, bonds, index funds, etc… Ask yourself: are my stocks still profitable? is the ratio about the same as when I had initially invested? has the management done anything that lost my trust?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enterprising investor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start similarly to defensive investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invest more in common stocks, as they are more profitable (yet riskier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enterprising investors should limit these stocks to a maximum of 10 percent of her overall portfolio. It is because Mr Market is too wild for any rational person to predict and placing the limits to protect our money in case of economic downturn or poor investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continual research and monitoring of their portfolios is essential to maintain an incoming profit flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice with virtual account for at least 1 year before trading in real accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy in low markets and sell in high markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s extremely difficult to find a good financial professional who can guarantee you large returns on your money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mutual funds, in which investments from many people are pooled, usually come with a high management fee. After subtracting the fee, you’re often left with below-average returns.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;professional money managers can’t afford to perform lower than average for long periods because they keep need to keep their clients satisfied all the time. It’s difficult to hold onto a strategy which might not work for months or years at a time, no matter how effective the strategy is in the long term. You can, though, All it takes is some patience to stock with it during the good and not-so-good times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;index fund such as Standard &amp;#x26; Poor’s 500 Index is a mutual fund which aims to match the market’s best performing companies, as opposed to trying to beat them. Since index fund fees are lower, and because on average the market performs well, index funds often provide you with very healthy profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the stock market values of most companies swing drastically over short time periods for no rational reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider “earnings yield” and the “return on capital” when putting together your investment portfolio
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combine both earnings yield and ROC into one single measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rank the companies based on Earnings Yield and ROC separately and then combine their scores by adding them the scores (ranks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings yield
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tells you what the business earns in relation to its share price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calculated by finding the ratio of earnings before interests expenses and tax (EBIT), to enterprise value (EV). The EV is the market value plus the net interest-bearing debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return on capital
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calculated by dividing the after-tax profit by the book value of invested capital (total amount of money invested by the company’s shareholders, bondholders, and so on)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveals how effective a company is at transforming investment into profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take the following pre-caution with your strategy:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apply the strategy when choosing stocks of large companies, not small ones. Smaller companies don’t have much to offer in terms of shares, so even a slight increase in demand can force their share price up. You may therefore find it challenging to buy their shares at a reasonable price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the strategies should include owning 20-30 large company stocks (in different industries) at a time. (I prefer to narrow the list less than 10, so I can read more about the companies and have a good reason why I want to buy the companies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use tax laws intelligently to maximize your profit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell stocks which lost value before one-year holding period ends, which would decreases your yearly income and thus the taxes you will need to pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell the stocks which increase value after one-year holding period ends, which would reduce your tax on capital gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy stock only when its price is below its intrinsic value, its value as it relates to a company’s propensity for growth. Furthermore, you believe there is a probable margin between what you pay and what you will earn as the company grows (margin of safety)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;principles
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intelligent investors analyze the long-term development and business principles of the companies in which they’re considering investing before buying any stock.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;examining the company’s financial history, structure, quality of its management and whether it pays steady dividends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t fall into the trap of only looking at short-term earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this would give you a better idea of how well a company performs independent of its value on the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protect against serious losses by diversifying the investments. (portfolio of 10-20 stocks in different industries)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand that you don’t pull in extraordinary profits, but safe and steady revenues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the target for intelligent investor is to meet her personal needs, not to outperform the professional stockbrokers on Wall Street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand the importance of stock-market history
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economic crises, the unpredictability of the market means that investors need to be prepared - financially and psychologically to ensure that you can take a big hit and survive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t sell everything at the first sign of danger. Remember instead that, even after the most devastating crashes, the market will always recover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the history of the market will give you a better idea of its stability. Once you’ve determined that the market is stable, focus on the history of the company in which you’d like to invest.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at the correlation between stock price and the company’s earnings and dividends over the past 10 years. Then consider the inflation rate, in order to see how much you’d really earn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focuses on individual companies, rather than macro-economic factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invests in companies with sustainable competitive advantages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prefers becoming an expert on a few companies over major diversification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bases his investment decisions on the operational performance of the underlying businesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;holds on to stocks for an extremely long period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minimizes risks by requiring a significant margin of safety before investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sticks to the companies within the “circle of competence”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contrarian, always going against the crowd and buying at the point of maximum pessimism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global investment approach: looks for interesting stocks in every country, but preferably countries with limited inflation, high economical growth, and a movement toward liberalization and privatization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prefers a concentrated portfolio with around 10-12 stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be patience and keep an open-mind and a skeptical attitude towards conventional wisdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first step is to look for stocks trading below 2/3rd of net current asset value (NCAV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prefers companies which pay dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings should be growing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;price/earnings ratio should be lower than 15 over the past 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid technical analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasizes the importance of honest, able management, and shareholder friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should not follow the masses, but instead have patience and think for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asking questions to customers, employees, competitors, analysts, suppliers and management to find out more about the competitive position of a company and its management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only sells when a company starts experiencing issues with its business model, competitive positioning, or management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looks for low-risk, high-uncertainty opportunities with a significant upside potential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use value line investment survey to find attractive stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is futile to predict interest rates and where the economy is heading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;formulates exactly why the stock should be bought before actually buying it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use several valuation methods simultaneously, since no method is perfect and it is impossible to precisely calculate the intrinsic value of a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you should find out not only if an asset is undervalued, but also why it is undervalued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when it comes to shrewd trading, a knowledge of history is a fine weapon, so be sure to keep it sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t trust the crowd or the market and follow practical investment based on your unique investment style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow the investor that interests you such as Benjamin Graham, Warrent Buffet, Peter Lynch, John Templeton, etc…
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow the corporate insiders who run the companies (president, chairman, CEO, chief legal counsel, directors, board members who meet regularly with the officers, form 4 on details of the insider trades, etc…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s a good sign when insiders buy their own company shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;criterias for growth/risky stock:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the company is a leader in cutting-edge technology that changes how we live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has breakthrough products used by millions of customers around the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those products are protected by trademarks and patents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars in future safes and profits - not just expected but, ideally, contractually guaranteed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s relatively undiscovered and trading for low price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s a good sign when insiders buy their own company shares
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;top level insider buying , directors, officers, chairmen board, c-level executives… Who are intimated acquainted with company financial health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total buys must exceed 100k and it’s clister from mutiple top level insider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 factors that impact the investment portfolio:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of money you save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the length of time you allow that money to compound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your portfolio’s investment returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of expenses your portfolio absorbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of taxes you pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your asset allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People remember the recent past better than the distant past, and they informally generalize from a few cases that are memorable rather than incorporate the full body of data into their analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it tracks value”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best predictor of a mutual fund’s future investment return is not the number of Morningstar stars it receives, but how low its expense ratio is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;price is what you pay, value is what you get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“financial markets, far from accurately reflecting all the available knowledge, always provide a distorted view of reality. This is the principle of fallibility. The degree of distortion may vary from time to time. Sometimes, it’s quite insignificant, at other times, it is quite pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every bubble has 2 components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. When a positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, a boom-bust process is set in motion. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing may not be neurosurgery, but it isn’t child’s play either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To recall a piece of wisdom Warren Buffett frequently cites, if you have been in the poker game for thirty minutes and still don’t know who the patsy is, you can be pretty certain the patsy is you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes are based on the Illuminated edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In investing, no rule works all the time. Markets are fluid systems, influenced by many variables, including the players involved in it. Change is constant. Surprises are inevitable. Unexpected things do happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best investment approach should be built on common sense and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Level Thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To earn above-average returns, you not only must think differently and behave differently than everyone else, but you must be right more often than the consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-level thinkers rely on headlines and consensus opinions to make investment decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second-level thinkers weigh the possible outcomes, compare it against the consensus view, understand the consequences of being wrong, and the probability of being right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-level thinking is simplistic and binary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second-level thinking is complex and probabilistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second-level thinkers often ask: “Who doesn’t know that?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Efficiency: markets are quick to incorporate new information into asset prices. However, it does not mean assets are priced accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More “efficient” assets tend to be: widely known, broadly followed, socially acceptable, and the information on it is widely available and comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More “inefficient” assets tend to be: little known or followed, taboo or controversial, and the information on it is limited and/or difficult to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inefficiency is necessary to outperform the market, but won’t guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assets prices are a product of consensus view. A contrarian view, and being right, is needed to recognize mispricing in markets. That, of course, is not easy given the same information and behavioral hurdles — including straying from the consensus — as everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chance — good or bad luck — plays a bigger role in short term investment outcomes. Skill plays a bigger role in the cumulative outcome over many, many decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent investing is based on estimates of intrinsic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value investing looks for assets that can be valued based on fundamental factors like earnings or cash flows, which can be bought at a considerable discount to that value. Said another way, value investing looks to buy stocks with a current value significantly higher than its current price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger the discount between price and value, the wider the margin of safety. A margin of safety brings added protection from unexpected events, being wrong, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing is a waiting game. In other words, waiting is a big part of any strategy, be it value, growth, etc. Perfectly timed stock purchases don’t happen without a lot of luck. Investors have no control over how quickly the market corrects a misalignment between value and price. Waiting is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting inevitably means investors are bound to look wrong often. But if the judgment of intrinsic value is correct, then it’s only temporary. That means being comfortable with losses. Fear of looking wrong, being uncomfortable with losses, is what gets investors into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proper valuation, made with confidence, is the best defense against emotional decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large margin of safety makes selling at the right price less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market prices are largely affected by psychology and technicals in the short term. Investors’ psychology can produce wild price swings in the short run. Understanding psychology is key to being able to take advantage of it. Controlling your own emotion is also key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great opportunities arise when buying from forced sellers. That means don’t become a forced seller. - Build a strategy that avoids forced selling at any price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “good” stock can produce losses if you overpay. A “bad” stock can produce gains when bought cheap. An “overpriced” stock can go higher. An “underpriced” stock can go lower. But eventually, valuation does matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roads to Investment Profits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase Intrinsic Value: It’s difficult to predict. Often any potential increase is already priced in. To profit, the actual increase in value must exceed the market’s — the consensus — expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply Leverage: A “good” investment doesn’t become a “great” investment with leverage. Leverage only magnifies gains and losses. It increases the risk of ruin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell an Asset for More Than Its Worth: It requires a greater fool to come along and overpay for your asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy an Asset for Less Than Its Worth: One of the most reliable ways to profit…so long as you’re willing to wait. Even so, it’s not always guaranteed to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk results from an unknowable future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding or minimizing risk is a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment decisions should always consider the risk involved and potential return. Then determine if the return justifies the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riskier investments have a wider range of outcomes and more uncertainty around where the outcome falls. In other words, uncertainty means riskier investments can have high returns, low returns, or even a loss. And the probability distribution may be impossible to predict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk = the possibility of permanent loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Types of Risk to Watch for:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falling Short of Your Goals: investing is personal. It’s usually done with specific goals in mind like retirement, college education, etc. Not meeting those goals poses a risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benchmark Risk: is an unwillingness to underperform a popular benchmark index, like the S&amp;#x26;P 500, in the short term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career Risk: when a fund manager’s investment decisions are based more on keeping their job than the outcome of their funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconventionality: the risk of being different. Investing differently than the market often leads to returns that deviate from the market — not always in a good way. Being unconventional can get people fired or lead to market-beating returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illiquidity: liquidity is the ability to turn assets into cash without sacrificing on price. The risk is not being able to do that when cash is needed most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk is a function of price and value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of loss can be caused by strong or weak fundamentals depending on the price paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of loss is possible under a strong or weak economic environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk is often an educated guess. It’s also difficult to measure in hindsight. Every investment has a range of outcomes. It’s impossible to measure risk knowing the outcome that did occur, without also knowing all the alternative outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Randomness and luck play a role in individual investment outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most investors make decisions with the expectation that the future will mirror the past and underestimate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worst-case projections are often based on what we know through history and fail to consider that something worse than what’s already happened, can happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk is uncertainty in the possibility that loss occurs out of all the possible outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High risk and low returns due to high prices are one and the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk tolerance, for the average investor, tends to move opposite of stock prices. As prices rise too high, investors become less risk-averse (more risk-tolerant) when they should be more risk-averse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many market bubbles were blown under the belief that something has no risk. Risk exists in every investment. The belief in no risk stems from widespread investor behavior that’s extremely optimistic and risk-averse. It’s a danger to watch out for. Risk is highest when the belief risk doesn’t exist is widespread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things to watch out for when risk is highest is excessive optimism, nonexistent skepticism, easy credit, strong capital inflows, low returns on “safe” investments,  recent high returns on typically “unsafe” investments, and a belief that those returns will stay high going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In most cases, people are overconfident in their ability to see risk and avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “Perversity of Risk” = “When investors feel risk is high, their actions serve to reduce risk. But when investors believe risk is low, they create dangerous conditions. The market is dynamic rather than static, and it behaves in ways that are counterintuitive.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk is often highest when the consensus believes it is lowest and vice versa. When the consensus believes an investment is risky and refuses to own it, their unwillingness likely reduces its price to a point where risk is lowest. The opposite is also true. When the consensus believes an investment is risk-free and everyone owns it, that enthusiastic demand has driven its price to a point where risk is highest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best investors earn asymmetrical returns to the risk they take. They often have a track record of avoiding disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk management — risk control — is essential even when a potential risk isn’t obvious. It usually means forgoing some return to avoid any potential loss, even if the loss is never realized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s important to remember that history is only a rough guide to what’s possible. Better and worse outcomes can occur. Outliers are possible that break entirely from historical norms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economies, markets, and businesses rise and fall. It’s partially due to the involvement of people. Other factors are involved too but people reacting to those factors play a big role in the swings of cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Cycle: “Prosperity brings expanded lending, which leads to unwise lending, which produces large losses, which makes lenders stop lending, which ends prosperity, and on and on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistake investors often make is believing a trend will continue, that a company will do well forever, and that the cycle is broken. Reversion is far more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets resemble a perpetual pendulum, swinging back and forth between two extremes. At one extreme are euphoria, greed, optimism, risk-tolerance, and overpriced assets. At the other are depression, fear, pessimism, risk-aversion, and underpriced assets. The pendulum never stops at the midpoint of its swing or the “average.” It’s always swinging through it, towards one extreme or the other. It’s the swing of the pendulum that’s dependable. What’s less dependable — that keeps everyone guessing — is the rate, the speed, and power of the swing. We never know how far it swings, what causes it to reverse (or when or how quickly it reverses), and how far it swings back in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary risks in investing: Losing money and missed opportunities. It requires a balancing act for any portfolio (can’t eliminate both).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Stages of a Bull Market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The first, when a few forward-looking people begin to believe things will get better”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The second, when most investors realize improvement is actually taking place”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The third, when everyone concludes things will get better forever”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Stages of a Bear Market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The first, when just a few thoughtful investors recognize that, despite the prevailing bullishness, things won’t always be rosy”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The second, when most investors recognize things are deteriorating”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The third, when everyone’s convinced things can only get worse”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitraging human nature — exploited the common behavioral mistakes that lead to mispricing and inefficiencies in the market — can lead to above-average returns. Of course, it requires avoiding similar mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greed – the pursuit of profits above all else, without consideration of risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear – prevents investors from making rational decisions and taking rational actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Tendency to Dismiss Logic – when investors accept unlikely outcomes as probable because they would get rich quick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the Herd – people, in general, are more comfortable following a group than going it alone…even when they know it’s the wrong decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envy – people compare themselves to others too much…that includes returns. It makes it hard to watch others make more money in the stock market without eventually acting on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego – can lead to over-aggressive investing in the hopes of recognition, to show off high returns, or feel “smarter.” It leads to short term thinking. Humility is needed to keep the ego in check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitulation – the late behavior in all cycles is when the last holdouts give in and jump on the bandwagon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inadequate Skepticism – the recurring phrase “too good to be true” is repeated after every market bubble. A magically investment or strategy that produces high returns without risk doesn’t exist. A skeptic separates what’s too good to be true from what sounds good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of Being Wrong — when doubt pushes you to question your judgment on an investment because it declined in price (which is often the case when buying an underpriced asset) or you’re missing out on something that everyone else is making money on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All bubbles start with a grain of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrarianism means avoiding the repeated mistakes the herd makes at the extremes of the market cycle. The difficulty is in recognizing the extremes and then acting on it, knowing you’ll never time the bottom or top, or that prices can continue moving in the same direction longer than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the extremes, contrarianism is less likely to be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience might be the greatest teacher in recognizing the extremes of the market cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors must think in terms of probabilities when dealing with the future — what could happen and how likely is it to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to find bargains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something’s wrong — it looks bad on the surface like an over-leverage company, a failed project, or mismanagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misunderstood asset — investors don’t look deep enough to understand it and/or show a bias towards it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly unpopular – it’s ignored or scorned by the media, thus everyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controversial or inappropriate for most portfolios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s being sold the most?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, its price is falling — leading first-level thinkers to avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common mistake investors make is to equate action with adding value to a portfolio. Increased action usually just leads to overtrading and lower returns. Instead, investors should wait for the “best” opportunities to come to them — that they’re willing to act on — rather than chasing after things that add nominal value but carry more risk. This can be made worse by trying to create opportunities that don’t exist. Doing nothing is the hardest part of investing but often the most necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what you don’t know is essential to investing success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurately anticipating change is the most profitable but also the most difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of knowing what you don’t know is being careful with your own forecasts and those of others because nobody knows the future with absolute certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake investors make is forgetting the limits of their own knowledge. This includes mistaking the difference between probability and outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know the future, it’s best to be aggressive, make concentrated bets, use leverage, time the market, and ignore risk — all the things great investors warn about. Because the greats don’t know the future, they are defensive, diversify, hedge, focus on value over price, emphasize risk management, and prepare for multiple outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to figure out the future, try to figure out where we are in the market cycle, make adjustments if necessary when close to the extremes, and prepare mentally to avoid behavioral mistakes that plague investors throughout. The key is to watch for investor behavior that typically emerges, especially at the extremes of the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randomness or luck plays a bigger role in investing than most people want to admit. It’s how someone can bet on a long-shot lottery stock, win big, and look like a genius. But it has little to do with skill and a lot to do with luck. In the short run, any outcome is possible including the least probable. In the long run, bet hundreds or thousands of times, the total outcomes will approach what’s most probable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors’ decisions should be judged independent of the outcome because randomness allows for investors to make the wrong decision and still make money (or the right decision and lose). Process over outcomes is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good investment strategy essentially has a dial that can adjust the balance between “making money” and “avoiding losses.” Of course, turning the dial requires rational thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offensive investor is usually focused on aggressive investments/positions in order to outperform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defensive investor is usually focused on avoiding mistakes and not doing the wrong thing that leads to losses. For defensive investors, that means avoiding investments that have a high probability of losses and avoiding overexposure to big drawdowns in a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large margin of safety increases a portfolio’s tolerance for undesirable outcomes. A lower price — in relation to value — is the primary source of this margin. The lower the price, the wider the margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With stocks, the upside isn’t fixed like bonds. So the investor must find a balance between offense and defense. Obviously, they must play defense to avoid the losers, but must also play offense for the higher return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure of Imagination – Marks defines it as the inability to come up with a full range of outcomes and/or not completely understanding the consequences of those outcomes. Specifically, it’s in reference to extreme outliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding big losses means building a portfolio to protect from the possibility of unlikely terrible losses occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On asset correlation: “The failure to correctly anticipate co-movement within a portfolio is a critical source of investment error.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;george soros and reflexitity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“financial markets, far from accurately reflecting all the available knowledge, always provide a distorted view of reality. This is the principle of fallibility. The degree of distortion may vary from time to time. Sometimes, it’s quite insignificant, at other times, it is quite pronounced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Every bubble has 2 components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. When a positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, a boom-bust process is set in motion. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons from a Crisis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too much capital availability makes money flow to the wrong places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When capital goes where it shouldn’t, bad things happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When capital is in oversupply, investors compete for deals by accepting low returns and a slender margin for error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widespread disregard for risk creates great risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inadequate due diligence leads to investment losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In heady times, capital is devoted to innovative investments, many of which fail the test of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden fault lines running through portfolios can make the prices of seemingly unrelated assets move in tandem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychological and technical factors can swamp fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets change, invalidating models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage magnifies outcomes but doesn’t add value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excesses correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake investors make is selling at the bottom and missing the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any expectation of investment returns should be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every investor should have a return goal in mind, know the amount of risk they can tolerate, and the amount of liquidity their strategy requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When there’s nothing particularly clever to do, the potential pitfall lies in insisting on being clever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Asymmetry—better performance on the upside than on the downside relative to what your style alone would produce—should be every investor’s goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perfection in investing is generally unobtainable; the best we can hope for is to make a lot of good investments and exclude most of the bad ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most of these eleven lessons can be reduced to just one: be alert to what’s going on around you with regard to the supply/demand balance for investable funds and the eagerness to spend them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…we always think in terms of earnings yield (which is just the inverse of the P/E) rather than in P/Es; doing so allows for easy comparison to fixed-income alternatives.” — Christopher Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Short-run outcomes can diverge from the long-run probabilities, and occurrences can cluster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One way to maximize the asymmetry of risk and reward is to make sure you minimize risk. I’ve said this before in another place: if you minimize the chance of loss in an investment, most of the other alternatives are good.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investing scared, requiring good value and a substantial margin for error, and being conscious of what you don’t know and can’t control are hallmarks of the best investors I know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An investor needs to do very few things right as long as he avoids big mistakes.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In fixed income…returns are limited and the manager’s greatest contribution comes through the avoidance of loss. Because the upside is truly “fixed,” the only variability is on the downside, and avoiding it holds the key. Thus, distinguishing yourself as a bond investor isn’t a matter of which paying bonds you hold, but largely of whether you’re able to exclude bonds that don’t pay. According to Graham and Dodd, this emphasis on exclusion makes fixed income investing a negative art.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here is part of the tradeoff with diversification. You must be diversified enough to survive bad times or bad luck so that skill and good process can have the chance to pay off over the long term.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For good investors, as the time horizon expands, which allows skill to come into play, the probability distribution of long-term returns should narrow.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overestimating what you’re capable of knowing or doing can be extremely dangerous—in brain surgery, transocean racing or investing. Acknowledging the boundaries of what you can know—and working within those limits rather than venturing beyond—can give you a great advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what’s going on.” — Amos Tversky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of the biggest losses occur when overconfidence regarding predictive ability causes investors to underestimate the range of possibilities, the difficulty of predicting which one will materialize, and the consequences of a surprise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good times teach only bad lessons: that investing is easy, that you know its secrets, and that you needn’t worry about risk. The most valuable lessons are learned in tough times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beating the market matters, but limiting risk matters just as much. Ultimately, investors have to ask themselves whether they are interested in relative or absolute returns. Losing 45 percent while the market drops 50 percent qualifies as market outperformance, but what a pyrrhic victory this would be for most of us.” — Seth Klarman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First-level thinking says, “I think the company’s earnings will fall; sell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Second-level thinking says, “I think the company’s earnings will fall less than people expect, and the pleasant surprise will lift the stock; buy.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea is that agreeing with the broad consensus, while a very comfortable place for most people to be, is not generally where above-average profits are found.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Psychological influences are a dominating factor governing investor behavior. They matter as much as—and at times more than—underlying value in determining securities prices.” — Seth Klarman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human beings are not clinical computing machines. Rather, most people are driven by greed, fear, envy, and other emotions that render objectivity impossible and open the door for significant mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many of the best bargains at any point in time are found among the things other investors can’t or won’t do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let others believe markets can never be beat. Abstention on the part of those who won’t venture in creates opportunities for those who will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Warren Buffett says that the best investment course would teach just two things well: How to value an investment and how to think about market price movements.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to consistently do the right thing as an investor. But it’s impossible to consistently do the right thing at the right time. The most we value investors can hope for is to be right about an asset’s value and buy when it’s available for less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unless you buy at the exact bottom tick (which is next to impossible), you will be down at some point after you make every investment.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are two essential ingredients for profit in a declining market: you have to have a view on intrinsic value, and you have to hold that view strongly enough to be able to hang in and buy even as price declines suggest that you’re wrong. Oh yes, there’s a third: you have to be right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investment success doesn’t come from “buying good things,” but rather from “buying things well.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been demonstrated time and time again that no asset is so good that it can’t become a bad investment if bought at too high a price. And there are few assets so bad that they can’t be a good investment when bought cheap enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no such thing as a good or bad idea regardless of price!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investing is a popularity contest, and the most dangerous thing is to buy something at the peak of its popularity. At that point, all favorable facts and opinions are already factored into its price, and no new buyers are left to emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Risk means more things can happen than will happen.” — Elroy Dimson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most dangerous investment conditions generally stem from psychology that’s too positive. For this reason, fundamentals don’t have to deteriorate in order for losses to occur; a downgrading of investor opinion will suffice. High prices often collapse of their own weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the relation between different kinds of investments and the risk of loss is entirely too indefinite, and too variable with changing conditions, to permit of sound mathematical formulation.” — Security Analysis, Graham and Dodd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of the greatest losses arise when investors ignore the improbable possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big difference between probability and outcome. Probable things fail to happen—and improbable things happen—all the time.” — Bruce Newberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unusual and unlikely things can happen, and outcomes can occur in runs (and go to extremes) that are hard to predict. Underestimating uncertainty and its consequences is a big contributor to investor difficulty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The received wisdom is that risk increases in the recessions and falls in booms. In contrast, it may be more helpful to think of risk as increasing during upswings, as financial imbalances build up, and materializing in recessions.” — Andrew Crockett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Risk cannot be eliminated; it just gets transferred and spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The road to long-term investment success runs through risk control more than through aggressiveness. Over a full career, most investors’ results will be determined more by how many losers they have, and how bad they are, than by the greatness of their winners. Skillful risk control is the mark of the superior investor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rule number one: most things will prove to be cyclical. Rule number two: some of the greatest opportunities for gain and loss come when other people forget rule number one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding that cycles are eventually self-correcting is one way to maintain some optimism when bargain hunting after large market drops.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When things are going well, extrapolation introduces great risk. Whether it’s company profitability, capital availability, price gains, or market liquidity, things that inevitably are bound to regress toward the mean are often counted on to improve forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stocks are cheapest when everything looks grim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The desire for more, the fear of missing out, the tendency to compare against others, the influence of the crowd and the dream of the sure thing—-these factors are near universal. Thus they have a profound collective impact on most investors and most markets. The result is mistakes, and those mistakes are frequent, widespread and recurring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing is easier than self-deceit. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be true.” — Demosthenes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest investing errors come not from factors that are informational or analytical, but from those that are psychological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many of the mistakes I have made are the same ones that I had made before; they just look a little different each time—the same mistake slightly disguised.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rising prices are a narcotic that affects the reasoning power up and down the line.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tendency to compare results is one of the most invidious. The emphasis on relative returns over absolute returns shows how psychology can distort the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my view, the road to investment success is usually marked by humility, not ego.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage, but provides the greatest profit.” — John Templeton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investment success requires sticking with positions made uncomfortable by their variance with popular opinion.” — David Swensen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people seem to think outstanding performance to date presages outstanding future performance. Actually, it’s more likely that outstanding performance to date has borrowed from the future and thus presages subpar performance from here on out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are two primary elements in superior investing: seeing some quality that others don’t see or appreciate (and that isn’t reflected in the price), and having it turn out to be true (or at least accepted by the market).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investment is the discipline of relative selection.” — Sid Cottle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal isn’t to find good assets, but good buys. Thus, it’s not what you buy; it’s what you pay for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investment bargains needn’t have anything to do with high quality. In fact, things tend to be cheaper if low quality has scared people away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The market’s not a very accommodating machine; it won’t provide high returns just because you need them.” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Patient opportunism—waiting for bargains—is often your best strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

His diary recorded the effect the Great Depression, the economy, and financial markets had on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book covers the time period from 1931 to 1941.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Great Depression
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate performed almost as badly as stocks. Many properties were bought using 2 to 3 mortgages at the end of the 1920s. Foreclosures were common, but the illiquid nature of real estate and lack of buyers made it impossible for banks to sell, which contributed to later bank failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks and Savings &amp;#x26; Loan companies did everything possible to not go under. Roth recorded that they suspended payments on savings and demanded a 60-day notice on withdrawals. Runs were common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 prevented European countries from trading freely with the US. In retaliation, European countries raised tariffs against US goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vegetable gardens became popular to save money, which lowered the demand/price of produce and made it harder for farmers to make money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout 1931 and 1932 Roth repeats something similar to: “It hardly seems possible that things could get worse.” And it does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank closures and Savings &amp;#x26; Loan closures locally and nationally were initially a shock but became a common occurrence in the diary from 1931 to 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little money was in circulation due to bank failures and the inability to withdraw. Business was at a standstill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A moratorium on mortgages was considered in many states in 1931.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety deposit boxes replaced savings accounts for those who could get money out of the banks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;President Hoover believed a sense of volunteer charity and community service would take care of the unemployment problem. He believed the local governments were responsible to feed and employ workers and the federal government should stay out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank and Savings &amp;#x26; Loan passbooks became a currency of sorts. Passbooks sold as low as 30 cents on the dollar. Prices on passbooks were quoted in the daily newspapers and traded at local brokerage houses. Many people used passbooks to buy foreclosed property from banks and speculate in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roth noticed that roll-your-own cigarettes, pipe smoking, and packed lunches were ways people saved money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small gambling games became a popular pastime during the depression — Whiffle board, dime chain letters, betting on the number of stock sales or bank clearings on the day, crossword puzzle, Monopoly, etc. “People lost all confidence in the old virtues of saving. They were willing to bet small amounts in the hope of getting large returns. They wanted something to occupy their minds and they wanted some gamble to buoy their hopes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;England, Denmark, and Norway went off the gold standard in 1931.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan went to war with China in 1931.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Reconstruction Finance Corp. was created under Hoover in 1931 to lend financial support to banks, railroads, and other businesses but came too late for Hoover. It was used extensively under FDR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Postal savings accounts became another popular alternative to bank accounts. Postal savings accounts were limited to $2,500 and deposits could be converted to postal savings bonds that paid interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimates of 25% of eligible Americans were unemployed in 1932. Those who had a job saw hours and wages cut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of banks failed during Hoover’s presidency. Of that, 2,294 failed in 1931. Almost 5,000 small banks shut down during the 1920s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash was scarce. People couldn’t buy food, pay bills, businesses couldn’t pay workers, and banks wouldn’t accept checks they couldn’t cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Scrip” became a common cash substitute issued by local governments or businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double Liability – state governments mandated, in the early 19th century, that bank shareholders were liable for the amount of money invested and the value of the shares they owned. In other words, if the bank failed, shareholders could lose more money than they invested. The goal was to prevent banks from taking unnecessary risks with deposits. Widespread bank failures hit bank shareholders hardest and proved the rules were useless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks became desperate. In one account, they tried to raise funds by urging depositors to buy new stock in the bank with 25% of their deposits and the agreement to leave their deposits alone for a fixed period of 1 to 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farmers expanded their farms and bought new equipment, often by borrowing against their property, in order to meet growing demand during WWI. The Great Depression put an end to demand, farmers couldn’t afford to pay their loans. Farm foreclosures grew in 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 countries went off the gold standard by the end of 1931. France and US were the only two large countries still on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50,000 WWI veterans camped out in Washington D.C. to demand bonus pay in June 1932. Things grew violent in July after Congress rejected an early release of veteran’s bonuses. The veterans were driven out of the city by the army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local governments had little money to operate schools, courts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR was elected in November 1932 by a landslide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40% of home mortgages were in default in 1933. Farms were hit hard by foreclosure. It led to farmers protesting low commodity prices and sabotaging farm auctions — farmers showed up en masse at auctions to intimidate anyone who bid on farms, to ensure the farmer who previously owned the property won the auction. Many farmers repurchased their farms via auction for pennies on the dollar. States eventually passed moratoriums on foreclosures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US dollar suffered severe deflation during the depression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan Governor orders a bank holiday in the state on February 14, 1933, after the largest bank in the state failed. The order closed banks for 8 days. Upon reopening, banks limit withdrawals to 5% of deposits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maryland orders a bank holiday on February 25, 1933, with similar withdrawal limits upon reopening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio banks ordered a bank holiday and set 5% withdrawal limits on accounts on February 27, 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pennsylvania ordered a bank holiday on February 28, 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By March 1, 1933, eight states ordered bank holidays. On March 2, the total was up to 16 states. March 3, it increased to 22 states. FDR proclaimed a national bank holiday from March 6 to March 9. Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 on March 9. Banks are allowed to reopen based on how “sound” they are. Stock markets also closed for 10 days during the bank holiday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR begins his fireside chats in March 1933 to help explain the situation and instill confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail sales jumped with end of the national bank holiday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US economy stopped contracting in March 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR signed a bill allowing beer and light wines (3.2% alcohol) in March 1933. Prohibition (18th Amendment) was officially repealed on December 5, 1933. Legalized liquor didn’t help the recovery as much as many thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR signed an order to limit ownership of gold in April 1933. No one can own more than $100 in gold. Gold exports are also not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hitler comes to power in 1933 and immediately declares a boycott of Jewish merchants to worldwide outrage. — April 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflation is the new worry of the day (1933). Inflation worries make regular reappearances throughout the rest of Roth’s diary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Industrial Recovery Act was passed in June 1933. It was designed to eliminate unfair competitive practices and standardized wages and work hours between companies in the same industries. It also granted the right for workers to unionize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labor strikes became common in late 1933 as union workers demand higher wages. The National Guard are called and some end in violence and death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Federation of Labor saw its membership grow from 500,000 to over 4 million in less than 2 months ending Oct. 1933. It demanded a 30-hour work week and higher wages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civil Works Administration is created in November 1933 to provide federal jobs to the unemployed to build roads, parks, airports, etc. By December, 3.5 million people had jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail reports, in 1933, the best Christmas sales since the depression started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1933 saw a number of programs set up by FDR’s administration: FDIC and Home Owners Loan Corp. were two of the most successful. The FDIC federally insured bank deposits. Home Owners Loan Corp. allowed homeowners to refinance their home with a 12-year mortgage instead of the common 5-year mortgage and avoid foreclosure. The program refinanced about 20% of home mortgages at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR’s experiment devaluing gold begins in January 1934.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential signs of war in Europe on February 1934.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1934 saw an increase in union strikes — over 1,800 — for better wages and working environment. National Guard and police were often called in to break up the strike, ending in violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1935 saw FDR’s administration pass Works Progress Administration which employed 8.5 million people, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Social Security Act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany seized the Rhine Valley in March 1936.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were still about 12 million unemployed in April 1936.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR wins reelection by a landslide in November 1936.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany seizes Austria in March 1938.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;War breaks out in Europe. Germany invades Poland in September 1939. England and France declare war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR’s administration would shift to national defense and supply Great Britain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italy joins the war, allied with Germany, in June 1940 while Germany takes control of Paris. Only England is left. Air raids over London begin. People are worried should England also falls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan allies with Germany and Italy in September 1940.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Selective Training and Service Act was passed in September 1940. It requires all men aged 21 to 35 to register for the draft. 16 million men registered for the first draft in US history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR wins his 3rd reelection by a landslide in November 1940.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany turns toward Russia in July 1941.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The war created panic buying of products in the US starting in 1939 to avoid potential rationing and embargos on products similar to WWI. First, it was cars and real estate, next was furniture, appliances, radios, then silk stockings, linens, and clothes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan attacks Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941. The US declares war on Japan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany and Italy declare war on the US on December 11, 1941.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Markets
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only around 2.5% of Americans owned stocks in 1929.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people at the time viewed real estate as the way to grow a fortune.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following WWI, the US helped rebuild Europe and became its primary supplier which kicked off a boom in the US. Things picked up steam after 1922 as new industries like electricity, autos, and radio, along with mass production, became more mainstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chain store retailers — Kroger, A&amp;#x26;P, and others — grew in size during the 1920s and knocked many “mom and pop” retailers out of business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florida’s real estate boom took off in 1925.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the ’29 Crash, stocks sold at 20x to 40x earnings, bonds paid 4% to 5% interest, and use of margin was widespread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the crash, business leaders, politicians, and newspapers urged people that stocks were bargains and the worst was over. It wasn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks were 30% lower one year later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate bonds sold at 20 to 30 cents on the dollar in September 1931.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who thought they bought bargains in 1930, watched those bargains get cut in half (at least) by 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congress started an investigation on short selling in 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks and commodities fell to the same level in 1899 in May 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Railroad sector averages hit the same level in 1904 on May 31, 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Railroad stocks were up almost 400% by September 1932 from their lows in July 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market rose four months straight following the end of the national bank holiday in early March 1933. New brokerage offices began to open. Roth reports people buying stocks in the hope to make back losses from prior years. Markets would see record volume on the year in the back half of 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market corrects in July 1933 after 3 straight days of losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. Panics: “1873-1879 Major panic. Recovery in 1879. 1880-1884 Good times. 1884-1885 Short panic. 1885-1890 Good times. 1891-1893 Falling prices and warning of panic. 1893-1896 Panic. 1897-1901 Good times. 1901-1902 Short panic. 1902-1907 Good times 1907-1908 Short panic but severe. 1908-1914 Good times. 1914 Panic threatened but stopped by war. 1914-1921 Wartime prosperity. 1921 Primary war panic. 1922-1929 Good times. 1929-1935 Panic.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federal Reserve sets margin limits at 55% in January 1936.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks sold at 30 to 40 times earnings in September 1936.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market continued to rise until September 1937. Black Tuesday hit on October 19, 1937. The market fell more than 50% from September to December 1937, down to the same level as 1935.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By March 1938, the stock market is back to the same level as in 1934.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market bottomed in June 1938.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks hit 2-year lows in June 1940.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock Exchange seats sold at $650,000 in 1929. A seat was sold in November 1940 for $33,000. Another sold for $27,000 in February 1941. Another sold for $19,000 in December 1941.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Tax selling” pushes the stock market down to levels not seen since 1938. — December 6 1941&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing Thoughts
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roth dances around the idea of market timing early on — i.e. getting out entirely at the top and back in at the bottom — before realizing the difficulty of predicting the turns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The beginning of a stock market movement usually is caused by the trend of business but in the end the movement is carried too high or too low — by the extreme optimism or despair of human nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A major risk should not be taken for a minor profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The investor must organize all the material around him so he can use it in a simple way. He must disregard the non-essential. He must discipline himself and realize that the investment of surplus funds is all-important and requires work and diligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both 1932 and 1938 indicate there is no sure way to catch the bottom of the swing because it comes without warning. When liquidation has dried up and the situation looks hopeless—that is the turn. Your guess is as good as anybody’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It becomes increasingly clear that nobody can predict the future behavior of the stock market. One day the results of the election upset it and the next day it booms because of some chance happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fools rush in to buy when the market is booming — the wise investor buys on darker days when he knows stocks are selling below value — and then holds on — confident that he cannot lose his principal and that sooner or later the market will come back and raise prices above their intrinsic value. To do this an investor must have liquid capital, courage and above all patience and ability to hold on and wait.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stock broker after 40 years experience said to me today: “The only people I know who ever made money in the stock market are those who bought for cash and owned the stocks outright. I do not recall a single margin trader who did not lose sooner or later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing is clear. Every speculator gets washed out sooner or later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Roth’s diary is a reminder that our economic security, individually and collectively, always rests on a complex interaction of market forces, politics, consumer perception, and the impact of unforeseen (and sometimes unforeseeable) events. As in so many other areas, those offering predictions for the future or even detailed readings of the present are often wrong because of incomplete information, flawed statistical models, or hidden agendas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has become popular to wear old clothes—to brag about poverty and how much you lost in the 1929 crash. It is almost bad taste to give a big party or to drive a new car.” — Sept. 1, 1931&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Banks are absolutely terrible in their insistence on payments on notes and mortgages. It is the old story of lending you an umbrella when the sun is shining and then demanding it back when it rains.” — Sept. 4, 1931&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Life insurance proved to be a cushion for me in the depression. Money borrowed on life insurance policies should be paid back as quickly as possible. It has so far proven to be the next best investment after government bonds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everybody demands cash — no checks are accepted. The Truscon Steel Co. paid its employees with checks drawn on a large New York Bank and the local banks refused to cash them. The check may be good today and bad tomorrow. Even certified checks are regarded suspiciously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 146 cities of the United States “scrip” money is being used or “barter exchanges” have been set up to exchange services for merchandise.” — December 1932&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past two years there has been an amazing change in American thought from cards and golf to national politics and public matters. Life has become simple. Women’s styles resemble the 1890s and even the bicycle is coming back into favor as a means of transportation.” — May 1933&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I started these notes it never occurred to me that the depression would last more than two years. We are now in the beginning of the seventh year and the road is not yet clear — with the possibility of inflation ahead. We seem to be emerging from the panic, industry is picking up, etc. — but so much of it has been created by artificial spending that it is difficult to know just where we stand.” — January 2, 1936&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just came back thru the stores on my lunch hour. People are spending money like drunken sailors.” — December 24, 1936&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Religious intolerance increases — and our country is swayed by European propaganda and subversive activities. All in all the world of 1940 is not a pleasant one. We can only hope that a better day is dawning.” — January 1940&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blackouts take place in New York and Los Angeles. Many false reports of invasion by Japanese planes.” — December 9, 1941&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To an older man it must have seemed inevitable that we were heading for a crash but to most of us it seemed that we were in a “New Era” which would never end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 1929 when the crash came all sorts of people were into the market on margins over their heads — doctors, lawyers, merchants, bootblacks, waitresses, etc. They bought stocks on tips, did not know what the company sold or made and did not know how to investigate a stock even if such a thought had occurred to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Magazines and newspapers are full of articles telling people to buy stocks, real estate etc. at present bargain prices. They say that times are sure to get better and that many big fortunes have been built this way. The trouble is that nobody has any money… From the extreme of speculation in 1929 people have now turned to the extreme of caution.” — July 30, 1931&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a great many instances fraud is shown on the part of bank officials who used bank funds to play the stock market. The whole banking fraternity is in public disfavor and many of them face prison.” — Sept. 29, 1931&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A portion of good old government bonds is the backbone of many an investment list today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All sense of value, optimism and initiative seems to have disappeared. That is why the depression period presents so many opportunities to the man who has the nerve to buy stocks and real estate and businesses when the outlook is the blackest.” — April 14, 1932&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“O.P.M. (Other People’s Money—or credit) are the three most powerful letters in business but must be wisely and moderately used. Most of the banks are now almost liquid and these vast resources will soon again be loaned out for business expansion. To use these funds for business expansion and yet with moderation is the height of good business management.”
“The bottom was reached in summer 1932 and the upturn gradually started. There had been so many false starts however that it was not until 1934-5 that people really realized that the turn had been passed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Florida in particular is absolutely flat since the land boom of 1925. Literally whole communities can be bought up with little cash.” — July 1932&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the last 30 days the stock market has given one of the most strenuous rallies in its history… There is no tangible explanation for this by way of industrial revival and yet there is plenty of optimism and feeling that this fall will see a turn for the period. In this 30 day period most of the popular common stocks have doubled and tripled in value. The entire list shows a 70% increase in value.” — August 1932&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Directly after the war period it became popular for small local concerns to expand by selling stocks to the public. In almost every single instance these investments have proven to be worthless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bankruptcy receiverships and foreclosures are rapidly cutting down the mountain of debt created during the boom… In the case of the large corporation it is often voluntary for the purpose of breaking leases and getting rid of large bond issues, cutting down heavy capitalization etc. I do not see how real recovery can come until this liquidation movement is completed, old debts wiped out and business showing a profit on the basis of present capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 1928 people were excited about big profits on the stock market: they read literature about investments, lived high and talked about the “new era.” Today their outlook is gloomy, they think the depression will never end, the stock market is an abomination, real estate is no good, everybody is cynical, etc. Just as the public was mistaken in its excessive optimism of 1928 I believe it is mistaken in its excessive gloom.” — February 1933&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stock market lays down stringent rules to curb the small speculator. Hereafter accounts under $5000 must be margined at least 50%. Pools must be reported.” — August 1933&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The street is full of stories of large sums of money made in the stock market. Most of these people bought stocks a year or more ago and held on grimly… Many of course sold too soon and took a small profit. The speculative fever has spread just as in 1929 and all sorts of people are crowding the broker’s office. Many stocks sell at 20 and 30 times earnings and a break seems overdue. Bonds pay only about 3% and because of this low return and because of fear of inflation much money has been switched to equities.” — February 1936&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I look back over the record of the stock market since 1932 many remarkable results can be seen. Stocks that sold at receivership prices are now selling at substantial values. Here are a few extreme examples showing quotations in 1932 and 1936. Phillips Morris Tobacco Co. 1/2 to 90; Sheet &amp;#x26; Tube 4 to 68; Republic Steel 2 to 26; Gen. Motors 10 to 70; Chrysler 6 to 100, etc.” — July 1936&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I re-read some of the predictions made by outstanding economists in past few years, I must laugh. They were all wrong. None of them foresaw the 1937-39 collapses…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Industry in a war boom — stock market stagnant — gov’t bonds bringing less than 1% and selling at a high premium — stocks low and selling at five times earnings” — February 1941&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The S.E.C. starts to break up the utility holding companies and their common stocks go to record lows.” — April 1941&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rules of conservative investment apply whether you buy real estate or stocks or bonds. Thorough investigation is the first necessity — safety of the principal — and it usually follows that only a fair return on the investment can be expected. To seek a high or unusual return means greater risk and speculation… A pretty safe rule to follow is to stick to the conservative investments. There are times, however, in a depression when cash money is king and many good investments can be purchased at a big discount.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As nearly as I can make out from a study of past panics, the cycle of business is always moving down toward a panic or up toward a boom. It rarely for long travels in a straight line… The wise investor will disregard the day-by-day fluctuations of the stock market or real estate market and base his buying and selling on these long periods of rise and fall. Above all, and I repeat it again and again — he must have liquid capital in time of depression to buy the bargains and then he must sell before the next crash. It is difficult if not impossible to do this but the conservative longtime investor who follows the general rule of buying stocks when they are selling far below their intrinsic value and nobody wants them, and of selling his stocks when people are bidding frantically for them at prices far above their intrinsic value — such an investor will pretty nearly hit the bull’s-eye.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again and again I am forced to the conclusion that in prosperous times a man must be cautious and preserve his capital and be careful not to over-expand his business or to go too deeply in debt relying on a continuation of good business to pay the debt. In time of depression a man can be brave and if the depression is nearing an end he can invest his money or expand his business or open a new business with confidence that he is facing 5 or 10 years of prosperity… Many great prosperous businesses were founded on the ruins of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Money should be invested not locally but on a national scale if possible, including stocks and bonds in companies located in other communities and operating nationally. Many wealthy families in Youngstown grew rich on only local industries and banks but they are pretty well cleaned out now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each day brings new and interesting stories of great fortunes wiped out in the past year… The stories run without end. It all comes to the same point. Every investor should at all times have a reasonable portion of his holdings in liquid securities that can’t shrink much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is my conclusion that the successful investor must cultivate the habit of “patience.”… I suppose the real investor would then have the patience and courage to wait until normal times returned before selling. Patience to wait for the right moment—courage to buy or sell when that time arrives — and liquid capital — these are the 3 essentials as I see it now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again and again during this depression it is driven home to me that opportunity is a stern goddess who passes up those who are unprepared with liquid capital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This seems to be the sound rule for obtaining wealth but it requires patience which few possess:
Live on less than you earn — save at least 10%.
Invest, don’t speculate so that none of the principal is lost. Re-invest the earnings.
Never sell a good stock unless the price is above its intrinsic value (as in 1929).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is said that George F. Baker, the New York Banker, will always buy sound common stocks when they are being offered below intrinsic value and then he will never sell them except for very good reasons. He looks for his profit in the growth of the company rather than in the speculative increase of the market quotation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just finished reading a book called Mellon’s Millions. In all their business ventures they conservatively built up huge cash surpluses during time of prosperity. When a panic came they were able to absorb competitors for a song. During prosperous days their corporations advanced steadily but during depression they advanced by leaps and bounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just finished reading a book entitled Our Mysterious Panics by Colman. He gives brief history of every panic from 1819 to 1929. Comes to conclusion that every panic is brought on by human greed and speculation instead of by complex economic cycles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“None of these people seem to know the first principles of investment — how to gauge the value of a stock or how to look for accurate information. They buy and sell on tips and since the market has been rising since 1932 they are coming out ahead. They lay nothing aside in bonds. I wonder how many of them will be able to get out at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Floyd Odlum and the building up of his Atlas Investment Trust. Started with $40,000 in 1924 — ran it up to a million in 1929. Sold out for cash and held on to cash until bottom of depression was reached in 1932. With his cash he bought heavily in “special situations.” Mostly in investment trusts hard up for cash. Stocks in these trusts were selling at less than 50% of the asset values… Assets of the Atlas Corporation are now over $100,000,000 and they have literally become private bankers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is funny how when the stock market is rising every piece of news is regarded optimistically and bad news is ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This depression has indelibly impressed on my mind one thing — and that is the value of having on hand sufficient capital to cover emergencies. In the investment field it means the difference between success or failure to have enough capital to buy bargains when they are available or to hold on to investments thru thick and thin and not be forced to sell at a loss. My experience as a lawyer shows that a large proportion of business failures are caused by lack of capital rather than by lack of technical business knowledge. Even in domestic life there can be no happiness without sufficient surplus to cover emergencies such as illness or death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To build an estate it is necessary first of all to get money by saving it and secondly it is most important to invest these savings so that they will increase and work for you without losing the principal. Most people learn the first rule and succeed in saving various amounts out of their earnings but very few learn the second rule — how to invest it so it earns a profit and yet not lose the principal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Somewhere in between the ultra-conservative man who is afraid to take even a legitimate risk and the avaricious gambler who bets on anything — stands the ideal investor who has learned to make his money work for him. He accumulates money first by savings — then he carefully investigates and weighs a dozen investments before he finally selects one to put his money in. He is willing to take a legitimate risk but is not willing to gamble… If he invests in stocks or bonds he will not follow blind tips or rush into a seething market with thousands of suckers — but in the quiet of his office he will carefully examine the earnings records of the company, its future prospects. He will seek advice if necessary and then buy only if he thinks the price is fair and the prospects good. He will hold on for several years and share in the growth of the company and will sell only if the company loses ground or if a stock-crazy public offers him much more for his stock than its intrinsic value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As long as human nature is the same and people like to speculate, it is probable that in the future, economic booms and depressions will come and go as in the past.”
“During the past depression prominent bankers, businessmen, etc. were all wrong in most of their predictions. Use your own judgment and do your own thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more I see of the recent stock market slump the more I am impressed with the fact that the American people look upon the stock market as a place to gamble and not to invest. In times of rising market the average American becomes over-optimistic: he invests his whole capital in common stocks of the most speculative variety; often extends himself on margin. Then when a slump comes he finds himself over-extended; no cash reserve to fall back upon; he becomes unduly pessimistic and sells at a loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The average man who buys real estate for investment makes a careful study of the property, the location, the income, etc. and hires a lawyer to examine the title… That same man when he buys stocks either will not investigate because he does not know how or because he is lazy. He bets his money as in a horse race and does not feel his venture a success unless his money is doubled in a very short time. If the patience and care used in a real estate investment were used in making a stock investment, there would be much greater chance of success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is hard to always judge the exact place in a cycle but it is fairly easy to know whether we are in a period of great prosperity and speculation or in a period of blackness and despair. It is most difficult to know when the turn comes. It is best not to wait for the turn but to follow the simple theory of buying when a security is selling below value and to sell when above value.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Ruane&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Do not borrow money to buy stocks.” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You don’t act rationally when you’re investing borrowed money.” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I firmly believe that nobody knows what the market will do… The important thing is to find an attractive idea and invest in a company that’s cheap.” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I try to learn as much as I can about seven or eight good ideas. If you really find something very cheap, why not put fifteen percent of your money in it?” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I don’t know anybody who can really do a good job investing in a lot of stocks except Peter Lynch.” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Most people would be much better off with an index fund.” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mohnish Pabrai&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biggest lesson from his parents: not seeing them get rattled after losing money multiple times. His father was an optimist, always founding new businesses that eventually went bankrupt. Losing didn’t distract his father from trying again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloning: Pabrai studied the best investors, figured out why they were successful then cloned (copied) their approach (studying is a huge part to make sure he clones the right things). He did for more than just investing strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He gets investment ideas by searching through 13F’s of the top investors, looks at the top holdings, studies the stocks, and tries to figure out why it’s a top holding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pabrai cloned Buffett’s 3 core concepts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying a stock means buying a piece of a business with a value, not a piece of paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That value of the businesses is not always reflected in stock prices (Graham’s voting vs. weighing machine). The key is to stay disconnected from the market’s craziness and patiently wait for mispriced opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy stocks only when it’s selling at a discount to that value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pabrai theorizes that Buffett’s online bridge playing acts as a positive mental distraction that keeps him from trading Berkshire’s portfolio. We all have a bias towards action that can use distracting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Buffett’s stock analysis: “What he’s looking for is a reason to say no, and as soon as he finds that, he’s done.” — Pabrai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pabrai’s Stock Filters (cloned from Buffett):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circle of Competence: Only invest in companies you truly understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin of Safety: Only invest in companies trading at a deep — “no brainer” — discount from its true value. “I have very simple criteria: if something is not going to be an obvious double in a short period of time — you know, two or three years — I have no interest.” — Pabrai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive Advantage: Look for better businesses rather than just cheap businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too Hard: Avoid companies with financial statements that are difficult to understand. It should be easy to figure out how the business makes money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He avoids companies based in countries with questionable shareholder rights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He avoids startups and IPOs. The added hype makes it less likely to find bargains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He avoids short selling because the upside is only 100% but the downside is unlimited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He ignores macroeconomics. It’s too complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He avoids meeting the management of companies he owns. Avoids being biased by sales speak and unreliable information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inner Scorecard: live by the standards you set for yourself and stop worrying about what others might think of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key isn’t to get rich, it’s financial independence — to do what you want to do without money constraints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Templeton&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templeton recognized early that a home country bias (investing only in the U.S.) was too limiting. He invested everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templeton bought stock in 104 U.S. companies, trading at $1 or less, in 1939 at the brink of WWII based on the theory that companies would see huge demand if war broke out. He invested $100 per stock. He made money on 100 out of 104 stocks — a total of 5x his money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templeton’s Principles:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware Emotion: “Most people get led astray by emotions in investing. They get led astray by being excessively careless and optimistic when they have big profits, and by getting excessively pessimistic and too cautious when they have big losses.” — Templeton
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploit the Irrationality in Markets: “To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are enthusiastically buying is the most difficult. But it pays the greatest rewards.” — Templeton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware Ignorance: Buy what you understand and never stop learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversify Broadly: “Don’t put all your money with any one expert. Don’t put all your money in any one industry or any one nation. Nobody is that smart. So the wise thing is to diversify.” — Templeton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be Patient: The edge is in waiting. Too many investors are too impatient to wait for opportunities and too impatient to wait for results to play out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find Bargains: “…study whichever assets have performed most dismally in the past five years, then to assess whether the cause of those woes is temporary or permanent.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid Fads: “The best way for an investor to avoid popular delusions is to focus not on outlook but on value.” — Templeton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templeton shorted 84 internet stocks, selling at triple its IPO price during the Dotcom Bubble on the theory that insiders would dump their shares after the lockup period ended. He bet $2.2 million on each stock ($185 million total) and made $90 million when the bubble burst. His strategy was to place short bets 7 days before the lockup expiration and cover the bets 10 days after expiration. He also had a rule in place to cover if the stocks rose a certain amount (to protect from excessive losses).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Howard Marks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay Humble: Marks reminds himself of the role luck has played in his life. He keeps a list of the lucky breaks he’s had to help him stay humble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find Inefficiencies: “The more a market is studied and followed and embraced and popularized, the less there should be bargains around for the asking.” — Marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy Cheap: “the essential question to ask about any potential investment should be ‘Is it cheap?‘”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets are Cyclical: markets, the economy, etc. follow a pattern of cycles. Yet investors tend to expect the current trend to continue in a straight line. They fail to see the trend reverting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He avoids forecasters (they can’t predict the future), market timing, and fads (rarely cheap).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always ask: How much optimism is priced in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marks collects examples of “stupid deals” to keep track of the frequency of craziness, greed, lowering of standards, etc. in markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“He asks himself questions such as Are investors appropriately skeptical and risk-averse or are they ignoring risks and happily paying up? Are valuations reasonable relative to historical standards? Are deal structures fair to investors? Is there too much faith in the future?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I always look at things in terms of ‘Where’s the mistake? Is the mistake in buying or not buying?’ ” — Marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Both in markets and life, the goal isn’t to embrace risk or eschew it, but to bear it intelligently while never forgetting the possibility of an unpleasant outcome.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Our performance doesn’t come from what we buy or sell. It comes from what we hold. So the main activity is holding, not buying and selling. I’ve always wondered if it wouldn’t enhance an organization to say, ‘We only trade on Thursdays.’ And the other four days of the week, all you can do is sit and think.” — Marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If your thinking is heavily colored by wishful thinking, then your probability assignments will be biased toward favorable… If you’re given to fear, then you’ll be biased toward the negative… No one is going to say, ‘This is my prediction and it’s probably wrong.’ But you must say, ‘This is my expectation and I have to be aware of the likelihood that it’s colored by my emotional bias.’ And you have to resist it. For me, that means not to chicken out when the going gets tough.” — Marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jean-Marie Eveillard&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eveillard followed Ben Graham’s philosophy: minimize risk because the future is unpredictable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He took over the SoGen International mutual fund in 1979 (part of Société Générale). It had $15 million in assets. It was renamed the First Eagle Global Fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He looked for a margin of safety of 30% to 40% and held over 100 stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On why he was diversified: “I’m too skeptical about my own skills and too worried that it could just blow up.” — Eveillard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fund’s returns were great until the Dot-com bubble. The fund underperformed from 1997 to 1999 and 70% of its shareholders left. Evelliard stuck to his strategy despite the pressure from shareholders, bosses, and career risk. Société Générale sold the fund in Oct. 1999. Evelliard crushed it from 2000 to 2002.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eveillard retired in 2008 and passed control of the First Eagle Global Fund to Matthew McLennan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;McLennan follows a similar strategy — looks for at least a 30% margin of safety and owns over 100 stocks in the funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Our goal is not to try to become rich quickly. It’s resilient wealth creation.” — McLennan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal directs every investment decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Risk: just because something has never happened, doesn’t mean it can’t happen. We must be prepared for the possibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We just want to acknowledge that there are things that may not play out so well in the future. You want to be structured to participate in the march of mankind, but to survive the dips along the way.” — McLennan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I happen to believe that everything is on a path to fade. If you think of evolution, ninety-nine percent of species that have ever existed are extinct. And businesses are no exception.” — McLennan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Businesses that were robust today won’t be robust in the future. Uncertainty is intrinsic to the system. It’s entropy — the second law of thermodynamics. Basically, things tend toward disorder over time, and it takes a lot of energy to keep structure and quality in place. So, philosophically, we have great respect for the fact that things are not structurally permanent in nature, that things fade.” — McLennan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets are biological. Businesses are born, evolve, and die. Investors should evolve (their thinking and strategies) along with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;McLennan builds his portfolio by eliminating anything that leads to mistakes — fads, countries with unstable political systems or a history of seizing corporate property, businesses with a high risk of tech disruption, excess leverage, complex financial statements, and questionable/adventurous management (he says no a lot). What’s left are businesses that tend to persist (and are generally boring) and avoid innovative disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What I observe in the world is that, if you can accept that stuff exogenous to you is in a state of flux, you can focus on your own endogenous equanimity. And what I see out there is most people doing the opposite. They’re trying to control that exogenous flux. They’re trying to predict. They’re trying to be positioned for it. And that causes a state of inner turmoil. So I think part of it is almost a very simple behavioral switch. It’s saying, am I philosophically willing to accept flux, complexity, and uncertainty, or not? And if you say, yes, I am, then I think it’s extremely freeing in terms of your ability to focus on your own equanimity.” — McLennan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irving Kahn&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Investing is about preserving more than anything. That must be your first thought, not looking for large gains. If you achieve only reasonable returns and suffer minimal losses, you will become a wealthy man and will surpass any gambler friends you may have. This is also a good way to cure your sleeping problems.” — Kahn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Considering the downside is the single most important thing an investor must do. This task must be dealt with before any consideration can be made for gains. The problem is that people nowadays think they’re pretty smart because they can do something quite rapidly.” — Kahn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joel Greenblatt&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenblatt started on Wall Street with a summer job at Bear Stearns. He made riskless arbitrage trades via options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founded Gotham Capital with $7 million in assets. Averaged 50% per year over the first 10 years and averaged 40% annually over the first 20 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly 80% of the fund was in 6 to 8 positions. Many were spinoffs, restructures, companies emerging from bankruptcy, illiquid small caps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He purposely kept the fund small (all investor money was returned after 10 years).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He looked for hidden value that nobody wanted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing has a complexity problem. It avoids simplicity. Be it in the number of investment options to choose from, the strategies available, MPT’s formulas and ratios, or behavior, people gravitate toward the complex over the simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Why is it so valuable to reduce investing to a few core principles? For a start, it forces us to think through what we truly believe.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I have a simple way of looking at things that makes sense to me and that I’m going to stick with through thick and thin. That’s it.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing (and life) should be a process of subtraction and simplification. Removing what’s unimportant and unnecessary to focus on the key principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Noise: “The way I look at it is, if I own a chain store in the Midwest, am I all of a sudden going to sell it for half of what it’s worth because something bad happened in Greece? I don’t think so! But that’s what you read in the newspaper, and that’s what everyone is looking at. If you have a context to say, ‘Well, does it matter or doesn’t it matter?’—it’s just very helpful.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“People are crazy and emotional. They buy and sell things in an emotional way, not in a logical way, and that’s the only reason why we have any opportunity.… So if you have a way to value businesses that’s disciplined and makes sense, you should be able to take advantage of other people’s emotions.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Valuation Techniques:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discounted Cash Flow: take the present value of estimated future earnings and compare to the company’s market cap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relative Value: compare a company’s valuation to similar businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquisition Value: an estimate of what another company might pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidation Value: estimated worth if company is closed, assets are sold, debts are paid, and what’s left is distributed to shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I like calculating the odds. Consciously or unconsciously, I’m calculating the odds on every investment. What’s the upside? What’s the downside?… I don’t think you can be a good investor without thinking in that way.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s easier to find bargains off the beaten path or in extraordinary situations that other people aren’t looking at.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You size your positions based on how much risk you’re taking. I don’t buy more of the ones -   I can make the most money on. I buy more of the ones that I can’t lose money on.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Pretty much everything we ever owned, we sold way too early. If you’re very cheap in buying, it’s hard to be as comfortable when something has doubled or tripled, even if it’s still good.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“One of the beauties of the pain that people have to take in underperformance is that, if it did not exist, everyone would do what we do.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best strategy is the one you can stick to in good and bad times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Danoff&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed Fidelity Contrafund since 1990.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His investment philosophy: “Stocks follow earnings.” — Danoff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He looks for companies that can grow earnings at a high rate over 5 years because stock price will follow it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Do you want to win the game for shareholders and own great companies? Sometimes, to own a great company, you’ve got to pay a fair price.” — Danoff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Will once said to me, falsely, ‘Look, I’m not that smart and there’s a lot of information out there. So when I look at a company, I just ask myself: ‘Are things getting better or are they getting worse?’ If they’re getting better, then I want to understand what’s going on.’ ” — Bill Miller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Miller&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The world changes. This is the biggest problem in markets.” — Miller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s all probabilities. There is no certainty.” — Miller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I’m trying to get rid of the unnecessary parts of what I used to do… I don’t build models anymore. It’s just stupid. It doesn’t make any sense… For every company, there are a few key investment variables and the rest of the stuff is noise.” — Miller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Sleep &amp;#x26; Qais Zakaria&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started Nomad Investment Partnership in 2001 and retired in 2014. They charged a tiny flat fee to cover expenses, then 20% of the funds profits over a 6% return hurdle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both worked at Marathon Asset Management prior to starting the firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They started in “cigar butts” but quickly graduated to a concentrated portfolio of high-quality companies held for years (average holding period was about 7 years).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No shorting, no leverage, no active trading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information has a “shelf life.” Most of it expires in a few days, weeks, or months. They looked for information with a long shelf life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They purposely detached themselves from day-to-day market action. Even placed their Bloomberg terminal in the most uncomfortable location, a short corner table without a chair, to limit its use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We just read annual reports until we were blue in the face and visited every company possible until we were sick of it.” — Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where will the company be in 10 or 20 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s management doing today to make that more likely to happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What might stop that from happening?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the company improving customer relations with “superior products, low prices, and efficient service?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does management make sound capital allocation decisions to improve shareholder value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the company mistreat employees, suppliers, customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the company do anything that could hurt its reputation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Benefits of Quality Management: “If they’re thinking rationally and thinking about the long term, you can subcontract the capital allocation decisions to them. You don’t have to be buying and selling shares.” — Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale Economies Shared Model:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies that take advantage of economies of scale to grow revenue while lowering the cost of business only to share those cost savings with customers to further entrench their advantage over competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Increased revenues begets scale savings begets lower costs begets lower prices begets increased revenues.” — Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costco is an example. It deferred profits for customer satisfaction/retention and long-term growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to be founder-led companies where the founder is obsessive about small details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to prioritize the customer experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to be serial cost-cutters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to be very long-term focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.com.” — Jeff Bezos, 2005 Shareholder Letter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s all about deferred gratification. When you look at all the mistakes you make in life, private and professional, it’s almost always because you reached for some short-term fix or some short-term high… And that’s the overwhelming habit of people in the stock market.” — Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Russo&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I call myself a farmer. Wall Street is flooded with hunters — people who try to go out and find the big game. They fell it and bring it back, and there’s a huge feast and everything is fabulous, and then they look for the next big game. I plant seeds and then I spend all of my time cultivating them.” — Russo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He looks for companies with the “capacity to suffer.” They are built to survive tough times and outlast the competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Less jam today for more jam tomorrow, the three little piggies, etc, are childhood tales that inculcate thoughtful people with the message of deferred gratification. Society has, however, created endless reasons why decision makers mistakenly prefer more jam today even at the expense of jam tomorrow. Much investment opportunity arises from being able to take the other side of the short-termism bet. I have been blessed with investors who permit me to take the longer view.” — Russo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff Gundlach&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If I assume that I’m wrong on this, what’s the consequence going to be?… Make your mistakes nonfatal. It’s so fundamental to longevity. And ultimately, that’s what success is in this business: longevity.” — Gundlach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Gayner&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gayner manages Markel’s investment portfolio since 1990.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His goal is to find tiny habits repeated daily that lead to long-term success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If you want the secret to great success, it’s just to make each day a little bit better than the day before. There are different ways you can go about doing that, but that’s the story… Just making progress over and over again is the critical part.” Gayner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It struck me that we should think small, not big, and adopt a philosophy of continuous improvement through the aggregation of marginal gains. Forget about perfection; focus on progression, and compound the improvements.” — Sir David Brailsford, coach of the British cycling team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns, training, learning, etc., it all compounds!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Principles:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He looks for profitable companies with good ROC and little leverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality management with integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company can reinvest profits at a good rate of return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be bought at reasonable price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He wants compounding machines to hold “forever.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s been my experience that the richest people were those who found something good and held on to it. The people who seemed the least happy and the most frenzied and the least successful are those that are always chasing the next hot thing.” — Gayner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His portfolio is over 100 stocks with 66% in the top 20 positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You cannot control the outcome. You can only control the effort and the dedication and the giving of one hundred percent of yourself to the task at hand. And then whatever happens, happens.” — Gayner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Lountzis&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You need a maniacal focus to really be great at anything. Anyone who tells you that you can have everything all at once, you can’t. I mean, you don’t become Roger Federer by not playing tennis. It has to be consuming.” — Lountzis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All great investors, CEOs, athletes, etc. are practically fanatical about it (at the expense of other areas of their life). Fanaticism won’t guarantee success but being fanatical makes it easier to compete in a world of fanatics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He hoards information on the best in the business and investing world to read and reread. The repetition makes the lessons unforgettable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You can’t mimic them because you’re not them. Learn it and adapt it and modify it into your own process.” — Lountzis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charlie Munger&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He constantly tries to avoid stupidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Other people are trying to be smart. All I’m trying to be is non-idiotic. I find that all you have to do to get ahead in life is to be non-idiotic and live a long time. It’s harder to be non-idiotic than most people think.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Attacking Problems via Inversion: “It’s counterintuitive that you go at the problem backward. If you try and be smart, it’s difficult. If you just go around and identify all of the disasters and say, ‘What caused that?’ and try to avoid it, it turns out to be a very simple way to find opportunities and avoid troubles.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to avoid stupidity is to ask: How bad will this be? Instead of, How great will this be? Or about investing more broadly ask: what are all the stupid ways people lose money? Then don’t do those things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Finding out what’s wrong and trying to avoid it is different from finding out what’s good and trying to get it. You have to do both, of course, in life. But this inversion of looking for the trouble and trying to avoid it keeps you out of a lot of messes… It’s a precaution. It’s like a checklist before you take off in an airplane.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“A lot of people are so interested in reaching for the prize that they don’t even think about the stupidities that might prevent them from getting it.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger collects examples of other people’s exceptionally stupid behavior. So can he learn from others’ mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common Errors:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening to market predictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying cyclicals at the top of the cycle or poor businesses at market tops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being close-minded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing things because “other people do it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rush to decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego, overconfidence, overoptimism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I know I’ll perform better if I rub my nose in my mistakes. This is a wonderful trick to learn.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Incentives: “If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason. This maxim is a wise guide to a great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Discovering Your Own Errors: “If Berkshire has made modest progress, a good deal of it is because Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don’t destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A systematic process of studying counterarguments, taking a devil’s advocate approach, or writing premortems (assuming disaster) are ways to limit biases and improve decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists of your biggest biases, emotional tendencies, and mistakes serve as a good checklist before making a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re going to be in this game for the long pull, which is the way to do it, you better be able to handle a fifty percent decline without fussing too much about it. And so my lesson to all of you is, conduct your life so that you can handle the fifty percent decline with aplomb and grace. Don’t try to avoid it. It will come. In fact, I would say if it doesn’t come, you’re not being aggressive enough.” — Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to be like a man standing with a spear next to a stream. Most of the time he’s doing nothing. When a fat juicy salmon swims by, the man spears it. Then he goes back to doing nothing. It may be six months before the next salmon goes by.” — Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joel Tillinghast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manages Fidelity’s Low-Priced Stock Fund since 1989, outperforming by roughly 4% per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He creates lists of things to avoid, “defensive principles and practices” that keep him focused and help outperformance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Don’t pay too much. Don’t go for businesses that are prone to obsolescence and destruction. Don’t invest with crooks and idiots. Don’t invest in things you don’t understand.” — Tillinghast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also avoids cyclicals, fads, heavy leverage, sales-y management, questionable accounting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He won’t talk publicly about his positions (makes it harder to change his mind).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If you want to be superior, that’s difficult. But what you won’t do is easier to control and more attainable… I’m not going to lose fifteen pounds. But saying no to doughnuts, that’s easy for me.” — Tillinghast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Thorp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“As far as gambling is concerned, if I don’t have an edge, I don’t play.” — Thorp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He heavily relied on the Kelly Criterion to size positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a chance to invest in LTCM but passed because they were “taking too much risk… So the probability of their ruin appeared substantial to me.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Lynch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You get a lot of A’s and B’s in school. In the stock market, you get a lot of F’s. And if you’re right six or seven times out of ten, you’re very good.” — Lynch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Learning to play poker or learning to play bridge, anything that teaches you to play the probabilities…would be better than all the books on the stock market.” — Lynch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templeton, Soros, and Buffett share “the willingness to be lonely, the willingness to take a position that others don’t think is too bright. They have an inner conviction that a lot of people do not have.”– Michael Lipper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A necessary characteristic of great investors is that they can’t be overly influenced by what other people think. The easiest way not to be overly influenced by what other people think is not to be that aware of what they think. If you don’t really notice that and don’t really care about what other people think, that will make it easier to be a great investor.” — Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Guerin tried to get rich faster than necessary. He was leveraged going into the 1973-74 crash, hit by margin calls, and forced to sell his shares in Berkshire Hathaway for less than they were worth (Buffett bought them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you’re even a slightly above average investor who spends less than you earn, over a lifetime you cannot help but get very wealthy.” — Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to swing at everything — you can wait for your pitch. The problem when you’re a money manager is that your fans keep yelling, ‘Swing, you bum!’” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We, and our judgment, and all mortal things go on flowing and rolling unceasingly. Thus nothing certain can be established about one thing by another, both the judging and the judged being in continual change.” — Michel De Montaigne&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook.” — William James&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, subtract things every day.” — Lao-tzu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uncertainty compels diversification. Diversification is and always has been the first tenet of the Prudent Man Rule of Investing… In sub-Saharan Africa, for centuries, people believed cattle were the safest repository of wealth. That was until the great drought came along.” — Barton Biggs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stock market is a sadistic, contrary, changeable beast and nothing is forever.” — Barton Biggs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The crucial question is whether the investor will, in fact, hold on. The problem is not in the market, but in ourselves, our perceptions, and our reactions to our perceptions. This is why it is so important for each client to develop a realistic knowledge of his own and/or his organization’s tolerance for market fluctuations…” — Charles Ellis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I call myself a farmer. Wall Street is flooded with hunters — people who try to go out and find the big game. They fell it and bring it back, and there’s a huge feast and everything is fabulous, and then they look for the next big game. I plant seeds and then I spend all of my time cultivating them.” — Russo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world changes. This is the biggest problem in markets.” — Miller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s all probabilities. There is no certainty.” — Miller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to get rid of the unnecessary parts of what I used to do… I don’t build models anymore. It’s just stupid. It doesn’t make any sense… For every company, there are a few key investment variables and the rest of the stuff is noise.” — Miller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you want to win the game for shareholders and own great companies? Sometimes, to own a great company, you’ve got to pay a fair price.” — Danoff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Will once said to me, falsely, ‘Look, I’m not that smart and there’s a lot of information out there. So when I look at a company, I just ask myself: ‘Are things getting better or are they getting worse?’ If they’re getting better, then I want to understand what’s going on.’ ” — Bill Miller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are crazy and emotional. They buy and sell things in an emotional way, not in a logical way, and that’s the only reason why we have any opportunity.… So if you have a way to value businesses that’s disciplined and makes sense, you should be able to take advantage of other people’s emotions.” — Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the market is precarious, you don’t have to know what the catalyst will be. You only have to know that there’s a vulnerability.” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Change is inevitable. The only constant is impermanence. We have to accommodate to the fact that the environment changes… We cannot expect to control our environment.” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only thing we can really count on in this uncertain world is human unreliability itself.” — Garrett Harden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people make the mistake of adding too much complexity to their lives. They skim the surface, preoccupying themselves with the superficial and the extraneous. As the best investors show, sustained excellence requires us to subtract and go deep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not borrow money to buy stocks.” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t act rationally when you’re investing borrowed money.” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I firmly believe that nobody knows what the market will do… The important thing is to find an attractive idea and invest in a company that’s cheap.” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I try to learn as much as I can about seven or eight good ideas. If you really find something very cheap, why not put fifteen percent of your money in it?” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know anybody who can really do a good job investing in a lot of stocks except Peter Lynch.” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people would be much better off with an index fund.” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m a shameless copycat… Everything in my life is cloned… I have no original ideas.” — Pabrai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are no prizes for frenetic activity. Rather, investing is mostly a matter of waiting for these rare moments when the odds of making money vastly outweigh the odds of losing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The number one skill in investing is patience — extreme patience.” — Pabrai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a person were going to own stocks and bonds, it would be much wiser to search everywhere, rather than limiting themselves to one nation.” — Templeton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to buy at a time when other people are desperately trying to sell.” — Templeton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a human failing to even put your mind on a question of which stock market is going to go up or down. There’s never been anybody who knew that.” — Templeton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m convinced that everything that’s important in investing is counterintuitive, and everything that’s obvious is wrong.” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He asks himself questions such as Are investors appropriately skeptical and risk-averse or are they ignoring risks and happily paying up? Are valuations reasonable relative to historical standards? Are deal structures fair to investors? Is there too much faith in the future?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always look at things in terms of ‘Where’s the mistake? Is the mistake in buying or not buying?’ — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both in markets and life, the goal isn’t to embrace risk or eschew it, but to bear it intelligently while never forgetting the possibility of an unpleasant outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our performance doesn’t come from what we buy or sell. It comes from what we hold. So the main activity is holding, not buying and selling. I’ve always wondered if it wouldn’t enhance an organization to say, ‘We only trade on Thursdays.’ And the other four days of the week, all you can do is sit and think.” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If your thinking is heavily colored by wishful thinking, then your probability assignments will be biased toward favorable… If you’re given to fear, then you’ll be biased toward the negative… No one is going to say, ‘This is my prediction and it’s probably wrong.’ But you must say, ‘This is my expectation and I have to be aware of the likelihood that it’s colored by my emotional bias.’ And you have to resist it. For me, that means not to chicken out when the going gets tough.” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To lag is to suffer. It becomes psychologically painful, but also financially painful… After one year, your shareholders are upset. After two years, they’re furious. After three years, they’re gone.” and “It had gone on for so long that there were days when I thought I was an idiot. You do, in truth, start doubting yourself… Everybody seems to see the light. How come I don’t see it?” — Eveillard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To the extent that we’ve been successful over the decades, it’s due mostly to what we did not own. We owned no Japanese stocks in the late eighties. We owned no tech in the late nineties. And we didn’t own any financial stocks to speak of between 2000 and 2008.” — Eveillard
Matthew McLennan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why is it so valuable to reduce investing to a few core principles? For a start, it forces us to think through what we truly believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have a simple way of looking at things that makes sense to me and that I’m going to stick with through thick and thin. That’s it.” — Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I like calculating the odds. Consciously or unconsciously, I’m calculating the odds on every investment. What’s the upside? What’s the downside?… I don’t think you can be a good investor without thinking in that way.” — Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s easier to find bargains off the beaten path or in extraordinary situations that other people aren’t looking at.” — Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want the secret to great success, it’s just to make each day a little bit better than the day before. There are different ways you can go about doing that, but that’s the story… Just making progress over and over again is the critical part.” Gayner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It struck me that we should think small, not big, and adopt a philosophy of continuous improvement through the aggregation of marginal gains. Forget about perfection; focus on progression, and compound the improvements.” — Sir David Brailsford, coach of the British cycling team&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwin Lefèvre’s fictionalized account of Jesse Livermore is a classic. It shares the timeless principles around trading in markets while warning of the biggest obstacle that plague speculators and investors alike — human nature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On bucket shop practices: “In the old days whenever a bucket shop found itself loaded with too many bulls on a certain stock it was a common practice to get some broker to wash down the price of that particular stock far enough to wipe out all the customers that were long of it. This seldom cost the bucket shop more than a couple of points on a few hundred shares, and they made thousands of dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What beat me was not having brains enough to stick to my own game—that is, to play the market only when I was satisfied that precedents favored my play. There is a time for all things, but I didn’t know it. And that is precisely what beats so many men in Wall Street who are very far from being in the main sucker class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is the plain fool, who does the wrong thing at all times everywhere, but there is the Wall Street fool, who thinks he must trade all the time. No man can always have adequate reasons for buying or selling stocks daily—or sufficient knowledge to make his play an intelligent play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions is responsible for many losses in Wall Street even among the professionals, who feel that they must take home some money every day, as though they were working for regular wages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A stock operator has to fight a lot of expensive enemies within himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know whether I make myself plain, but I never lose my temper over the stock market. I never argue with the tape. Getting sore at the market doesn’t get you anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It takes a man a long time to learn all the lessons of all his mistakes. They say there are two sides to everything. But there is only one side to the stock market; and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. It took me longer to get that general principle fixed firmly in my mind than it did most of the more technical phases of the game of stock speculation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have heard of people who amuse themselves conducting imaginary operations in the stock market to prove with imaginary dollars how right they are. Sometimes these ghost gamblers make millions. It is very easy to be a plunger that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All my life I have made mistakes, but in losing money I have gained experience and accumulated a lot of valuable don’ts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man must believe in himself and his judgment if he expects to make a living at this game. That is why I don’t believe in tips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is nothing like losing all you have in the world for teaching you what not to do. And when you know what not to do in order not to lose money, you begin to learn what to do in order to win.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The average ticker hound…goes wrong, I suspect, as much from overspecialization as from anything else. It means a highly expensive inelasticity. After all, the game of speculation isn’t all mathematics or set rules, however rigid the main laws may be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more I made the more I spent. This is the usual experience with most men. No, not necessarily with easy-money pickers, but with every human being who is not a slave of the hoarding instinct. Some men, like old Russell Sage, have the money-making and the money-hoarding instinct equally well developed, and of course they die disgustingly rich.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They say you never grow poor taking profits. No, you don’t. But neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tyro knows nothing, and everybody, including himself, knows it. But the next, or second, grade thinks he knows a great deal and makes others feel that way too. He is the experienced sucker, who has studied—not the market itself but a few remarks about the market made by a still higher grade of suckers. The second-grade sucker knows how to keep from losing his money in some of the ways that get the raw beginner. It is this semisucker rather than the 100 per cent article who is the real all-the-year-round support of the commission houses. He lasts about three and a half years on an average, as compared with a single season of from three to thirty weeks, which is the usual Wall Street life of a first offender. It is naturally the semisucker who is always quoting the famous trading aphorisms and the various rules of the game. He knows all the don’ts that ever fell from the oracular lips of the old stagers—excepting the principal one, which is: Don’t be a sucker!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In big bull markets the plain unadulterated sucker, utterly ignorant of rules and precedents, buys blindly because he hopes blindly. He makes most of the money—until one of the healthy reactions takes it away from him at one fell swoop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the big money was not in the individual fluctuations but in the main movements—that is, not in reading the tape but in sizing up the entire market and its trend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting… Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon. I found it one of the hardest things to learn. But it is only after a stock operator has firmly grasped this that he can make big money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man may see straight and clearly and yet become impatient or doubtful when the market takes its time about doing as he figured it must do. That is why so many men in Wall Street, who are not at all in the sucker class, not even in the third grade, nevertheless lose money. The market does not beat them. They beat themselves, because though they have brains they cannot sit tight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disregarding the big swing and trying to jump in and out was fatal to me. Nobody can catch all the fluctuations. In a bull market your game is to buy and hold until you believe that the bull market is near its end. To do this you must study general conditions and not tips or special factors affecting individual stocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most helpful things that anybody can learn is to give up trying to catch the last eighth—or the first. These two are the most expensive eighths in the world. They have cost stock traders, in the aggregate, enough millions of dollars to build a concrete highway across the continent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“..the average man doesn’t wish to be told that it is a bull or a bear market. What he desires is to be told specifically which particular stock to buy or sell. He wants to get something for nothing. He does not wish to work. He doesn’t even wish to have to think. It is too much bother to have to count the money that he picks up from the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Remember that stocks are never too high for you to begin buying or too low to begin selling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I am long of stocks it is because my reading of conditions has made me bullish. But you find many people, reputed to be intelligent, who are bullish because they have stocks. I do not allow my possessions—or my prepossessions either—to do any thinking for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To be angry at the market because it unexpectedly or even illogically goes against you is like getting mad at your lungs because you have pneumonia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…if a man is both wise and lucky, he will not make the same mistake twice. But he will make any one of the ten thousand brothers or cousins of the original. The Mistake family is so large that there is always one of them around when you want to see what you can do in the fool-play line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Losing money is the least of my troubles. A loss never bothers me after I take it. I forget it overnight. But being wrong—not taking the loss—that is what does the damage to the pocketbook and to the soul.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does not take a reasonably young and normal man very long to lose the habit of being poor. It requires a little longer to forget that he used to be rich. I suppose that is because money creates needs or encourages their multiplication. I mean that after a man makes money in the stock market he very quickly loses the habit of not spending. But after he loses his money it takes him a long time to lose the habit of spending.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The one game of all games that really requires study before making a play is the one he goes into without his usual highly intelligent preliminary and precautionary doubts. He will risk half his fortune in the stock market with less reflection than he devotes to the selection of a medium-priced automobile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a bull market bear factors are ignored. That is human nature, and yet human beings profess astonishment at it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a narrow market, when prices are not getting anywhere to speak of but move within a narrow range, there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be—up or down. The thing to do is to watch the market, read the tape to determine the limits of the get-nowhere prices, and make up your mind that you will not take an interest until the price breaks through the limit in either direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I sometimes think that speculation must be an unnatural sort of business, because I find that the average speculator has arrayed against him his own nature. The weaknesses that all men are prone to are fatal to success in speculation…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The speculator’s chief enemies are always boring from within. It is inseparable from human nature to hope and to fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man may beat a stock or a group at a certain time, but no man living can beat the stock market!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man can’t spend years at one thing and not acquire a habitual attitude towards it quite unlike that of the average beginner. The difference distinguishes the professional from the amateur. It is the way a man looks at things that makes or loses money for him in the speculative markets. The public has the dilettante’s point of view toward his own effort. The ego obtrudes itself unduly and the thinking therefore is not deep or exhaustive. The professional concerns himself with doing the right thing rather than with making money, knowing that the profit takes care of itself if the other things are attended to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man cannot be convinced against his own convictions, but he can be talked into a state of uncertainty and indecision, which is even worse, for that means that he cannot trade with confidence and comfort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of all speculative blunders there are few greater than trying to average a losing game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always sell what shows you a loss and keep what shows you a profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It cost me millions to learn that another dangerous enemy to a trader is his susceptibility to the urgings of a magnetic personality when plausibly expressed by a brilliant mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There isn’t a man in Wall Street who has not lost money trying to make the market pay for an automobile or a bracelet or a motorboat or a painting… In fact, of all hoodoos in Wall Street I think the resolve to induce the stock market to act as a fairy godmother is the busiest and most persistent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A great many smashes by brilliant men can be traced directly to the swelled head—an expensive disease everywhere to everybody, but particularly in Wall Street to a speculator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I learned that the weaknesses to which a speculator is prone are almost numberless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A trader, in addition to studying basic conditions, remembering market precedents and keeping in mind the psychology of the outside public as well as the limitations of his brokers, must also know himself and provide against his own weaknesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nowhere does history indulge in repetitions so often or so uniformly as in Wall Street. When you read contemporary accounts of booms or panics the one thing that strikes you most forcibly is how little either stock speculation or stock speculators to-day differ from yesterday. The game does not change and neither does human nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a bull market the trend of prices, of course, is decidedly and definitely upward. Therefore whenever a stock goes against the general trend you are justified in assuming that there is something wrong with that particular stock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Never try to sell at the top. It isn’t wise. Sell after a reaction if there is no rally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Among the hazards of speculation the happening of the unexpected—I might even say of the unexpectable—ranks high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I try to stick to facts and facts only, and govern my actions accordingly. That is Bernard M. Baruch’s recipe for success in wealth-winning. Sometimes I do not see the facts—all the facts—clearly enough or early enough; or else I do not reason logically. Whenever any of these things happen I lose. I am wrong. And it always costs me money to be wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The people who know what a stock is worth will always buy it when it is selling at bargain prices… But selling a stock down to a price much below what it is worth is mighty dangerous business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has always seemed to me the height of damfoolishness to trade on tips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The belief in miracles that all men cherish is born of immoderate indulgence in hope. There are people who go on hope sprees periodically and we all know the chronic hope drunkard that is held up before us as an exemplary optimist. Tip-takers are all they really are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Observation, experience, memory and mathematics—these are what the successful trader must depend on… He cannot bet on the unreasonable or on the unexpected, however strong his personal convictions may be about man’s unreasonableness or however certain he may feel that the unexpected happens very frequently. He must bet always on probabilities—that is, try to anticipate them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Experiences had taught me to beware of buying a stock that refuses to follow the group-leader.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am profoundly interested in all phases of my business, and of course I learn from the experience of others as well as from my own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…there is profit in studying the human factors—the ease with which human beings believe what it pleases them to believe; and how they allow themselves—indeed, urge themselves—to be influenced by their cupidity or by the dollar-cost of the average man’s carelessness. Fear and hope remain the same; therefore the study of the psychology of speculators is as valuable as it ever was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The principles of successful stock speculation are based on the supposition that people will continue in the future to make the mistakes that they have made in the past.” — Thomas F. Woodlock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sucker has always tried to get something for nothing, and the appeal in all booms is always frankly to the gambling instinct aroused by cupidity and spurred by a pervasive prosperity. People who look for easy money invariably pay for the privilege of proving conclusively that it cannot be found on this sordid earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the stock market, as in warfare, it is well to keep in mind the difference between strategy and tactics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Experienced speculators do not expect ever to engage in utterly riskless ventures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After a boom the public is positive that nothing is going up. It isn’t that buyers become more discriminating, but that the blind buying is over. It is the state of mind that has changed. Prices don’t even have to go down to make people pessimistic. It is enough if the market gets dull and stays dull for a time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In every boom companies are formed primarily if not exclusively to take advantage of the public’s appetite for all kinds of stocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The top is never in sight when the vision is vitiated by hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Stock Splits: “It is an old device in Wall Street—to change the colour of the certificates in order to make them more valuable. Say a stock ceases to be easily vendible at par. Well, sometimes by quadrupling the stock you may make the new shares sell at 30 or 35. This is equivalent to 120 or 140 for the old stock—a figure it never could have reached.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting angry doesn’t get a man anywhere. More than once it has been borne in on me that a speculator who loses his temper is a goner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The speculator’s deadly enemies are: Ignorance, greed, fear and hope. All the statute books in the world and all the rules of all the Exchanges on earth cannot eliminate these from the human animal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In addition to trying to determine how to make money one must also try to keep from losing money. It is almost as important to know what not to do as to know what should be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When a stock keeps on going down you can bet there is something wrong with it, either with the market for it or with the company. If the decline were unjustified the stock would soon sell below its real value and that would bring in buying that would check the decline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a bull market and particularly in booms the public at first makes money which it later loses simply by overstaying the bull market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No matter how experienced a trader is the possibility of his making losing plays is always present because speculation cannot be made 100 percent safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;an owner-occupied investment property is a home that has been purchased as an investment but that also functions as a primary residence for the investor. Because America loves homeowners, investing in real estate that doubles as a home satisfies the country’s love of homeownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can consider a single-family home as an investment if you purchase it with the intention of using it as a real estate investment in the future or if you can build substantial equity by doing something like rehab and then parlay that equity into greater investments later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small multifamily properties, such as duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes, are eligible for the same American benefits as single-family homes. That is, they are low cost, easy to obtain financing for, and offer the potential to generate constant monthly income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FHA loan is a government backed loan that allows you to purchase property. However, it also has its share of problems, such as the Mortgage insurance premium that can really add up and the fact that you can have only 1 FHA loan at a time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;203k loan (renovation loan in canada) is a subset of the FHA program and allows the borrower to borrow money to pay for cosmetic repairs such as paint and carpet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the biggest difference between a regular 203k loan and a streamlined one is the extent of the rehab. The streamlined one can be used for smaller cosmetic problems, like painting, carpet, and smells, whereas the regular one can be used for structural changes, like moving walls or building additions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investing in real estate with partners to avoid large amount of money upfront&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your brand consists of yourself and your product.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your personal brand is built through 3 primary areas: reputation, knowledge, and experience. Use your gaps in knowledge as motivation to grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your BRRR approach requires you to develop a strong and consistent product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are 4 different ways you can partner
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equity partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;down payment equity partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;private lending partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before partnering with someone, you must speak with a CPA and a lawyer who specializes in this kind of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the main reason why partnerships fail is because of personality conflicts. In addition, differences in opinion and suspicion/trust issues can cause problems as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;home equity loan or line of credit can be used/borrowed to invest in real estate.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it generally has low interest rates, which is generally tied to the prime rate, but the interest rates are adjustable and high during inflation period, which is another risk to take into account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another risk you take is if you house’s value decreases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another strategy is to refinancing your load through the bank after the repairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another option is to get a business line of credit from a commercial bank or portfolio lender. This allows you to access the equity in your properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by using your home’s equity to fund your real estate purchase, you’re reducing the amount of cash flow you receive. Getting a good deal on the property is even more crucial to make up for this reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All investors are susceptible to behavioral mistakes that then leads to poor returns. Gray and Carlisle create a quantitative value strategy that exploits the typical investors’ flaws while building temperament into their model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“While the term quantitative likely conjures images of complex equations churned by powerful computers, it’s best understood as the antidote to behavioral error.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price and value are distinct but intrinsic value is less easy to define. It can only be estimated through some valuation model using past information to make future projections. Changing the projections changes the intrinsic value. In theory, investors can twist valuation models to their will by tweaking the inputs…and they often do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The behavioral argument for value: investors project recent poor earnings into the future, stock prices fall with the projections and overreaction to bad news, until selling drives stocks to be undervalued. Value investors best against the overreaction to bad news and assumed continued poor performance, by buying underpriced stocks that go on to beat the market. To most investors, value stocks appear to be riskier than they really are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Graham’s Simple Quant Strategy:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What’s needed is, first, a definite rule for purchasing which indicates a priori that you’re acquiring stocks for less than they’re worth. Second, you have to operate with a large enough number of stocks to make the approach effective. And finally, you need a very definite guide for selling.” — Ben Graham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio with a minimum of 30 stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E &amp;#x3C; 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt-to-Equity &amp;#x3C; 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell each stock after a 50% return or after 2 years, whichever comes sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham estimated a 15% annual return (backtested from 1976 to 2011 exceeded Graham’s estimates by about 2%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But why? Because the strategy was followed — absent fear and greed, during years of underperformance — consistently to the letter. Temperament is built into the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Systematic behavioral biases create opportunities for investors who can find a way to control their innate weaknesses.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studies show that experts underperform or can do no better than simple models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All investors are biased in some way. Rather than trying to correct the flaws, why not build a strategy that protects from the flaws. The same strategy can also be built to exploit the flaws of others, providing the necessary edge to outperform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Even once we are aware of our biases, we must recognize that knowledge does not equal behavior. The solution lies in designing and adopting an investment process that is at least partially robust to behavioral decision-making errors.” — James Montier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross Profitability (GPA)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A proxy measure for Quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPA = (Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold)/Total Assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The farther down the income statement one goes, the more polluted profitability measures become, and the less related they are to true economic profitability. For example, a firm that has both lower production costs and higher sales than its competitors is unambiguously more profitable. Even so, it can easily have lower earnings than its competitors. If the firm is quickly increasing its sales through aggressive advertising, or commissions to its sales force, these actions can, even if optimal, reduce its bottom line income below that of its less profitable competitors. Similarly, if the firm spends on research and development to further increase its production advantage, or invests in organizational capital that will help it maintain its competitive advantage, these actions result in lower current earnings. Moreover, capital expenditures that directly increase the scale of the firm’s operations further reduce its free cash flows relative to its competitors. These facts suggest constructing the empirical proxy for productivity using gross profits.” — Robert Novy-Marx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of the book is a good example for thinking about how a quant value strategy might be structured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Permanent Loss of Capital&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove companies with the potential for earnings manipulation and fraud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first place to look is accruals used to manipulate earnings to look better than reality. The goal is to avoid stocks showing the illusion of quality earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Interestingly, simply measuring net income against cash flow captures many of the earnings manipulations, and, as it turns out, is predictive of future returns.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beneish M-Score looks at manipulation from the view of probability based on characteristics found in past financial manipulators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove companies with a high chance of distress or bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altman Z-Score uses a combination of five ratios to determine a likelihood of bankruptcy (a score below 1.81 = bankrupt, above 1.81 = not bankrupt).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Z-Score was built for manufacturing companies, showing a need for a model that adjusts for industry accounting conventions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“…stocks with higher leverage, lower profitability, lower market capitalization, lower past stock returns, more volatile past stock returns, lower cash holdings, lower price-to-book ratios, and lower prices per share are more likely to file for bankruptcy, be delisted, or receive a “D” rating… Investors should be aware that stocks with a high risk of failure tend to deliver particularly poor returns, and at heightened risk.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Cheap Quality&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett’s “wonderful business” presents a high return on capital in excess of market rates of return and over an extended time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross Profitability  or GPA = (Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold)/Total Assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on Capital or ROC = EBIT/Capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two above measures of quality don’t account for price. That introduces a problem — mean reversion. 1) It confused stocks at the peak of a business cycle with franchises. 2) Businesses with high returns on capital draw competition. In both cases, high returns erode and mean revert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One way to filter out franchises from companies at peak business cycle is to look at metrics averaged over the long term — long enough to account for a full business cycle. Franchises should show more consistent stable returns over the full cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“A consistently high, stable profit margin indicates the presence of a franchise.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piotroski F-Score looks for cheap but financially strong companies — looking at 1) profitability, 2) leverage, liquidity, and funding source, and 3) operating efficiency — where higher F-score = higher financial strength. Piotroski found that eliminating financially weak companies improved overall returns (the weakest, underperformed the market). The F-Score tends to produce more small and mid-cap stocks than large caps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Cheap Price&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several ratios can be used as a proxy for value: E/P, EBIT/EV, EBITDA/EV, FCF/EV, Gross Profits/EV, B/M were backtested in the book. EBIT/EV, EBITDA/EV, and GP/EV were the most robust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cheapest decile of each outperformed the market. The most expensive decile of each performed the worst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normalizing the “earnings” in the ratios over multiple years, versus the single year, didn’t produce better results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A composite of all the ratios is another idea, reducing the chance of any single ratio lagging over a longer period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Supporting Signals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buyback Yield = companies that reduced outstanding shares the most in a year, outperformed the market. Companies issuing the most shares in a year underperformed the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insider Transactions = there’s only one reason insiders buy, but many reasons insiders sell. But its more nuanced than that. “Opportunistic” (i.e. irregular compared to “routine” trades) insider buying generated market-beating returns for the insider. Other things to look for are larger purchases on an absolute basis, or multiple irregular purchases over several months, or purchases while the company is buying back stock, or purchases in “value” stocks. Each could be a sign of higher conviction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activists = stocks targeted by activist investors tend to beat the market, after the initial Schedule 13D notice. The outperformance may last into the second year, possibly because management agrees to the activist’s recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloning is another option where you basically, ride the coattails of other successful investors by following them through 13F filing. But, you have to be able to find skilled investors who will continue to beat the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short Interest = a basket of lightly shorted stocks outperformed the market, highly shorted stocks fell short of the market. Avoiding highly shorted stocks, in a long-only portfolio, is another filter to consider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the K.I.S.S. method (Keep It Simple, Stupid) when building a strategy. More information is likely to increase confidence more than accuracy. The end result is overconfidence not better performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“As investors, we should favor simplicity over complexity, but as humans, we seem behaviorally destined to prefer complexity.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Did you like what the model said or did you not like what the model said? That is a hard thing to backtest. If you are going to trade using models, you just slavishly use the models; you do whatever the hell it says no matter how smart or dumb you think it might be at that moment.” — Jim Simons&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even once we are aware of our biases, we must recognize that knowledge does not equal behavior. The solution lies in designing and adopting an investment process that is at least partially robust to behavioral decision-making errors.” — James Montier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The farther down the income statement one goes, the more polluted profitability measures become, and the less related they are to true economic profitability. For example, a firm that has both lower production costs and higher sales than its competitors is unambiguously more profitable. Even so, it can easily have lower earnings than its competitors. If the firm is quickly increasing its sales through aggressive advertising, or commissions to its sales force, these actions can, even if optimal, reduce its bottom line income below that of its less profitable competitors. Similarly, if the firm spends on research and development to further increase its production advantage, or invests in organizational capital that will help it maintain its competitive advantage, these actions result in lower current earnings. Moreover, capital expenditures that directly increase the scale of the firm’s operations further reduce its free cash flows relative to its competitors. These facts suggest constructing the empirical proxy for productivity using gross profits.” — Robert Novy-Marx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Money Game is a series of stories on the games people play with money and markets. Told by Adam Smith (aka George Goodman), the stories uncover the emotion, error, myth, and irrationality that surrounds it all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynes was one of the first to describe the markets as a game, one that is “intolerably boring and over-exacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct; while he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game can be defined several ways: 1) something done as sport or fun; a diversion of sorts to keep things interesting, or 2) something more along the lines game theory, through math and weighing probabilities to decide on the most likely outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market — investing — is the greatest game of all. Because investing is “an exercise in mass psychology, in trying to guess better than the crowd how the crowd will behave.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the game is to make money, but for some, the goal is only about playing the game. (Of course, in order to play the game, you have to play in a way so that you always stay in the game.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask a dozen people the value of a stock and you’ll get a dozen answers. It’s best to view stock valuation as a range, instead of a fixed price. The factors that give a stock a value and price come partially from the financial statement, and mostly from the mood of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mood is what makes a system, a theory, a strategy, or a rational view on markets imperfect, imprecise, sometimes wrong, and irrational. Mood makes markets biological, complex, and in a constant state of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to know yourself. You have to be observant and honest and learn from mistakes. The decisions made around investing paint a portrait of who we are — biases and all. It’s better to figure it out, learn from it, and use it to our advantage, then to ignore it, fight against it, and fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Rule #1&lt;/strong&gt;: “If you don’t know who you are, this is an expensive place to find out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional maturity, remaining calm, keeping your cool, discipline, and patience are all used to describe a way of being in highly emotional, stressful, or anxiety filled situations. In other words, the markets. Succumbing to the stress and anxiety is why investing is so costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The crowd always loses because the crowd is always wrong. It is wrong because it behaves normally.” — Fred Kelly, Why You Win or Lose: The Psychology of Speculation, 1930&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone believes themselves to be a contrarian when really their part of the crowd. Also, human nature suggests most people find comfort being part of the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every bubble or euphoric period — from tulips to South Seas shares to Nifty Fifty to Dotcom stocks — must start with a rational idea. As the story spreads, the crowd mentality takes over, till it eventually peaks. Then every dip lower becomes a false buying opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Crowds are somewhat like the sphinx of ancient fable: it is necessary to arrive at a solution of the problems offered by their psychology or to resign ourselves to being devoured by them.” — Gustave Le Bon, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, 1896&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do they play the game? For many different reasons: the action, the image it presents, the sense of belonging (being in a crowd), being on the “inside”, the stories to brag to friends and strangers, basically, so they can say they play the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And few people actually play for the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the participants play the game differently. They make up their own set of rules and have a different definition of winning. And they often change the rules and the definition multiple times depending on how well they’re playing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greed and fear are the strongest emotions in the market. Nobody likes to watch others make more than them. And we hate losing more than like winning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those two emotions (along with others) have a huge impact on an investors willingness to change goals and time horizons. Hesitant, cautious, and timid at the bottom. Bold, confident, and audacious at the top. The exact opposite of what’s necessary for success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Rule #2: “The identity of the investor and that of the investing action must be coldly separate.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any sense of attachment or emotion to an investment can lead to a humbling experience for the most brilliant investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The most important thing to realize is simplistic: The stock doesn’t know you own it .” Nor does it care. Investing is the epitome of a one-sided relationship. Emotional connections don’t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detachment means you can change your mind or reverse course, without being tied down by prior decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of goals identified by numbers because it’s easy to fixate on a big round number and sometimes the goals — goalposts — often get moved by jealousy or envy or greed…or dreams. How many investors, despite big gains, hold on for “just a little more” and never got there. In the book, that’s the story of Harry, who could be anybody. He fixated on $1,000,000 because that was a life-changing number. He came close so many times, and took big risks (margin) to get there, but failed because anything less wasn’t enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trouble with high growth companies: they carry the seeds of their destruction. Unless the company has some advantage, the high growth attracts copycats. Growth is spread across competitors, prices get cut as they battle for market share, and profit margins suffer. And when that doesn’t work, there’s a point where growth falters because growth is finite. Companies grow too big to grow at a high rate and there’s no magic number that says when they hit too big. And then there’s the market. There’s no way to know the multiple the market would put on the growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adam Smith’s bias — Concentration: “Sweet are the uses of diversity, but only if you want to end up in the middle of an average. By concentrate I mean in a few issues only. There are, at any one moment, only a few stocks that have a maximum potential, and I, for one, am not smart enough to be able to follow more than a handful of stocks at a time… If you are concentrated in only a few stocks, you are forced to measure each of them in terms of potential against each new idea that comes along, and this in turn makes you bump the bottom stocks off — the worst-performing ones — to take aboard something more promising.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Rule #3: “Find smart people.”&lt;/strong&gt; Phil Fisher, the creator of the scuttlebutt approach, looked at his past successes to find that only one-sixth of them were found through scuttlebutt. The five-sixth, the rest, were from a network of smart people he knew and trusted. The downside: groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people choose to play the game as described by Keynes’s beauty contest: “We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.” So all kinds of systems have sprung up to figure out what is everybody else doing? Really, they’re finding out, what has everybody else done but never solving, what will everybody else do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why what is everybody else doing? Because it’s comfortable. If you’re doing what you believe everyone else is doing, you’re making money when they make money, losing when they’re losing, and risking about the same as everyone else. Doing the opposite of everybody else is often an uncomfortable place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If those systems, actually worked — could always predict what everybody else was doing — everyone would use it, and it would stop working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, if enough people follow a system, it becomes a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy…for a while. So if the system buys what goes up, then what is going up will continue to go up. — “Once it is accepted that the patterns can represent motion, it follows that a Trend is a Trend is a Trend until it stops being a Trend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotion is the last bastion that no one has figured out how to measure: “No one has yet learned how to put emotions into serial correlation coefficients and analyses of runs. It is absolutely true that statistically the price of a stock has no relation tomorrow to what it was yesterday. But people — the Crowd — do have a memory that extends from day to day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overreliance on mathematics imbues an expectation of precision in markets that are rarely precise. The more complex the math, the more speculative the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting standards and financial statements imply precision too, yet earnings can be manipulated up or down any number of ways. Example: there is no uniformity between companies on depreciation charges, amortization, inventory valuation, or goodwill. The implication: using complex math and “manipulated” financial statements to unearth things like precise earnings or growth trends is impossible. Investing is more art than science, so treat it as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is almost every investor, broker, analyst takes the accounting numbers at face value and rarely spends/has the time to look past the image management wants to project to see what’s being manipulated, why, and what it really means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote above refers to the conglomerate craze of the ’60s — see ITT and TLV — that used acquisitions to show earnings growth and accounting trickery to hide the real losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has always been a They in markets, which Smith refers to as elephants, that move markets at a whim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Depression: “It is a sobering experience to read through—as once I did—all the Wall Street Journals and Barron’s from 1929 to 1933. Quarterly, reports came out saying, ‘the outlook is favorable,’ ‘a sustained recovery is on its way,’ and so on. But nobody was listening. Those on margin had been sold out in 1929 and 1930. But from 1930 to 1933, a real blight of the spirit took place.” From 1929 to 1933, the Dow fell almost 90%. The Depression described the economy and the mood at the time. Much like what Smith describes, the book Oh Yeah!, published in 1932, relays a lot of the forced optimism from CEOs and the government who repeated said a recovering was right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity, or lack thereof, is the biggest threat to short-term performance chasers. If everyone wants to get out, and no one is buying, losses pile up fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk to funds managers includes optics: how does it look to own big losers, how does it look to own winners, how does it look sitting on a big pile of cash while the market rises. It’s career risk. Not many are willing to bet their jobs by looking wrong or dumb in the short term, even if looking wrong produces great results in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end-of-the-worlders, doomsayers, and gold-bugs have existed in markets forever and their calls will never cease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is how the game is scored…a path to being rich. The conundrum lies in how you define rich. You can treat it as a possession to see who can collect the most or you treat it as a means to an end, the means being financial freedom and enjoyment of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The market does not follow logic, it follows some mysterious tides of mass psychology.”
The mass psychology has a way of taking hold of every new generation of investors because they’re too young to remember to any bad times and they’re undefeated in the current market. So they fall in love with “the New Math, the New Economics, and the New Market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most brilliant and perceptive analysis you can do may sit there until someone else believes it too, for the object of the game is not to own some stock, like a faithful dog, which you have chosen, but to get to the piece of paper ahead of the crowd. Value is not only inherent in the stock; to do you any good, it has to be value that is appreciated by others… If you are in the right thing at the wrong time, you may be right but have a long wait; at least you are better off than coming late to the party. You don’t want to be on the dance floor when the music stops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Markets are only a tiny facet of society, but being made by mass psychology, they are a good litmus paper for what is going on. Markets only work when they believe, and this confidence is based on the idea that men can manage their affairs rationally. The longest period of prosperity in the last few hundred years came when everyone believed that the king was on the throne, that the pound was worth a pound, that God was in His Heaven, and that all these things would continue for ever and ever… In the longer run, the actions of all the investors, individual and institutional, professional and nonprofessional, have to be based on the belief that leadership knows what it is doing and that rational men are handling the nation’s business rationally. If that belief fades, then so do the markets. They do not merely dive, they dive and then they disappear. It happened here in the blight of the spirit from 1930 to 1933, and it has happened in other countries.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the profit numbers on income statements are treated with such reverence, it was obviously only a question of time before some smart fellows would start building companies not around the logical progression of a business but around what would beef up the numbers. Such a corporation is called a “conglomerate” or a “free-form” company, very popular when the market gets to tulip-time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile — not that it means anything — there are few rich random walkers, and few rich Chartists. But there are some quite successful investors around who have no particular system. Perhaps they are the lucky holders of serial runs, perhaps they are more rational or have better access to information, and perhaps — something not taken into account in the austere statistical worlds — they are better students of psychology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Past patterns help determine future patterns; momentum can be shown on the charts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When there is no skepticism, there is almost no one left to sell to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No matter what role the investor has started with, in a climax on one side or the other the role melts into the crowd role of greed or fear. The only real protection against all the vagaries of identity-playing, and against the final role of being part of the crowd when it stampedes, is to have an identity so firm it is not influenced by all the brouhaha in the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the end object of investment is serenity, and serenity can only be achieved by the avoidance of anxiety, and to avoid anxiety you have to know who you are and what you’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has taken me years to unlearn everything I was taught, and I probably haven’t succeeded yet. I cite this only because most of what has been written about the market tells you the way it ought to be, and the successful investors I know do not hold to the way it ought to be, they simply go with what is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the real test is how you behave when the crowd is roaring the other way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing works all the time and in all kinds of markets… If you really love playing the Game, any action is better than inaction, and sometimes inaction is the proper course, if it has been taken after measuring all the measurable options. If a decision is made not to make a decision, that is just as much a decision as a decision which initiates action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will and Ariel Durant wrote the Lessons of History as a survey of human experience throughout history and the role human nature played in evolving and shaping civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Warning: “Our knowledge of any past event is always incomplete, probably inaccurate, beclouded by ambivalent evidence and biased historians, and perhaps distorted by our own patriotic or religious partisanship. ‘Most history is guessing, and the rest is prejudice.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historians oversimplify, selecting a few facts to tell the story of a chaotic, complex past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acceleration of change combined with chance affects how we apply order to a chaotic past. - The past is fluid because of how we view it through new inventions, discoveries, and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History is an art, not a science. It requires an ability to pull out facts that create meaningful order out of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must operate with partial knowledge, and be provisionally content with probabilities, in history, as in science and politics, relativity rules, and all formula should be suspect. ‘History smiles at all attempts to force its flow into theoretical patterns or logical grooves; it plays havoc with our generalizations, breaks all our rules; history is baroque.’ Perhaps, within these limits, we can learn enough from history to bear reality patiently, and to respect one another’s delusions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However incomplete, the past gives us a chance to understand today and prepare for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human history is a tiny blip on the historical timeline of Earth, the galaxy, and the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The influence of geographical factors diminishes as technology grows.” — Transportation, commerce, and trade (power) were originally controlled by those who controlled the seas. Trains disrupted it some, but the airplane disrupted the old trade routes and created new routes into areas unreachable by sea, shifting the balance of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The laws of biology are the fundamental lessons of history. We are subject to the processes and trials of evolution, to the struggle for existence, and the survival of the fittest to survive. If some of us seem to escape the strife or the trials it is because our group protects us; but that group itself must meet the tests of survival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological Lessons of History:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life is Competition — All species are in competition for survival — peaceful when foods aplenty, warring when food is sparse. They work in groups to improve competitive advantages. “We are acquisitive, greedy, and pugnacious because our blood remembers millenniums through which our forebears had to chase and fight and kill in order to survive, and had to eat to their gastric capacity for fear they should not soon capture another feast. War is a nation’s way of eating.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life is Selection — In the struggle for survival, some are better equipped to succeed, while other’s fail. Nature produces anomalies, specialization, and exceptionalism. Genetic inequalities lead to artificial inequalities. It gives advantage to some groups via invention and discovery, which disadvantages others. So the strong become stronger, and weak become weaker. In other words, inequality rules. — “Nature loves difference as the necessary material of selection and evolution.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life Must Breed — Nature prefers quantity over quality because quantity improves the odds of variation, competition, and selection. When populations are over-abundant, “nature has three agents to restore the balance: famine, pestilence, and war.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“History is color-blind, and can develop a civilization (in any favorable environment) under almost any skin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Nature: “Known history shows little alteration in the conduct of mankind. The Greeks of Plato’s time behaved very much like the French of modern centuries; and the Romans behaved like the English. Means and instrumentalities change; motives and ends remain the same: to act or rest, to acquire or give, to fight or retreat, to seek association or privacy, to mate or reject, to offer or resent parental care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human evolution over the past few thousand years has been social, not biological. People evolved economically, politically, intellectually, and morally through education, innovation, or imitation. Imitators (the majority) following innovators (the minority).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellect is the main driver of change but it can also drive destructive. So resistance to change plays an important role in questioning new ideas — to help weed out the good ideas from the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History reminds us that people have always been human…sin, mistakes, dishonesty, corruption, gambling has always existed. “We have noted the discovery of dice in the excavation near the site of Nineveh; men and women have gambled in every age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must remind ourselves again that history as usually written is quite different from history as usually lived: the historian records the exceptional because it is interesting — because it is exceptional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boring parts of history tend to get lost for being unexceptional but would offer a truer picture of how the overwhelming majority of people lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“History assures us that civilizations decay quite leisurely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early religion was not built on morals but the product of fear of mother nature and natural disasters. Fear was eventually redirected to promote morality and laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson of history is that religions have a life cycle — being born, thriving, and dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History is driven by underlying economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The men who can manage men manage men who can manage only things, and the men who can manage money manage all.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every economic system must have a way for people to gain wealth in exchange for productivity. - Economic systems that tried to use other motives (not wealth) to achieve productivity were too unproductive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Normally and generally men are judged by their ability to produce — except in war, when they are ranked according to their ability to destroy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since inequality rules, there always exists a small portion of the population with a better ability than most to gather wealth. This concentration of wealth is a recurring theme throughout history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The redistribution of wealth is also a recurring theme. The rate of wealth concentration depends on the morals and laws of the time. If the gap between rich and poor becomes too wide, revolution or new laws rebalance the wealth gap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We conclude that the concentration of wealth is natural and inevitable, and is periodically alleviated by violent or peaceable partial redistribution, In this view all economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of concentrating wealth and compulsive recirculation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socialism versus capitalism is part of the cycle of concentration and redistribution of wealth. Finding a balance between public and private has been a long struggle throughout history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitalism has shown its superior ability to put capital and people (talents) to work in the most productive and efficient way possible toward the production of goods and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socialism offers the possibility of equality to the most unequal through government-supported works like education, health, and recreation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competition, unhindered by laws and morals, drives capitalism to extremes. Private monopolies, price manipulation, wage manipulation, and other abuses eventually lead to riot and revolt demanding change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socialism, absent all liberty, leads to its own extremes. Government monopolies, price fixing, wage fixing, high taxation, and a police (military) force to maintain control, eventually lead to corruption, civil unrest, and revolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The fear of capitalism has compelled socialism to widen freedom, and the fear of socialism has compelled capitalism to increase equality.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History shows that power tends to centralize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolute freedom leads to chaos. So the role of government is to establish order without suffocating freedom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The history of governments is overwhelmingly one of monarchy, briefly interrupted by democracy. But monarchy has a poor poor track record thanks to hereditary succession. “When it is hereditary it is likely to be more prolific of stupidity, nepotism, irresponsibility, and extravagance than of nobility and statesmanship.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If the majority of abilities is contained in a minority of men, minority government is as inevitable as the concentration of wealth; the majority can do no more than periodically throw out one minority and set up another.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Violent revolutions do more to destroy wealth than redistribute it and ultimately recreating the very thing it sought to change. The natural tendency of inequality leads to a concentration of possessions, wealth, and power in a minority of hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The only real revolution is in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character, the only real emancipation is individual, and the only real revolutionists are philosophers and saints.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Every advance in the complexity of the economy puts an added premium upon superior ability, and intensifies the concentration of wealth, responsibility, and power.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democracy only succeeds with widespread intelligence. When intelligence is in the minority, democracy fails under widespread ignorance because ignorance is easily manipulated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It may be true as Lincoln supposed, that ‘you can’t fool all the people all the time,’ but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democracy has done more good than any other form of government because, despite prevailing inequality, its role is to provide access to education and opportunity as equally as possible — to give every person the best opportunity to succeed on their own merits and abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;War is a constant of history and the ultimate form of competition in humans. The reasons for war are the same for competition — a desire for more food, land, materials, fuels, power… Making long periods of peace as unnatural as equality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only constant in history is change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“History repeats itself, but only in outline and in the large…because human nature changes with geological leisureliness, and man is equipped to respond in stereotyped ways to frequently occurring situations and stimuli like hunger, danger, and sex. But in a developed and complex civilization individuals are more differentiated and unique than in a primitive society, and many situations contain novel circumstances requiring modifications of instinctive response; custom recedes, reasoning spreads; the results are less predictable. There is no certainty that the future will repeat the past. Every year is an adventure.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civilizations move between growth and decay. Growth depends on the right circumstances to produce highly intelligent, creative, able people equipped to successfully handle change. - Civilizations decline because it fails to produce people capable of handling change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is neutral. It will kill or create, destroy or build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite all the progress in science, technology, and knowledge, people are still the same biological creatures they were thousands of years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Consider education not as the painful accumulation of facts and dates and reigns, nor merely the necessary preparation of the individual to earn his keep in the world, but as the transmission of our mental, moral, technical, and aesthetic heritage as fully as possible to as many as possible, for the enlargement of man’s understanding, control, embellishment, and enjoyment of life.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“History assures us that civilizations decay quite leisurely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“History is color-blind, and can develop a civilization (in any favorable environment) under almost any skin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must operate with partial knowledge, and be provisionally content with probabilities, in history, as in science and politics, relativity rules, and all formula should be suspect. ‘History smiles at all attempts to force its flow into theoretical patterns or logical grooves; it plays havoc with our generalizations, breaks all our rules; history is baroque.’ Perhaps, within these limits, we can learn enough from history to bear reality patiently, and to respect one another’s delusions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The laws of biology are the fundamental lessons of history. We are subject to the processes and trials of evolution, to the struggle for existence, and the survival of the fittest to survive. If some of us seem to escape the strife or the trials it is because our group protects us; but that group itself must meet the tests of survival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must remind ourselves again that history as usually written is quite different from history as usually lived: the historian records the exceptional because it is interesting — because it is exceptional.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;B. H. Liddell Hart wrote the book as a summary of the history of warfare. Rather than writing the lessons we learn from history, he inverts the message to the many lessons we fail to learn from history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of history is in the countless repeated ways things can go wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History also teaches that the “tough times” are only temporary. There’s a light at the end of the darkest tunnels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History is only a broad guide — never offers precise details or blueprints — to dealing with current and future events in life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real lessons come from history’s negative value — in learning what to avoid — because it not only records the common mistakes many others made before us but how and why mistakes were made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“‘Fools,’ said Bismarck, ‘say they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by other people’s experience.‘”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning from personal experience should come second to learning from the experience of others since there are thousands of years to draw from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polybius: “There are two roads to the reformation for mankind — one through misfortunes of their own, the other through the misfortunes of others; the former is the most unmistakable, the latter the less painful…the knowledge gained from the study of true history is the best of all educations for practical life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we often mistake as a leader’s moment of brilliance in victory (on the battlefield) is really due to a long-ago development, innovation, or change in practice for the better that is finally executed in battle. Or, in case of the loser, a deterioration in practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s important not to discount the role of mood, morale, and emotional of the people plays in the cause of events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s human nature to paint people, including ourselves, in a better or worse light all time. History is filled with “leaders” willing to fudge their accounts of battle or write orders for false battles to save, maintain, or improve their reputations. They hide their faults. And if the leaders weren’t doing it, the possibility someone else — biased historians or subordinates looking to improve their position — did it for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“A sound rule of historical evidence is that while assertions should be treated with critical doubt, admissions are likely to be reliable. If there is one saying that embodies a general truth it is “No man is condemned save out of his own mouth.” By applying this test we can go a long way toward a clear verdict on history and on history in the making.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loyalty to the truth should be the ultimate goal of the historian and the reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History teaches that there has been a long-running battle with fear of the truth. People mistakenly fail to admit the truth, in so doing help to perpetuate recorded falsehoods. And if it’s not fear, then it’s distortion of the truth to promote a personal or political cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who seek the truth should approach “facts” with skepticism. “Is it true?” should be the first response of those who want to go through life with an open mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The most dangerous of all delusions are those that arise from the adulteration of history in the imagined interests of national and military morale. Although this lesson of experience has been the hardest earned, it remains the hardest to learn. Those who have suffered most show their eagerness to suffer more.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone makes mistakes, but wisest people know it, admit it, and accept it. The greatest failure is failing to recognize our proneness to mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much like the quote “democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others” is that democracy promotes the “triumph of mediocrity,” since its progress toward thought rarely moves faster than its slowest members. Yet, the alternative, despotism, might move faster around progress, typically leads to the “triumph of stupidity.” Weighing the two, mediocrity wins out. Those of us in a democracy, in wanting all its freedoms, must accept that it comes fully equipped with the inefficient pace of progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The psychology that power has on people’s minds has not changed throughout history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Associated with the psychology of power, is the ability to repeatedly ignore our capacity to fool ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of civilization is built on the simple idea of keeping promises, while also not making promises we can’t keep. The result is a lasting trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The cause of most troubles can be traced to excess; the failure to check them to deficiency; their prevention lies in moderation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the cause of most wars is placed on some economic, political, or religious factor, the deeper factors are always rooted in human nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History shows the end of every war sows the seeds of the next war because victories and peace settlements are rarely fair and balanced for both sides. And long and drawn out wars have no winners, only common losers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It is a recurrent illusion in history that the enemy of the time is essentially different, in the sense of being more evil, than any in the past. It is remarkable to see how not only the impression but the phrases repeat themselves. And even historians are apt to lose their balance when they turn from the past to the problems of their own time.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Looking back on the stages by which various fresh ideas gained acceptance, it can be seen that the process was eased when they could be presented not as something radically new but as the revival in modern terms of a time-honored principle or practice that had been forgotten. This required not deception but care to trace the connection — since “there is nothing new under the sun.&quot;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern warfare relies on depleting the will of the people more so than defeating the opposing army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History teaches that we have a long history of propping people up on pedestals out of respect or admiration but risk overinflating their abilities into legends. Over time, facts about the legendary people get overlooked, misplaced, or lost. We know that nobody is perfect, yet we continuously treat the legends as perfection. The older the legend, the older the text, the more we should look at the “facts” skeptically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, the older the text, the more we should treat the lessons within the writing as lessons of life and morality, as opposed to lessons of historical fact. It’s important to remember that the older the text is, the greater the likelihood that emotional bias and embellishment was introduced, first to the orally recorded history, then the written recorded history, and finally to the rewritten recorded history, by humans prone to mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science and technology have advanced more the past hundred years, than the prior millennium, in the improvement of life but when used in war, it’s used as irresponsibly and indifferently as it was in the prior millennium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The germs of war find a focus in the convenient belief that “the end justifies the means.” Each new generation repeats this argument—while succeeding generations have had reason to say that the end their predecessors thus pursued was never justified by the fulfillment conceived. If there is one lesson that should be clear from history it is that bad means deform the end, or deflect its course thither.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History teaches that we put more weight on the effect actions have on history than we do on the effect of thoughts. Yet, our capacity for thought and sharing of ideas is what drives all human progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What can the individual learn from history — as a guide to living? Not what to do but what to strive for. And what to avoid in striving. The importance and intrinsic value of behaving decently. The importance of seeing clearly—not least of seeing himself clearly.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What can the individual learn from history — as a guide to living? Not what to do but what to strive for. And what to avoid in striving. The importance and intrinsic value of behaving decently. The importance of seeing clearly—not least of seeing himself clearly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans handle uncertainty poorly. Richard Heuer explains how inherent biases in our thought process work against us, and that knowing about the biases is no help. Still, processes can be built to improve our critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is based on a collection of articles written by Heuer for the CIA to help analysts better understand how they process information involving uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Points (via Jack Davis in the Intro)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human mind is not wired to handle uncertainty well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing biases exist, even being warned about a bias, is little help in avoiding said biases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processes can be created that help offset these biases while working through complex problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans handle complexity terribly. So we developed shortcuts — simple rules of thumb or mental models — to help navigate complex information. The shortcuts work but are within limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortcuts — mental models, etc. — often determine how we interpret and organize information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our education, culture, experience, assumptions, preconceived ideas, etc., impact how we process and interpret information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major paradigm shifts mean that those that know the most about a subject — the experts — have the most to unlearn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Principles of Perception:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;”&lt;strong&gt;We tend to perceive what we expect to perceive&lt;/strong&gt;. A corollary of this principle is that it takes more information, and more unambiguous information, to recognize an unexpected phenomenon than an expected one.”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: A classic experiment showed how expectations influenced perception. Playing cards were altered so that some (not all) spades were red and hearts were black. Pictures of the cards were briefly flashed in front of test subjects. The subjects identified the unaltered cards quickly and accurately, but the unaltered cards gave them trouble. Even after becoming aware that some spades were red and hearts black, their recognition was still slower than with the normal cards. It shows how expectations (of black spades and red hearts) can be so deeply embedded that it influences perception, despite knowing the data was manipulated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, we’re so good at pattern recognition that we have a hard time recognizing when patterns have changed and have a hard time unlearning the patterns once we know it’s changed. Expectations trick our subconscious into seeing what should be there, not what is there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“People have no conceivable way of coping with the volume of stimuli that impinge upon their senses, or with the volume and complexity of the data they have to analyze, without some kind of simplifying preconceptions about what to expect, what is important, and what is related to what.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Mindsets tend to be quick to form but resistant to change.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once we have a pattern in our head, it’s hard to unlearn or replace it with new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“New information is assimilated to existing images.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow or gradual change often goes unnoticed. Experience can be a handicap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“One of the more difficult mental feats is to take a familiar body of data and reorganize it visually or mentally to perceive it from a different perspective.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once we’ve experienced something, like an event, in a particular way, we resist interpreting it differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Initial exposure to blurred or ambiguous stimuli interferes with accurate perception even after more and better information becomes available.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: People were shown pictures of everyday items. The pictures were initially shown out of focus but gradually brought into focus. Those who initially saw the images as the most out of focus had a harder time recognizing the items as the image became clearer than those who initially showed a less out-of-focus image. Longer exposure to a blurred image also required a clearer image to recognize the item. In other words, people form an expectation of what something might be, and confidence in their expectation grows with longer exposure, making changing our minds more difficult when faced with new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“People form impressions based on very little information, but once formed, they do not reject or change them unless they obtain rather solid evidence.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becomes a bigger problem when information is sparse or nonexistent and new information trickles in — form the wrong conclusion early based on sparse info, don’t change your mind as new info rolls in…until it’s too late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One solution is to withhold judgment as long as possible or as long as new information comes in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our accuracy takes the biggest hit when dealing with highly complex, ambiguous situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intelligence seeks to illuminate the unknown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our preconceptions make being objective practically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Ways to Learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By Rote: frequent repetition until it can be repeated from memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By Assimilation: teaching new information by tying it to previously learned information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By Mnemonic Device: a way of organizing information to make it easier to remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to deal with complex problems is to externalize them. Write it out. Break the problem into parts, then work through each while keeping sight of the whole problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our memory is affected by the order we learn something, the amount of time we spend on something, the credibility of the information, and the importance of it when we learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty means always dealing with incomplete knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Analysts Generate and Evaluate Hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situational Logic:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with facts about the current situation, then identify the consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deals with tracing cause-effect or means-ends relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness: 1) It is difficult to figure out how other people might think or behave because we assume they do like us. 2) Fails to consider historical knowledge — how things played out in similar past events — because it only focuses on the current situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situational logic is better for estimating short-term outcomes of events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying Theory:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A theory is formed from many past examples that lead to similar outcomes. It states that given certain conditions, certain results will follow based on a reasonable probability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A theory allows you to quickly separate signals from noise. It helps pick out the important points to a complex problem awash in massive amounts of information. It’s most handy in filtering out unimportant information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness: It often fails to identify time frames in the analysis. It may accidentally filter out important information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It compares the current situation to similar past events to understand possible outcomes. The past events help fill gaps where information is unavailable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often relies on historical analogies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike a theory, it’s used when the comparison sample size is small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A historical event might be so strong that it influences your view of the outcome from the start. Analysis of the current event will forecast a similar fate to the past event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It admits to a lack of current information to understand the present problem and a lack of historical precedent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can lead to misusing historical events by picking what you are most familiar with, by picking the first similar historical event you come across, by lacking historical knowledge, and not researching further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s like dealing with a situation that’s happened once or twice before, and the odds of a similar outcome are far from certain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison is best used to highlight differences, not similarities, in the current problem as it relates to a past event and not conclude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of data/information analysis is to be as objective as possible. It turns out that being objective is almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the scientific method — presenting a theory, then seeking to disprove it — leads to objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less Optimal Decision-Making Strategies (via Alexander George):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satisficing — Settle for the first “good enough” option rather than studying all the options to find the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incrementalism — Look at a narrow range of options that lead to marginal change rather than considering all the options, including those that lead to dramatic change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consensus — Pick the option that gets the most agreement from others or what they want to hear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasoning by Analogy — Pick the option that avoids a past error or repeats a past success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Principles or Maxims — Use a rule of thumb to separate a “good” option from a “bad” option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failures in Decision Making:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selective Perception: We tend to see what we want, not what we need to see. We overlook information that doesn’t fit what we’re looking for, however relevant it is. It’s best to focus on multiple theories at once rather than one when researching information. Not focusing on a single theory means you’re less likely to miss important information that fits other hypotheses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A big hurdle in theory generation is not coming up with a full range of potential outcomes. Most people take a lazy approach. They fail to put the time or effort into generating enough potential outcomes for a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diagnosticity: “Evidence is diagnostic when it influences an analyst’s judgment on the relative likelihood of the various hypotheses. If an item of evidence seems consistent with all the hypotheses, it may have no diagnostic value. It is a common experience to discover that most available evidence is not very helpful, as it can be reconciled with all the hypotheses.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disproving Hypotheses: The goal should be to disprove theories, especially our favourite, rather than confirm them. The problem is that seeking disconfirming evidence doesn’t come naturally. So when we find disconfirming evidence, we discount it, question its credibility, and/or write it off as an anomaly. When dealing with probabilistic outcomes, disproving outcomes is more beneficial than confirming outcomes because, often, relevant information confirms multiple outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is More Information Better?:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key #1: “Once an experienced analyst has the minimum information necessary to make an informed judgment, obtaining additional information generally does not improve the accuracy of his or her estimates. Additional information does, however, lead the analyst to become more confident in the judgment, to the point of overconfidence.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key #2: “Experienced analysts have an imperfect understanding of what information they use in making judgments. They are unaware of how their judgments are determined by a few dominant factors rather than the systematic integration of all available information. Analysts use much less of the available information than they think.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, more information does not improve accuracy. However, in some cases, it does, but also, in some cases, more information — especially contradictory info — decreases confidence in our analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Horse handicappers were shown 88 variables for a past performance chart of horses. The weight carried race finishes (1st, 2nd, 3rd), jockey’s record, and time since a horse’s last race. The handicappers had to identify the five most important variables if they were limited to just five per horse to handicap a race. Then they were asked to do the same thing for 10, 20, and 40 variables if limited to those amounts to handicap races. Each handicapper was given real data based on the five variables he chose and asked to predict each race. They were also asked to rate the confidence in their accuracy from 0 to 100. The same was done for the 10, 20, and 40 variables. The results showed that average accuracy did not change as the information increased, but the handicapper’s confidence in accuracy increased with more information. In other words, more information led to overconfidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Psychologists were given a case of a normal individual divided into four sections. They were asked to judge the case file and answer 25 questions about the person’s personality. The results show that more information did not improve accuracy in the questions but did increase confidence in their answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Doctors were asked how they made medical diagnoses. Doctors that prioritized being thorough with data were less accurate than doctors that approached diagnosis by identifying and testing hypotheses. Adding more data did not improve accuracy. Identifying, testing, and refuting hypotheses was more effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New information that confirms existing variables increases our confidence. In-depth information tends to be more persuasive to authors and readers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New information that introduces new variables is unlikely to improve accuracy in estimates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New information that changes variables critical to estimates has an impact, but it depends on the amount of new information and the confidence in the accuracy of the new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New information that shifts the importance of a variable affects confidence and estimates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More data backing up a conclusion leads to overconfidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to make better decisions requires constant feedback. Assess past decisions by linking accuracy in a decision with variables used to come to a decision. This works when the outcomes can be easily tied to specific variables, like in blackjack. This can be difficult to impossible in complex systems with hundreds or thousands of variables involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most analysis fails because we confuse signal for noise. Relevant information is discounted, misinterpreted, or ignored because of biases. Our biases limit how we view information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Stay Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitivity Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; — Question assumptions. Try to disprove them. Ask what would make your assumptions out of date. Has it already happened? What would make you change your mind? If you fail to come up with an answer, your mind isn’t open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify Alternatives&lt;/strong&gt; — Seek out people who disagree with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Mirror-Images&lt;/strong&gt; — Don’t assume that others will think or behave in the same way as you. Avoid the “If I were so and so, they would do X, Y, and Z.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek Out Different Perspectives&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking Backwards&lt;/strong&gt; — Start with the end in mind and work backward. Pick an alternative outcome and assume it happened. Then look back and explain how it happened. It changes the question from “what might happen” to “how it might happen.” Works great for low-probability, high-impact events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crystal Ball&lt;/strong&gt; — Assume you have a crystal ball that can predict the future, only it predicts that your assumption is wrong. Explain how the crystal ball is right. It forces you to try a disprove your assumption or poke holes in it, at least.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role-Playing&lt;/strong&gt; — Take on the role of another person and act out that person’s actions. It requires a group environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devil’s Advocate&lt;/strong&gt; — Bring someone to argue on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know When to Change Your Mind:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn from Surprises&lt;/strong&gt; — Keep track of unexpected events rather than discount or ignore it and try to explain them. A pattern of surprises might indicate that your thinking needs to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Assumptions vs. Tactical Indicators&lt;/strong&gt; — When indicators (like data points) disagree with assumptions, try giving more weight to indicators than the assumptions. Maybe don’t use said indicator to sway a decision but rather to stay more alert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boost Creative Thinking:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defer Judgment — The most important. Hold off judgment until all ideas are written down. Judgment sours creativity. Separate idea generation from the evaluation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantity Leads to Quality —  The first ideas are the most typical, obvious, and common ones. Coming up with as many ideas as possible inevitably produces a few quality ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Constraints — Make it as free-thinking as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross Fertilization — Combine ideas to form new ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are best done in groups — brainstorming sessions — within an organizational environment that supports the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decomposition — divides a problem into separate parts, i.e. divide and conquer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Externalization — gets the problem out of your head and onto paper. It’s most beneficial with complex problems because the many variables become too hard to track without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists, outlines, tables, diagrams, flow charts, and matrices work in a similar way to Franklin’s pro/con list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of Competing Hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify all the possible hypotheses. A group works best. Don’t overlook unproven hypotheses. Greater uncertainty in the outcome should lead to more hypotheses, not less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List the evidence/arguments for and against each one. Think about what evidence is missing too. Ask if a specific hypothesis is true and what evidence should exist. What evidence should not exist? What evidence should show up eventually?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a matrix — hypotheses across the top, evidence down the side — to see which evidence overlaps into multiple hypotheses compared to evidence that is unique and helpful to one hypothesis (diagnosticity). Ask if the evidence is consistent, inconsistent, or irrelevant. Add a probability scale to the evidence-based on its importance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refine the matrix by reconsidering hypotheses and deleting evidence with no unique value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw tentative conclusions and try to disprove the hypotheses. Accept only hypotheses that can not be rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the sensitivity of conclusions. Ask what the consequences are if the evidence is wrong or incorrect. Are there alternative explanations? Is fraud or deception a possible alternative?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report conclusions, including the probability of all the hypotheses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify future points to reassess events. Be specific about what to watch for or what would change your mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of competing hypotheses won’t guarantee correct answers. Uncertainty means there’s always a chance of being wrong. It’s about having a rational process that should increase the odds of being right. It also makes it easier to audit the process and make improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive biases&lt;/strong&gt; are subconscious mental errors caused by over-simplified rules of thumb that usually help us make quicker decisions. Under certain circumstances, those rules of thumb produce faulty decisions. Being aware of the bias won’t change the poor decision either. So biases are difficult to overcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information we experience directly&lt;/strong&gt; — we see, hear, etc. — has a greater impact than more informative information received secondhand. Things we experience personally are more memorable than the events we read about. Stories and anecdotes have a bigger impact than numbers. Statistical data lacks the vivid detail to elicit a memorable image, so it’s often overlooked. Even popular sayings back this up. “Seeing is believing.” or “Don’t believe everything you read.” It biases how we view information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Error&lt;/strong&gt;: The Sample Size of One — We let the experience of a single outcome outweigh the statistical probability of an outcome over larger sample size. One bad shopping experience, one bad meal at a restaurant, and one bad story about a particular car change our thinking about that store, restaurant, or car model. Testimonials from close family or friends or the “Man-Who” Syndrome (“I know a man who…”) work in a similar way. Despite the statistical evidence, a single outlier experience outweighs the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s difficult to recognize important missing or incomplete information and factor it into our analysis. The solution is to identify important variables in advance and use it to track missing information. The lack of specific information may support or refute certain outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oversensitive to Consistency&lt;/strong&gt; — a consistent pattern is usually helpful but could be deceptive in certain situations, like if the information is highly correlated to something else that’s not known yet or drawn from a small sample size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to accept or reject information completely without weighing our confidence in the accuracy of the information or its source. Rather than saying we’re 60% or 70% certain about a piece of information, we treat it as 100% certain or 0% certain, which can lead to over or under-confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False impressions persist after they’ve been discredited. For example, test subjects were misled about their success or failure at performing a task and continued to believe in their ability or lack of ability even after they were told the truth. A similar phenomenon was found in observers of experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Scientist Versus the Historian&lt;/strong&gt;: a scientist starts with a theory and sets out to disprove it with data, accepting it when it can’t be rejected. A historian creates a story out of a few pieces of data. A historian may overlook data to make the story coherent. That coherence can lead to biases. It implies order, patterns, or relationships that may not exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We often seek out causes for random events because we prefer order. For example, during WWII, people tried to explain the pattern of the German bombing of London. They used those explanations to decide where to live and which shelters to use. After the war, the bombings were shown to be randomly distributed. People focused on the bomb hits that fit their explanation and ignored the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We underestimate how small causes can lead to large effects. Accidents, unintended consequences, and coincidences get downplayed for more lofty or conspiratorial explanations. It’s another attempt to bring order to chance or randomness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fallacy of Identity&lt;/strong&gt; — we assume that the cause must resemble its effect. We use a rule of thumb that compares similar attributes between cause and effect to make judgments. We “tend to assume that economic events have primarily economic causes, that big events have important consequences, and that little event cannot affect the course of history. Such correspondence between cause and effect makes a more logical and persuasive–a more coherent–narrative, but there is little basis for expecting such inferences to correspond to historical fact.” It leads to conspiracy theories. We try to explain a big event with a similarly big cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal causes of behaviour are personality, attitude, and beliefs. External causes are incentives, peer or social pressure, and situation-specific role requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We put more weight on the internal causes of behaviour and less on external causes. It’s also dependent on whether it’s someone else’s behaviour or our own. External factors influence our behaviour, but others’ behaviour is internal. We tend to explain our behaviour as being influenced by specific situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We overestimate how much we influence the behaviour of others. We overlook unintended consequences and assume our actions had the desired effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also believe that our actions caused our successes but not failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also overestimate our importance in other people’s actions. Again, we overlook unintended consequences and assume that actions that hurt us were intended to hurt, not an unfortunate side effect of a decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illusory Correlation&lt;/strong&gt; — “Correlation alone does not necessarily imply causation. For example, two events might co-occur because they have a common cause rather than one causes the other. But when two events or changes co-occur, and the time sequence is such that one always follows the other, people often infer that the first caused the second. Thus, inaccurate perception of correlation leads to inaccurate perception of cause and effect.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to focus on things that support the existence of a relationship but ignore the things that don’t support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re bad at estimating and calculating probabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability Rule&lt;/strong&gt; — a rule of thumb used to estimate probability based on easily they can recall or how familiar they are with similar events. Generally, if something occurs often, it’s easier to remember and likely to continue occurring often. Unless our ability to remember or imagine something has nothing to do with its probability of happening. Problems arise because we tend to remember certain events better — recent events, events we were personally involved in, important events, etc. — and it affects our judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The act of constructing a detailed scenario for a possible future event makes that event more readily imaginable and, therefore, increases its perceived probability.” It can lead to taking unlikely scenarios too seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchoring&lt;/strong&gt; — when we use a starting point, like a past estimate, to make a new estimate, but rather than adjust the starting point based on new information, it acts as an anchor preventing adjustment. So estimates that start too low (too high) end up too low (too high).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awareness of an anchoring bias won’t fix the problem. The best way to avoid the problem is to not use any prior estimates as a starting point. Start from scratch. Using Bayesian statistics might be another option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We overuse subjective probabilities and underuse statistical probabilities. In other words, we rely on arbitrary words — possible, probable, likely, unlikely, could, etc. — that are subjective rather than actual numbers. Ask a bunch of people to put “probable” into percentage terms, and you’ll get a wide range of answers. Use percentages or odds in place or brackets after ambiguous words to avoid confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time frames like “at this time” or “in the short term” can be similarly too subjective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re bad at assessing the probability of a series of events — where each event has its probability — when estimating the outcome. The proper way is to multiply the probability of each event to get the final estimated probability. So the chance of getting three heads in a row while tossing a coin is .5 x .5  x .5 or .125 or 12.5%. Also, the event with the lowest probability sets the upper limit of the probability for the entire series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base Rate Fallacy&lt;/strong&gt; — base rates highlight the probability of a thing occurring based on a large sample size of data. The fallacy ignores the data unless it fits with data specific to the situation at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Planning Fallacy&lt;/strong&gt; — we overestimate our ability to finish a plan or project in a set amount of time despite experience suggesting otherwise. It’s a perfect example of the base rate fallacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hindsight Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we overestimate our accuracy, after the fact, in predicting an outcome before it happens. We also underestimate how much we learn from things we read, watch, etc. And when looking back at past outcomes, we view it as being obvious or foreseeable when, in fact, it wasn’t at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Test subjects were asked to estimate the probability of several events occurring during President Nixon’s trip to Peking and Moscow in 1972. Afterward, they were asked at varying periods to repeat their previous estimates of each event and whether the event occurred or not during the President’s trip. The hindsight bias was evident just three to six months after the trip. 84% claimed higher estimates than their original estimate for events that did occur and lower estimates for events that did not occur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We overestimate how much we previously expected an event to occur and underestimate how much we previously expected events that eventually did not occur. At some point after an event, knowing the outcome changes our memory of how much we previously expected said outcome. Our memory fades as time elapses, increasing the bias’s effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We underestimate the impact of new information. It’s the “I knew it all along…” bias.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Test subjects were asked 75 questions based on facts from almanacs and encyclopedias and assigned a confidence percentage to each answer. Afterward, the subjects were divided into three groups. The first group was given 25 previous questions and asked to repeat their prior answers. The second group was given the same 25 questions, with the correct answers circled, and asked to repeat their prior answers. The third group was given 25 new questions, just as difficult as the previous ones, with the correct answers marked and asked to give their answers as if they didn’t know the correct answer. The third group showed the most significant results. The number of correct answers far exceeded what they should have gotten correct had they not been given the correct answers in advance. They exaggerated knowing the answers and their confidence in knowing it. Said another way, they underestimated what they learned and how much it helped them answer correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to think that once an event happens that it is more easily foreseeable than it was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Test subjects were divided into five groups. Each group received a summary of an event — between the British and Gurkhas in 1814 — with four possible outcomes. One group received the summary with all four possible outcomes. The other four groups received the summary and the four possible outcomes but added a new sentence highlighting one outcome. So four groups, four sentences highlighting a different outcome. The groups were asked to estimate the probability of each outcome. The results showed that groups given a highlighted outcome gave a higher probability (almost double) of those outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One possible solution to hindsight bias is to ask: Would I be surprised if the opposite occurred? Would it be predictable if the opposite occurred?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define the Problem&lt;/strong&gt; — make sure you’re asking the right questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt; — as many as possible and hold off judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collect Information&lt;/strong&gt; — collect information related to all hypotheses, not just the most likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt; — disprove hypotheses rather than confirm them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select the Most Likely Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt; — cite arguments for and against it, including the odds of it happening and your confidence in the conclusion, and do the same for the rejected hypotheses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor for New Information&lt;/strong&gt; — Be specific about what to look for in advance. Watch for surprises. Situations change in a complex world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A fundamental question posed in any postmortem investigation of intelligence failure is this: Given the information that was available at the time, should analysts have been able to foresee what was going to happen? Unbiased evaluation of intelligence performance depends upon the ability to provide an unbiased answer to this question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowing the outcome of a situation makes it harder to imagine other outcomes that might have been considered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When base rates are not well known but must be inferred or researched, they are even less likely to be used.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When analysts make quick, gut judgments without really analyzing the situation, they are likely to be influenced by the availability bias. The more a prospective scenario accords with one’s experience, the easier it is to imagine and the more likely it seems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“History is, by and large, a record of what people did, not what they failed to do.” — E.H. Carr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When observing another’s behavior, people are too inclined to infer that the behavior was caused by broad personal qualities or dispositions of the other person and to expect that these same inherent qualities will determine the actor’s behavior under other circumstances. Not enough weight is assigned to external circumstances that may have influenced the other person’s choice of behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a general rule, biased attribution of causality helps sow the seeds of mistrust and misunderstanding between people and between governments. We tend to have quite different perceptions of the causes of each other’s behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People generally do not accept the notion of chance or randomness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People expect patterned events to look patterned, and random events to look random, but this is not the case. Random events often look patterned… However, events will almost never be perceived intuitively as being random; one can find an apparent pattern in almost any set of data or create a coherent narrative from any set of events.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because of a need to impose order on our environment, we seek and often believe we find causes for what are actually accidental or random phenomena… People also tend to assume that causes are similar to their effects, in the sense that important or large effects must have large causes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People do not have much intuitive feel for how large a sample has to be before they can draw valid conclusions from it. The so-called law of small numbers means that, intuitively, we make the mistake of treating small samples as though they were large ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We seldom take the absence of evidence into account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Information that is vivid, concrete, and personal has a greater impact on our thinking than pallid, abstract information that may actually have substantially greater value as evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most probable hypothesis is usually the one with the least evidence against it, not the one with the most evidence for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doubt is not a pleasant state, but certainty is a ridiculous one.” — Voltaire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To get over this, my way is to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns; writing over the one Pro, and over the other Con. Then, during three or four days of consideration, I put down under the different heads short hints of the different motives, that at different times occur to me, for or against the measure. When I have thus got them all together in one view, I endeavor to estimate their respective weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out. If I find a reason pro equal to some two reasons con, I strike out the three…and thus proceeding I find at length where the balance lies; and if, after a day or two of further consideration, nothing new that is of importance occurs on either side, I come to a determination accordingly. And, though the weight of reasons cannot be taken with the precision of algebraic quantities, yet when each is thus considered, separately and comparatively, and the whole lies before me, I think I can judge better, and am less liable to make a rash step, and in fact I have found great advantage from this kind of equation.” — Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minds are like parachutes. They only function when they are open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A new idea is the beginning, not the end, of the creative process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New ideas result from the association of old elements in new combinations. Previously remote elements of thought suddenly become associated in a new and useful combination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Information that is consistent with an existing mind-set is perceived and processed easily and reinforces existing beliefs. Because the mind strives instinctively for consistency, information that is inconsistent with an existing mental image tends to be overlooked, perceived in a distorted manner, or rationalized to fit existing assumptions and beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Experts overestimate the importance of factors that have only a minor impact on their judgment and underestimate the extent to which their decisions are based on a few major variables. In short, people’s mental models are simpler than they think, and the analyst is typically unaware not only of which variables should have the greatest influence, but also which variables actually are having the greatest influence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When resorting to an analogy, they tend to seize upon the first that comes to mind. They do not research more widely. Nor do they pause to analyze the case, test its fitness, or even ask in what ways it might be misleading.” — Earnest May&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If information does not fit into what people know, or think they know, they have great difficulty processing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is much easier after the fact to sort the relevant from the irrelevant signals. After the event, of course, a signal is always crystal clear. We can now see what disaster it was signaling since the disaster has occurred, but before the event it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings.” — Roberta Wohlstetter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One strategy too often used by intelligence analysts is described as “satisficing”– choosing the first hypothesis that appears good enough rather than carefully identifying all possible hypotheses and determining which is most consistent with the evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…historical analogies often precede, rather than follow, a careful analysis of a situation.” — Robert Jarvis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tendency to relate contemporary events to earlier events as a guide to understanding is a powerful one. Comparison helps achieve understanding by reducing the unfamiliar to the familiar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question is not whether one’s prior assumptions and expectations influence analysis, but only whether this influence is made explicit or remains implicit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Objectivity is gained by making assumptions explicit so that they may be examined and challenged, not by vain efforts to eliminate them from analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simultaneous evaluation of multiple, competing hypotheses permits a more systematic and objective analysis than is possible when an analyst focuses on a single, most-likely explanation or estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray and Vogel introduce the theory behind momentum, what drives the effect, why it should persist, and how to build an improved quantitative momentum strategy that exploits the sustainable edge in investor misbehavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A momentum strategy is simply: buying winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value and momentum strategies are tied to expectation error (from a behavioral viewpoint). Momentum strategies work because of underreaction to positive news, value strategies because of overreaction to negative news. That’s where the similarities end. Value’s focus is on fundamentals to assess price versus intrinsic value. Momentum’s focus is on price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any “anomaly” strategy will continue to work as long as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors, on average, exhibit behavioral biases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors remain short-term performance chasers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, build strategies around areas where investor misbehavior and fund manager incentives (like career risk) or frictions endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-Series Momentum: Or absolute momentum, is based on a stock’s past return, independent of other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-Sectional Momentum: is based on a stock’s past return, relative to other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Behavioral bias + Market frictions = Mispriced assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral-based strategy framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify areas mispricing due to behavior driving prices from fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify incentives and frictions where fund managers are unable or unwilling to act due to high arbitrage costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify areas were high mispricings and high arbitrage costs overlap (where arbitrage costs are high for the majority of managed capital, but low for the individual investor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a good process to exploit it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of high arbitrage costs can be found in career risk: relative underperformance increases career risk. Think of a fund manager who’s decisions are aligned with keeping their job (or avoid losing clients) instead of finding mispriced opportunities because mispriced opportunities bring a higher risk of deviating from the market return in the short term. The higher cost of job loss in the short term outweighs the importance of higher long term returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The next time you hear a market participant suggest that one strategy is better than another strategy, simply ask two basic questions: (1) Why are the securities selected by this process mispriced? and (2) Why aren’t other smart investors already exploiting the mispricing opportunity? Without solid answers to both questions, it is unlikely that the investment process is sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum Basics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research shows that stocks that performed well over the past year, continue to do so in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists when controlled for size and value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works across asset classes, countries, commodities, currencies, and bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robust across time (one study found the effect going back 200 years).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncorrelated with value, offering a diversification benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We use the term momentum to mean a continuation of past relative returns — past winners tend to be future winners, while past losers tend to be future losers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disposition effect — the tendency to sell assets that rose in value (while holding assets that fell in value)  — might explain momentum. In effect, investors lock in gains too soon. They fail to let their winners run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps momentum investing’s edge could be characterized as pessimism in the presence of strong short-term fundamentals, which causes stocks to remain too cheap to future expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum is not the same as growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing monthly randomly drawn top “growth” versus “momentum” stocks, momentum outperformed growth on average over a 50 year period, with significantly lower drawdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum stocks can be growth stocks, value stocks, quality, low-vol… Unlike value, growth, quality, etc., fundamentals don’t factor into momentum stocks at all. High momentum is based on price action alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Momentum investing works because the relative strength indicator is a proxy for a systematic expectation error in the market that predictably reverts in the momentum investor’s favor, on average.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum (high Mom) beats value (high B/M), growth (low B//M), and the broad market based on Ken French data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value and momentum are driven by opposites sides of a similarly biased coin. Value by overreaction — investors are too quick to update views based on new data. Momentum by underreaction — investors are too slow to update views based on new data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum, like any solid strategy, requires discipline because it fails to work all the time. Multi-year periods of market underperformance are likely. The seven-year period of underperformance from 2008 to 2014, is a recent example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Momentum-based stock selection strategies won’t provide extreme insurance-like diversification benefits, but momentum strategies can pack a punch as it relates to overall diversification. For example, long-only momentum strategies are not perfectly correlated to the broad equity market, and they have low correlations with classic value strategies. These features make momentum strategies highly desirable in a portfolio context when they are pooled with value strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to calculate “momentum”? Momentum for a stock is the stock’s total return w/ dividends over a specific period, like the past 12 months. (A generic momentum strategy is built: sort stocks by highest “momentum,” then seed portfolio with the top 30, 50, 100, etc. stocks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-term Momentum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses, at most, a 1-month look-back period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studies show last week’s winners are this week’s losers and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, last month’s winners are this month’s losers and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio rebalanced monthly showed the prior month’s losers beat the winners by a 9% annual return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, prior short term winners become losers and losers become winners in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate Momentum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses a 6 to 12-month look-back period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studies show that winners stay winners and losers stay losers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the effect dissipates after a short while before ultimately reverses (see long term momentum). In other words, using intermediate-term momentum but then held long term results in worse performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio rebalanced monthly showed intermediate-term winners beat losers by an almost 18% annual return (also beat the market).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“…portfolios formed on intermediate-term momentum exhibit a continuation of returns… However, as we discussed earlier, this “continuation” effect does not work if we just buy-and-hold intermediate-term momentum stocks. We must form the portfolio so that the rebalance frequency can capture the abnormal returns associated with the approach.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term Momentum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses a 3 to 5 year (60-months) look-back period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studies show over 3 and 5 year periods, the winners became the losers, and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio rebalanced monthly, based on previous 5-year performance, showed prior long-term losers beat the winners by a roughly 5% annual return (also beat the market).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a general rule, and putting transaction costs aside, the more frequent a portfolio is rebalanced, the better the performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intermediate momentum portfolio examples use a 12-month look-back period but only use the first 11 months for the momentum calculation. The last month is ignored to account for the short-term momentum reversal effect. However, the authors’ state, including the last month does not significantly alter results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varying the holder period and portfolio concentration: returns improve with a shorter holding period and a higher concentration of stocks (shortest holding period tested was 1-month with a concentration of 50 stocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible improvements to a simple momentum strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Smooth” versus “Choppy” Momentum: compare the percentage of days with a positive return relative to days with a negative return. “Smooth” momentum stocks have a higher percentage of positive return days and tend to perform better than “Choppy” momentum stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Boring” versus “Lottery” Momentum: compare average daily return in the past month. “Boring” momentum stocks have a lower average daily return over the past month and tend to outperform “Lottery” momentum stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A proxy for “Boring” versus “Lottery” is low beta versus high beta, where low beta = boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“…momentum profits are larger for stocks with low analyst coverage and for small stocks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human beings suffer from an inability to properly weigh their chances of success for low-probability events. In other words, humans predictably overestimate their chances of winning the lottery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On seasonality effects: “One needs to be skeptical of seasonality-type claims.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the authors argue for a momentum strategy (by rebalancing before quarter-ending month) built around the effects of quarterly window dressing and year-end tax-loss selling. The backtested returns weren’t significantly different enough from a generic mom strategy to be convincing (a 0.48% difference in returns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Window Dressing: the act of fund managers to fill their funds with “winning” stocks before the end of a quarter when holdings are reported. The idea being, dressing up their portfolio with “winners” (while selling “losers”) helps retain clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax Loss Selling: the theory is that year-end tax-loss selling leads to a new year buying spree or the “January Effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equal weighting a generic momentum strategy boosted returns by 2.4%, benefiting from diversification and small-cap effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must emphatically emphasize that investors need to be prepared for the enhanced volatility and drawdown risks associated with momentum strategies — that is a primary reason why this system is expected to work in the future — but this enhanced risk is more than offset by additional expected returns, which is what makes momentum anomalous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing Backtested Maximum Drawdowns: helps answer the question of how much can I lose? Using rolling drawdowns (5-year, 10-year) helps compare the frequency of big drawdowns between multiple strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the pinnacle point of pain, when the most disciplined and hardened active investors earn their keep, the active investor with a clear mind, thorough understanding, and a strong conviction for their process will win. Those who do not fully understand why a process works are more likely to provide the active alpha to the clairvoyant investor who can hold on to an active portfolio like grim death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolio Construction Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A combo portfolio split 50/50 between a concentrated value strategy and momentum strategy (rebalanced quarterly) improved performance while reducing the longer periods of underperformance achieved in a value or momentum strategy alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a trend strategy to the combo value/momentum portfolio reduces large drawdowns significantly, but comes with a cost of a slightly lower return. (Used a simple moving average rule: S&amp;#x26;P 500 Total Return Index – S&amp;#x26;P 500 12-month moving average &gt; 0, go long the combo, otherwise, go long T-bills.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core-Satellite Approach: the “core” portfolio is a passive strategy, with a small percentage — the “satellite” — dedicated to an active strategy, like an 80/20 allocation to core/satellite. It gets a slight improvement over market returns at a minimal cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If one is going to deviate from a passive index, and pay extra management fees, embrace active risk and pay up for concentration, not closet-indexing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We must emphatically emphasize that investors need to be prepared for the enhanced volatility and drawdown risks associated with momentum strategies — that is a primary reason why this system is expected to work in the future — but this enhanced risk is more than offset by additional expected returns, which is what makes momentum anomalous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human beings suffer from an inability to properly weigh their chances of success for low-probability events. In other words, humans predictably overestimate their chances of winning the lottery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If one is going to deviate from a passive index, and pay extra management fees, embrace active risk and pay up for concentration, not closet-indexing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The next time you hear a market participant suggest that one strategy is better than another strategy, simply ask two basic questions: (1) Why are the securities selected by this process mispriced? and (2) Why aren’t other smart investors already exploiting the mispricing opportunity? Without solid answers to both questions, it is unlikely that the investment process is sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We use the term momentum to mean a continuation of past relative returns — past winners tend to be future winners, while past losers tend to be future losers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Momentum investing works because the relative strength indicator is a proxy for a systematic expectation error in the market that predictably reverts in the momentum investor’s favor, on average.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Momentum-based stock selection strategies won’t provide extreme insurance-like diversification benefits, but momentum strategies can pack a punch as it relates to overall diversification. For example, long-only momentum strategies are not perfectly correlated to the broad equity market, and they have low correlations with classic value strategies. These features make momentum strategies highly desirable in a portfolio context when they are pooled with value strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If one is going to deviate from a passive index, and pay extra management fees, embrace active risk and pay up for concentration, not closet-indexing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABCs of Property Management by Ken McElroy is part of the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series of books. Like most Rich Dad, Poor Dad books this is heavy in anecdotes and inspiration, but light on practical how-tos or step by step instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the book is an inspirational sales pitch for the property management industry. Towards the end book, McElroy gives practical advice on how to pick the right property manager. If you are already a property manager, this book references many best practices, but does little to tell you how to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good management practices can and should be applied to properties of any size: from a single family home to large multi-unit towers and apartment complexes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this chapter there is a story about a 200 unit building the author’s company took over. Inside this story there are helpful reminders and anecdotes about the things a property manager should be aware of.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you charging premiums for units on higher floors? With more rooms/square footage?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are your vacant units actually ready to rent?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are maintenance service requests being handled in a timely manner? Long overdue requests increase turnovers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staff: If you are unable to meet your needs, is it a case of being understaffed or a case of staffing the wrong people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even small properties, like single family homes can have major challenges. These challenges do not usually take the form of a single major catastrophe, but instead a series of small mistakes that add up and greatly reduce value (i.e. charging under market rent, deferring maintenance, not signing leases or using improper forms, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most amateur investors rationalize away these mistakes and chalk them up to the property being a “bad investment” when in fact, it was bad management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without management systems in place, you may get lucky for your first few tenants, or even many years of operation. Eventually, however, unsound management practices will catch up to you and result in tens of thousands of dollars in lost rent or damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beyond just the financial impact, poor management can have deep emotional costs: expensive repairs, evicting tenants, or just dealing with late rent is stressful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing rentals long distance is incredibly challenging. The key to success is having a solid team. Consider the following roles for your team:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local broker – someone who understands the market and provide you unique insights and data.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local property manager – someone who understands the changing market and can change with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attorney – to draft and review legal documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due diligence team – people to inspect the entire property and find things that you would otherwise miss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every major city has tons of sub-markets. When managing remotely, it is tempting to use one-size fits all techniques because other rentals in the city use similar techniques. That may cause you to miss out on trends within your rentals’ specific neighborhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With larger properties, the opportunity for losses from small mistakes are greatly amplified. For example, undercharging only $45/month on 100 units translates to $54,000 in lost income per year. At a 4% cap rate, that is $1.35M in value lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with residents is an investors biggest fear. This fear is what drives investors to not make the tough decisions, like not giving the tenant an extra week to pay the rent, not raising the rent, not charging for damages on move-out. Don’t let fear ruin your investment. If you fear this is you, consider hiring a property manager. If you don’t believe you could evict a family, do not manage a property. Hire someone to do that for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When dealing with tenants, you will need to (among other things): find them, collect rent/fees, be a sounding board for them, address their maintenance issues, enforce policies and contracts, deal with intra-resident relationships (in mutli-family).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;maintenance&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#maintenance&quot; aria-label=&quot;maintenance permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintenance is the single most time-consuming and expensive part of owning an investment property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance is also the reason residents move out&lt;/strong&gt;. If they are not happy with your service, they will move down the street, even if it means paying more in rent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One bad maintenance experience is enough to motivate your tenants to shop around for alternative places to live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paying to advertise and re-fill a vacant unit is much more expensive than hiring a handyman to make a simple repair quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relying on a tenant to “take care” of your investment will result in costly deferred maintenance. Hire professionals and keep it in your control. Also, save your receipts–you can deduct the maintenance costs from your taxes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deferred maintenance hurts you in three ways:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rents are reduced because the rental is providing low value to tenants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turnovers are increased, which increases expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sale price is reduced, more so than just the cost of the maintenance. Buyers must also account for lost time and the additional lost rents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Property management companies can achieve economies of scale: they can negotiate lower rates with technicians and have their problems serviced with higher priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your property’s success depends greatly on how well you understand this simple truth: When fixing their homes, tenants expect you to be accommodating to their schedules, not to yours. In fact, they are paying you for this service. In property management, your tenant’s schedule will be your schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple truth: if it takes you 2 weeks to fill a vacant unit, you have lost 2 weeks of potential income. Reduce your turnover time and you will make more money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a standard inspection form for move-in and move-out. Have the tenant sign it and keep it for your records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photographic documentation is best. Not only will it protect you legally, but it will reduce tenant disputes in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At move out, you must do two things: determine how much to deduct from the security deposit and line up the work required on the unit to make it move-in-ready again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people try to save money by doing turnover work themselves. This is pennywise and pound-foolish. On a $1500 unit, every day the unit sits vacant is $50 in lost income. Moreover, the opportunity cost of you directing your labor towards the turnover is higher than that: could you be spending your time in other ways to be increasing your recurring income instead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always perform a background check on your tenants. This should be common sense and should not require explanation. If you disagree, I strongly question your judgment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use standard application forms and charge an application fee to cover all of your expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with professional attorneys to help cover you. Rental laws are complex. You should seek legal help. Why spend hundreds of thousands on an investment property and then choose to save a few hundred bucks by not hiring a lawyer? That savings can cost you tens of thousands later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put simply: in many localities it is incredibly difficult to evict a tenant unless you have proper documentation from the very beginning of the lease. Use a lawyer to get you on the right track so that if you have to evict someone, you don’t find yourself in a situation where you cannot.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key documents and help you should get from your lawyers:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A solid lease compliant with local laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guidance on what needs to be documented and in what format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard notices to be used as required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporating as an LLC for legal liability protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key things to document and forms to always have on hand include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addendums to the lease (parking, pets, disclosures)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move-in/move-out forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community policies and procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resident communication logs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any legal notices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic logs to keep track of potential tenants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always document tenant communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good management plan equates to two tasks: increasing income and reducing expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should think of your only goal as increasing cash flows. Cash flows are the value of the investment. Consider property appreciation as a bonus. You do not control property appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Income – expenses – debt = cash flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential elements for an revenue statement:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross potential rent income: The theoretical maximum rent that could be collected on a property if all units were offered at market rates and had 100% occupancy with paying tenants. Make sure you charge differently based on floor plan, floor, location, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain/Loss to old lease: Gross potential rent/income – Actual potential rent/income. Total amount that could be collected based on your actual leases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concessions: These are free giveaways, like one month free rent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Loss: Other categories of money that is owed to you but you cannot collect/tenants are refusing to pay (e.g. delinquent rent, unpaid late fees, damages). Essentially these are bad debts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vacancy: There are two different types of vacancy to track: physical vacancy and economic vacancy.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical vacancy = Vacancy losses / Gross potential rent income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic vacancy = . Effective rental income / (gross potential rent income – loss to old lease)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective Rental Income = Gross potential rent income – loss to old lease – concessions – other loss – vacancy losses. This is the amount of money you truly collect from rents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Income: All other non-rent income sources, such as fees, parking, laundry, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Income = Effective Rental Income + Other Income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential elements for an operating expenses statement:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional Management: Expected fees paid to professional managers. This book advises against flat rate managers because they lack skin in the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-Site Management/Payroll: Total expenses (including benefits, bonuses, taxes) to required on-site staff. Remember: quality people cost money, Trying to trim costs here too much will result in worse overall performance. Be careful to hire the right people, not just put a warm body in a seat. You will get what you pay for… and if you do not pay enough you will lose more than you save through worse tenant experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrative: Legal fees, basic office supplies, etc. This should remain relatively constant year to year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertising: All expenses related to marketing your property, such as paid listings. Be sure to carefully track your traffic sources so you know where your advertising dollars are being spent best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxes and Insurance: These should be fairly predictable. Contact your tax assessor and shop for insurance quotes if you do not already know these costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilities: Try to put as much as legally possible (and normal for the market) onto the tenant as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repairs and Maintenance: This includes all routine repair work. It does not include appliance replacements or remodeling. Those should be considered capital expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Operating Expenses: The sum of all of factors above (and any additional you find relevant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential elements for a cash flow statement:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Operating Income (NOI) = Total Income – Total Operating Expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital Expenses: Major improvements and upgrades. Generally it is a good idea to keep a cash reserve to help offset unplanned capital expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Income Before Debt =  NOI – Capital Expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt Service: Your mortgage payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash Flow: Income Before Debt – Debt Service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a template for the above in Excel is left as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This list of activities is a typical month for an owner-manager with a full-time job. Let’s cover an 8 unit apartment building renting at $1000/month with 1 vacancy. With one vacancy you are either making very little cash flow or dipping into reserves to continue operating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rent collection usually occurs from the 1st – 3rd of the month.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set specific due dates and charge late fees. Strict enforcement is essential; tenants talk and people will know they can push the limits. Fair housing laws require that you treat everyone the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are tenants paying rent online or via check? If check, you’re spending time cashing checks and chasing people down to give you checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re collecting rent in person, you’re more likely to receive verbal maintenance requests (and have people use the maintenance needs as an excuse not to pay rent).&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most owner-operators want to save money by handling small maintenance themselves. While it does save some money up-front it may be losing you money in several other ways:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a full-time job you have to schedule the repairs farther out into the future, so tenants live with incomplete necessary repairs longer. If the tenants aren’t looking for other places to live, you are probably charging much less than you could be otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are doing unit turnovers yourself, you are likely only working on weekends. The extra time it takes to make units rent-ready is lost income. Leaving a $900 unit vacant for 10 days is $300 in lost rent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tenants expect you to work on their schedule, not yours. This eats into your personal life. You may be saving $100 for an hour of work, but how many hours of stress and travel and time away from your family are you losing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tenants that are delinquent on rent owe you the full rent amount, including late fees. Accepting partial payment means you cannot evict them, since you accepted some payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When considering having someone else do the work, you need to consider whether you have the time and skillset to do the repairs and whether you have the industry contacts to get the work done at a reasonable rate. Are you going to sacrifice time with friends, family, or from work in order to get the required work done?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a bad idea to show a unit that isn’t move-in ready. It greatly reduces the appeal and value of rent you can attract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When advertising a vacant unit, are you only using free methods or effective paid advertising? When showing units, you are only available nights and weekends, so you are somewhat limiting the prospective renters available. Also, many might not make their appointments because they are shopping around for a new place to live, not just yours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to inspect work that subcontractors are doing. Unmanaged contractors will perform work to unmanaged quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book roughly estimates the time commitment for the property at 28 hours per month, not including travel time. If you make the average US hourly rate ($24.57/hr) and a property management company charges 8% of rent, then you lost just under $160 by self-managing, assuming the management company had the units at 100% occupancy and on-time payment. If not, then you would have lost nearly $320.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, property managers do not cover the costs of operating the building. This is still the owner’s responsibility. This includes advertising rentals!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fee-based property management encourages complacency on the part of the manager. Their income should be dependent on their performance. Work hard to find a property manager that structures its fees so your incentives are truly aligned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main advantage of hiring a property manager is you no longer have to invest time and energy into your property. The best property manager is one who never calls. You should take advantage of this and let go of your emotional attachment to the property and its operations! If you cannot let go of the operations, you’re wasting your money. Just manage the property yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, focus your energy on managing the property manager. Try to pick the right management company that can meet your building’s specific needs. Consider the following areas:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age of the building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure(s): single family home? Multi-unit? Common areas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special equipment required?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grounds/landscaping requirements?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amenities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrative needs (on-site/off-site manager).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size of the building/number of units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform research for who you’re looking for on three levels:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 1 research: research you can do from your own home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 2 research: Face to face meetings to verify the information you found earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 3 research: Reaching out to your expert network to get feedback and insight beyond what you found in level 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifically, when looking for a property manager, level 1 research is finding who manages properties in your target market. It is helpful to ask local property owners, too. They will be straightforward on the quality of their managers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you’ve narrowed down the list of potential candidates, meet with them in person. Visit their office, ask about their training, policies, education systems, accounting systems, etc. Check out their properties they manage, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, do additional due diligence. Ask around, talk to industry players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have a solid contract with the property manager and that your incentives are closely aligned. Make sure responsibilities are clearly outlined. Generalizations are not acceptable: they should be clear and explicit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure the management company is a member of trade organizations. This indicates they are interested in improving their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book goes into great detail on different types of property management companies and the pros and cons of various sizes. A greatly condensed list is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National/International: Pros: Generally has standard systems and processes. Cons: Smaller properties get lost/ignored, may not have local knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regional: Pros: Well established network of local vendors. Cons: Tends to have less standardized processes, unable to absorb losses of key employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mom-and-pop: Pros: Highly personalized service. Cons: Rarely have sophisticated systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realty company: Pros: Great knowledge of local market. Cons: Management is not primary focus of business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owner/Resident management: Pros: least expensive option. Cons: May not be full aware of legal issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great companies have excel all three of the following: great employees, robust systems, and solid structure to ensure the employees and the systems interact smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they well trained? Does the company offer continuous training?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they well paid? Low pay leads to poor morale. Poor morale leads to poor profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there documented processes and policies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What system is in place for accounting? Is there an autonomous accounting department or are employees handling the accounting? The latter almost certainly will lead to poor overall results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structures:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does a company have depth? Can it absorb the loss of a key employee?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if the company has policies and processes, how do they ensure they are being followed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A property manager’s job is to add value for the property owner. Think about that for a moment. Do all property managers see their job that way? Probably not.
How can a property manager add value? One way to measure this is to increase the Net Operating Income. The is achieved through several methods: increasing rents, reducing turnovers, reducing utilities fees, and keeping maintenance costs low. Another way to add value is to maintain and improve the property’s value. For investment properties, this is achieved through the steps listed before. In addition, ensuring the low maintenance costs are not creating a deferred maintenance nightmare later down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep value investing takes advantage of mean reversion: that prices eventually move back toward normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To beat the market, you can’t invest with the crowd. You must invest differently than the crowd and be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep value stocks have a built-in margin of safety. The stocks are undervalued because the possibility of a worst-case scenario is already priced in. That gives it a high upside/low downside bet. The worst-case scenario provides a low downside, so you can’t lose much if you’re wrong. But if you’re right, the high upside brings exceptional returns. So even if you’re right as often as you’re wrong, you do okay. Be more right than wrong, you do great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why buy an undervalued failing business? Because of 3 opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its assets have value. The crowd might be selling because of the poor business while ignoring the assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The horrible news surrounding the business turns out to be less bad. With the worst-case scenario off the table, the stock price adjusts higher. (Also, the crowd can overreact by discounting the worst-case scenario. So realizing the worst-case scenario leads to a good return.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activists and private equity seek out poorly managed businesses to be bought out/turned around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition is behind mean reversion. High profits attract competitors, competition eats into the profits and growth, losses cause competitors to fold, which allows for high profits for survivors. It’s a relentless cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The byproduct of mean reversion is undervalued stocks beat the market, expensive stocks fall short. High-growth businesses slow down. High-profit businesses see profits fall. Declining companies turn around. Unprofitable businesses become profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few businesses have sustainably high profits (moats), but finding them are difficult:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses with moats are rare — rarer than the crowd expects. Confusing peak business cycle for a moat is a common mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moats don’t guarantee high profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moats don’t last forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett was closer to a deep value investor during his early partnership days, before transitioning to a “wonderful companies at fair prices” investor. See’s Candies, with its high return on capital, was the catalyst. Dollars reinvested into a business with a high sustainable growth rate, compounds the value of the business over time. A rare company like See’s has a moat that fends off mean reversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of following Buffett is being a poor judge of moats. It’s difficult to tell the difference between an average business at the top of its cycle from a wonderful business…until mean reversion kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acquirer’s Multiple attempts to avoid that risk by buying “fair companies at wonderful prices” (unlike Joel Greenblatt’s Magic Formula, which attempts to replicate Buffett’s “wonderful companies at a fair price” strategy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acquirer’s Multiple compares the total cost of a business (if you were to buy it outright) to its operating income or enterprise value divided by operating earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise Value = market cap plus debt plus preferred stock plus minority interest minus cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Earnings = revenue minus the cost of goods sold minus administrative costs minus depreciation/amortization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A negative EV, in theory, is a good thing — low/no debt with lots of cash. But it’s likely a sign of a bad business that burns through cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using OE makes for easier apples-to-apples comparisons across companies. It takes a top-down approach to the income statement, by including interest and taxes and excluding any one-off special items (non-recurring income) that can inflate/deflate reported earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backtesting shows The Acquirer’s Multiple beats the Magic Formula and the S&amp;#x26;P500 in from 1972 to 2017. It crushed an opposing strategy that buys a basket of stocks with the highest profits (the high profits strategy actually beat the S&amp;#x26;P 500 too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin of Safety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows room for investor error. The deeper the discount to fair value, the bigger the margin of safety, the more room for error, the better the potential return, and the lower the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ex: margin of safety on balance sheet — low debt in relation to cash or size of the business. Excessive debt may lead to financial distress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ex: margin of safety in business — real business with a history of real earnings and cash flows, with no signs of fraud or earnings manipulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Bondt and Thaler (1987) study tested mean reversion on profits. Profit growth on undervalued stocks rose higher than expansive stocks (profit growth actually slowed on expensive stocks). And undervalued stocks beat the market by 41% over 4 years, while the market beat expensive stocks by 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Value Investing Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undervalued stocks beat expensive stocks and the market because stock prices mean revert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROE and earnings growth rates mean revert too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrated Portfolio Trade-off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher Volatility — more volatile than the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher Tracking Error — less likely to track the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple rules beat the experts and the amateurs. Investors who follow a strict set of rules may override the rules to their own detriment. They tend to find a lot of “broken legs” — reasons to avoid a stock the rules would otherwise include — in irrelevant data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mean reversion is the expected outcome. But we don’t expect mean reversion. Instead, our instinct is to find a trend and extrapolate it. We think it will always be winter for some stocks and summer for others. Instead, fall follows summer, and spring follows winter. Eventually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Profit margins are probably the most mean-reverting series in finance, and if profit margins do not mean-revert, then something has gone badly wrong with capitalism. If high profits do not attract competition, there is something wrong with the system and it is not functioning properly.” — Jeremy Grantham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most surprising result of Buffett’s theory of value. Not all growth is good. Only businesses earning profits better than the rate required by the market should grow. Businesses with profits below that rate turn dollars in earnings into cents on the dollar in business value. The owner of the good business wants the business to reinvest and grow because that growth is profitable. The owner of the bad business wants all the earnings paid out because the growth destroys value. Alas, good business can’t absorb much extra capital without profits going down. And bad businesses need all earnings reinvested just to keep up with inflation. For a business to be worth more than its invested capital, it must maintain a profit greater than the market requires.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to maximizing returns is to maximize our chance at mean reversion. That means maximizing the margin of safety. We want the most undervalued stocks. And we want to make sure they survive to mean revert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists focus on excess cash because too much can hurt a company’s value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents, or you might accomplish the opposite—inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are, and you will attain the heights of power.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friends often conceal things to avoid conflict; this can be dangerous.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep friends for friendship, but work with the skilled and competent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you can, bury the hatchet with an enemy, and make a point of putting him in your service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing it as a struggle of good against evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is better to know who and where your opponents are than not to know where your real enemies lie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use decoyed objects of desire and red herrings to throw people off the scent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If people have the slightest suspicions of your intentions at any point in the deception you practice, all is lost. Do not give them a chance to sense what you are up to: Throw them off the scent by dragging red herrings across the path. Use false sincerity, send ambiguous signals, and set up misleading objects of desire. Unable to distinguish the genuine from the false, they cannot pick your real goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hide your intentions not by closing up but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals - just false ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use smoke screens to disguise your actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions require a screen of smoke to distract people’s attention from your real purpose. The bland exterior—like the unreadable poker face—is often the perfect smoke screen, hiding your intentions behind the comfortable and familiar. If you lead the sucker down a familiar path, he won’t catch on when you lead him into a trap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A helpful or honest gesture can divert from a deception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patterns will also help mask a deception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, the key to deception is being bland and acting humble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silence generally makes people uncomfortable - they will jump in and nervously fill the silence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally saying less makes you appear more profound and mysterious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be particularly careful with sarcasm - rarely is it valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful with arousing suspicion or insecurity by being silent.  At times it is easier to blend by playing the jester.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work to establish a reputation of outstanding quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good reputation can save you much - a lot of work is done in advance by your reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once established, always take the high road when attacked.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surround your name with the sensational and scandalous&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw attention to yourself by creating an unforgettable, even controversial, image—court scandal. Do anything to make yourself seem larger than life and shine more brightly than those around you. Make no distinction between kinds of attention—notoriety of any sort will bring you power. Better to be slandered and attacked than ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the beginning of your rise, spend all your energy attracting attention.  The quality of attention is irrelevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create an air of mystery&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an increasingly banal and familiar world, what seems enigmatic instantly draws attention. Never make it too clear what you are doing or about to do. Do not show all your cards. An air of mystery heightens your presence and creates anticipation—everyone will be watching you to see what happens next. Use mystery to beguile, seduce, and even frighten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember: Most people are upfront, can be read like an open book, take little care to control their words or image, and are hopelessly predictable. You will emanate an aura of mystery by simply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering ambiguous phrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, and acting odd in the subtlest of ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not let mystery turn to an air of deceit; it must always seem a game, playful, unthreatening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must secure the credit for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to take advantage of others’ work to further your own cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the past, a vast storehouse of knowledge and wisdom.  Learn this and you will look like a genius.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: be sure to know when letting other people share the credit furthers your cause.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The essence of power is keeping the initiative and forcing others to react, keeping them on the defensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master your anger yet play on people’s natural tendency to react angrily when pushed and baited.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When aiming for power, always look for the indirect route.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbal argument has one use: deception when covering tracks or caught in a lie.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important person to avoid: the sufferer of chronic dissatisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine someone’s history to recognize these people: turbulence, a long line of broken relationships, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other side of infection is equally valid: some attract happiness through good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use this rule to counteract your own undesirable or weak qualities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not mistake independence for power; power requires a relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To cultivate this: possess a talent and creative skill that cannot be replaced.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to give before you take - an actual gift, a generous act, a kind favour, an “honest” admission - whatever it takes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selective honesty is best employed on your first encounter with someone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A history of deceit will cause any act of generosity to be viewed with suspicion—counter by openly embracing your reputation for dishonesty.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not be subtle: you have valuable knowledge to share, you can make him rich, and you can make him live longer and happier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train yourself to see inside others’ needs and interests, and desires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distinguish differences among powerful people and figure out what makes them tick.  When they ooze greed, they do not appeal to charity; when they want to look charitable and noble. Do not appeal to their greed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During social gatherings and innocuous encounters, pay attention.  This is when people’s guards are down, and they will reveal things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a false confession, and someone else will give you a real one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contradict others to stir them to emotion and lose control of their words.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize that you will accumulate enemies who you cannot bring over to your side, and that to leave them any escape will mean you are never secure.  Crush them completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love and seduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another example of this law exists in economics - scarcity increases value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: this law only applies once a certain level of power has been attained.  Leave too early and you do not increase respect, you are simply forgotten. Similarly, absence is only effective in love and seduction once you have surrounded the other with your image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the beginning, make yourself not scarce but omnipresent.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people’s actions. Your predictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behaviour that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsettle those around you and keep the initiative by being unpredictable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictability and patterns can be used as a tool when deceiving.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere—everyone has to protect themselves. A fortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it Protects you from—it cuts you off from valuable information, and it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people, find allies, and mingle. You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retreat to a fortress and you lose contact with your sources of power and your knowledge of what is going on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need time to think, then choose isolation as a last resort, and only in small doses.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognizing the type of person you’re dealing with is critical.  Here are the five most dangerous:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Arrogant and Proud Man&lt;/strong&gt;: any perceived slight will invite vengeance.  Flee these people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hopelessly Insecure Man&lt;/strong&gt;: similar to the proud man, but will take revenge in smaller bites over time.  Do not stay around him if you have harmed or deceived him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Suspicion&lt;/strong&gt;: sees the worst in others and imagines everyone is after him.  Easy to deceive - get him to turn on others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Serpent with a Long Memory&lt;/strong&gt;: if hurt, he will show no anger but will calculate and wait. Recognize by his calculation and cunning in other areas of life - he is usually cold and unaffectionate.  Crush him completely or flee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Plain, Unassuming, and Often Unintelligent Man&lt;/strong&gt;: this man will not take the bait because he does not recognize it. Do not waste your resources trying to deceive him.  Have a test ready for a mark - a joke, a story. If the reaction is literal, this is the type you are dealing with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never rely on instincts when judging someone; instead, gather factual knowledge.  Also never trust appearances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining your independence, you become the master of others—playing people against one another, making them pursue you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1: Do not commit to anyone, but be courted by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay aloof and gain the power that comes from attention and frustrated desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2: Do not commit to anyone - stay above the fray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not let others drag you into their fights.  Seem interested and supportive, but neutral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staying neutral allows you to keep initiative, and take advantage of the situation when one side starts to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You only have so much time and energy - every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to maintain emotional objectivity in the affairs of others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one likes feeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then, is to make your victims feel smart—and not just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intelligence, taste, and sophistication are all things you should downplay or reassure others that they are more advanced than you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are weaker, never fight for honour’s sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover, torment and irritate your conqueror, and wait for his power to wane. Do not give him the satisfaction of fighting and defeating you—surrender first. By turning the other cheek, you infuriate and unsettle him. Make surrender a tool of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of the surrender tactic: inwardly, you stay firm, but outwardly you bend.  Your enemy will be bewildered when properly executed, as they will be expecting retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another—intensity defeats extensity every time. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concentrate on a single goal, a single task, and beat it into submission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: when fighting a stronger enemy, you must be prepared to dissolve your forces and be elusive.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Laws of Court Politics&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Ostentation&lt;/strong&gt;: modesty is always preferable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Nonchalance&lt;/strong&gt;: never appear to be working too hard; your talent must appear to flow naturally, with ease.  Showing your blood and toil is a form of ostentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Frugal with Flattery&lt;/strong&gt;: flatter indirectly by being modest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrange to be Noticed&lt;/strong&gt;: pay attention to your appearance, and find a way to create a subtly distinctive style and image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alter Your Style and Language According to the Person You’re Dealing With&lt;/strong&gt;: acting the same with all will be seen as condescension by those below you and offend those above you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Be the Bearer of Bad News&lt;/strong&gt;: the messenger is always killed.  Bring only glad news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Affect Friendliness and Intimacy with Your Master&lt;/strong&gt;: he does not want a friend for a subordinate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Criticize Those Above You Directly&lt;/strong&gt;: err on subtlety and gentleness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favours&lt;/strong&gt;: it is always better to earn your favours.  Do not ask for favours on another person’s behalf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Joke About Appearances or Taste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Not Be the Court Cynic&lt;/strong&gt;: express admiration for the good work of others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Self-Observant&lt;/strong&gt;: you must train yourself to evaluate your actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master Your Emotions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fit the Spirit of the Times&lt;/strong&gt;: your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with the times, even if the times offend your sensibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a Source of Pleasure&lt;/strong&gt;: if you cannot be the life of the party, at least obscure your less desirable qualities.‍&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first step in the process of self-creation is being aware of yourself and taking control of your appearances and emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second step is the creation of a memorable character that compels attention and stands above the others on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhythm, timing and tempo over time also contribute greatly to the creation of a character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciate the importance of stage entrances and exits.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1: Conceal your mistakes - have a scapegoat to take the blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is often wise to choose the most innocent victim possible as a sacrificial goat.  Be careful, however, not to create a martyr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A close associate is often the best choice - the “fall of the favourite”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2: Make use of the cat’s-paw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use those around you to complete dirty tasks to hide your intentions and accomplish your goals while keeping your hands clean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An essential element in this strategy is concealing your goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices like this are best for approaching those in power or planting information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may also offer yourself as the cat’s paw to gain power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: you must be very careful in using this tactic, as being revealed would be disastrous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to create a cult in 5 easy steps:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep It Vague, Keep it Simple&lt;/strong&gt;: use words to attract attention with great enthusiasm.  Fancy titles for simple things are helpful, as are the use of numbers and the creation of new words for vague concepts.  All of these create the impression of specialized knowledge. People want to hear there is a simple solution to their problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over the Intellectual&lt;/strong&gt;: Boredom and skepticism are two dangers you must counter.  The best way to do this is through theatre, creating a spectacle.  Appeal to all the senses, and use the exotic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Borrow the Forms of Organized Religion to Structure the Group&lt;/strong&gt;: create rituals, organize followers into a hierarchy, rank them in grades of sanctity, give them names and titles, and ask them for sacrifices that fill your coffers and increase your power.  Talk and act like a prophet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disguise Your Source of Income&lt;/strong&gt;: make your wealth seem to come from the truth of your methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up an Us-Versus-Them Dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;: first, make sure your followers believe they are part of an exclusive club unified by common goals.  Then, manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are not interested in the truth about change - that it requires hard work - but rather, they are dying to believe something romantic, or otherworldly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most effective cults mix religion with science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the most pronounced psychological effects of boldness and timidity:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bolder the Lie, the Better&lt;/strong&gt;: the sheer audacity of a bold lie makes the story more credible, distracting from its inconsistencies.  When entering a negotiation, ask for the moon, and you’ll be surprised how often you get it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lions Circle the Hesitant Prey&lt;/strong&gt;: everything depends on perception, and if, on a first encounter, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise, back down, and retreat, you will be pushed around without mercy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boldness Strikes Fear&lt;/strong&gt;; Fear Creates Authority: the bold move makes you seem larger and more powerful than you are.  If it comes suddenly, with stealth and swiftness, it inspires much more than fear - you will be intimidating, and people will be on the defensive in future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the Deeper Grave&lt;/strong&gt;: if you enter action with less than total confidence, problems will cause you to grow confused rather than push through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hesitation Creates Gaps, Boldness Obliterates Them&lt;/strong&gt;: when you take time to think, you create a gap that allows others time to think.  Boldness leaves others no space to doubt and worry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audacity Separates You from the Herd&lt;/strong&gt;: the bold draws attention and seems larger than life.  We cannot keep our eyes off the audacious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of us are timid.  We want to avoid tension and conflict and be liked by all.  We are terrified of consequences, what others might think of us, and the hostility we will stir up if we dare go beyond our usual place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must practice and develop your boldness. The place to begin is in negotiations.  How often do we ask too little?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember: the problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ending is everything. Plan it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give glory to others. By planning to the end, you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ending is everything - the end of the action determines who gets the glory, the money, and the prize.  Your conclusion must be crystal clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some think exposure to how hard they work and practice demonstrates diligence and honesty, but it just shows weakness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprezzatura: the capacity to make the difficult seem easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is understandable is not awe-inspiring.  The more mystery surrounds your actions, the more awesome your power seems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You appear to be the only one who can do what you do, and because you achieve accomplishments with grace and ease, people believe you can always do more.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Withdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the options.  You give people a sense of how things will fall apart without you, and you offer them the choice: I stay away and you suffer, or I return under my conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually find choices between a small number of alternatives more desirable than complete freedom of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following are among the most common forms of controlling the options:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Color the Choices&lt;/strong&gt;: Propose multiple solutions, but present the preferred one in the best light compared to the others.  Excellent device for the insecure master.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force the Resister&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a good technique to use on children and other willful people who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to choose what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alter the Playing Field&lt;/strong&gt;: In this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it doesn’t matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at all costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Shrinking Options&lt;/strong&gt;: A variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the buyer hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent negotiating ploy to use on the chronically indecisive, who will fall for the idea that they are getting a better deal today than if they wait till tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Weak Man on the Precipice&lt;/strong&gt;: He would describe all sorts of dangers, exaggerating them as much as possible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in every direction except one: the one Retz was pushing him to take. This tactic is similar to “Color the Choices,” but with the weak you have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotions—use fear and terror to propel them into action. Try reason and they will always find a way to procrastinate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brothers in Crime&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a classic con-artist technique: You attract your victims to some criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood and guilt between you. They participate in your deception, commit a crime (or think they do), and are easily manipulated. It is often wise to implicate in your deceptions the very person who can do you the most harm if you fail. Their involvement can be subtle—even a hint of their involvement will narrow their options and buy their silence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Horns of a Dilemma&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a classic trial lawyer’s technique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to decide between two possible explanations of an event, both of which poke a hole in their story. They have to answer the lawyer’s questions, but whatever they say they hurt themselves. The key to this move is to strike quickly: Deny the victim the time to think of an escape. As they wriggle between the horns of the dilemma, they dig their own grave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise yourself as the agent of power and punishment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never promise a gradual improvement through hard work; rather, promise the moon, the great and sudden transformation, the pot of gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to fantasy is distance - the distance has allure and promise, seems simple and problem free.  What you are offering, then, should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to find weaknesses:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious Signals&lt;/strong&gt;: everyday conversation is a great place to look.  Start by always seeming interested. Offer a revelation of your own if needed. Probe for suspected weaknesses indirectly.  Train your eyes for details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the Helpless Child&lt;/strong&gt;: knowing about a childhood can often reveal weaknesses, or when they revert to acting like a child.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for Contrasts&lt;/strong&gt;: an overt trait often conceals its opposite. The shy crave attention, the uptight want adventure, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the Weak Link&lt;/strong&gt;: find the person who will bend under pressure, or the one who pulls strings behind the scenes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill the Void&lt;/strong&gt;: the two main emotional voids are insecurity and unhappiness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feed on Uncontrollable Emotions&lt;/strong&gt;: the uncontrollable emotion can be a paranoid fear or any base motive such as lust, greed, vanity or hatred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always look for passions and obsessions that cannot be controlled.  The stronger the passion, the more vulnerable the person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People’s need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.  To do so, all you need to do is find ways to make people feel better about their taste, their social standing, their intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timidity can be exploited by pushing them into bold actions that serve your needs while also making them dependent on you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use The Strategy of the Crown&lt;/strong&gt; - if we believe we are destined for great things, our belief will radiate outward, just as a crown creates an aura around a king.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trick is simple: be overcome by your self-belief.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may separate you from people, but that’s the point.  You must always act with dignity, though this should not be confused with arrogance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dignity is the mask you assume that makes it as if nothing can affect you, and you have all the time in the world to respond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are other strategies to help:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Columbus Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;: always make a bold demand.  Set your price high and do not waver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The David and Goliath Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;: go after the highest person in the building.  This immediately puts you on the same plane as the chief executive you are attacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Patron Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;: give a gift of some sort to those above you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three types of time and how to deal with them:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Time&lt;/strong&gt;: be patient, control your emotions, and take advantage of opportunities when they arise.  You will gain long-term perspective and see further in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forced Time&lt;/strong&gt;: the trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of others - to make them hurry, make them wait, make them abandon their own pace.  Use the deadline, apply sudden pressure, change pace to use this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End Time&lt;/strong&gt;: patience is useless unless combined with a willingness to act decisively at the right moment. Use speed to paralyze your opponents, cover any mistakes, and impress people with your aura of authority and finality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire creates paradoxical effects: the more you want something, the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you.  You need to do the reverse: turn your back on what you want, show your contempt and disdain to create desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of focusing attention on a problem, it is often better not to acknowledge it’s existence:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sour-grapes approach: act as if something never really interested you in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When attacked, look away, answer sweetly, and show how little the attack concerns you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat it lightly if you have committed a blunder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: make sure to show the above publicly, but to monitor the problem privately, making sure it is remedied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Words often go astray, but symbols and the visual strike with emotional power and immediacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find an associate yourself with powerful images and symbols to gain power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most effective of all is a new combination - a fusion of images and symbols that have not been seen together before, but that clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flaunting your pleasure in alien ways of thinking and acting will reveal a different motive - to demonstrate your superiority over your fellows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wise and clever people learn early on that they can display conventional behavior and mouth conventional ideas without having to believe in them. The power these people gain from blending in is that of being left alone to have the thoughts they want to have, and to express them to the people they want to express them to, without suffering isolation or ostracism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only time it is worth standing out is when you already stand out—when you have achieved an unshakable position of power, and can display your difference from others as a sign of the distance between you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;stir-up-waters-to-catch-fish&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#stir-up-waters-to-catch-fish&quot; aria-label=&quot;stir up waters to catch fish permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stir up waters to catch fish.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the essence of the Law: When the waters are still, your opponents have the time and space to plot actions that they will initiate and control. So stir the waters, force the fish to the surface, get them to act before they are ready, steal the initiative. The best way to do this is to play on uncontrollable emotions—pride, vanity, love, hate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angry people end up looking ridiculous.  It is comical how much they take personally, and more comical how they belief that outbursts signify power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should not repress our angry or emotional responses, but rather that realize in the social realm, and the game of power, nothing is personal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reveal an apparent weakness to lure your opponent into action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the face of someone angry, nothing is more infuriating than someone who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: do not provoke those who are too powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are times when a burst of anger can do good, but it must be manufactured and under your control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is offered for free often has a psychological price tag - complicated feelings of obligation, compromises with quality, the insecurity those compromises bring, on and on.  By paying the full price, you keep your independence and room to maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being open and flexible with money also teaches the value of strategic generosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid these people who fail to use money creatively and strategically, or turn their inflexibility to your advantage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Greedy Fish&lt;/strong&gt;. The greedy fish take the human side out of money. Cold and ruthless, they see only the lifeless balance sheet; viewing others solely as either pawns or obstructions in their pursuit of wealth, they trample on people’s sentiments and alienate valuable allies. No one wants to work with the greedy fish, and over the years they end up isolated, which often proves their undoing. Easy to deceive with promise of money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bargain Demon&lt;/strong&gt;. Powerful people judge everything by what it costs, not just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind. And this is exactly what Bargain Demons cannot do. Wasting valuable time digging for bargains, they worry endlessly about what they could have gotten elsewhere for a little less. Just avoid these types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sadist&lt;/strong&gt;. Financial sadists play vicious power games with money as a way of asserting their power. They believe the money they give you allows them to abuse your time.  Accept a financial loss instead of getting entangled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Indiscriminate Giver&lt;/strong&gt;. These people give to everyone, and as a result no one feels special.  Appealing as a mark, but you will often feel burdened by their emotional need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never let lust for money lure you from true power.  Make power your goal and money will find it’s way to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: bait your deceptions with the possibility of easy money, and many will fall for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you cannot start materially from ground zero - it would be foolish to renounce an inheritance- you can at least begin from ground zero psychologically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never let yourself be seen as following your predecessor’s path.  You must physically demonstrate your difference, by establishing a style and symbolism that set you apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeating actions will not re-create success, because circumstances never repeat themselves exactly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success and power make us lazy - you must reset psychologically to counter this laziness.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual —the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoner of goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them—they are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In every group, power is concentrated in the hands of one or two people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When troubles arise, find the source, and isolate them - physically, politically or psychologically.  Separate them from their power base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and breaking them down, gently. Seduce them with a two-pronged approach: Work on their emotions and play on their intellectual weaknesses. Be alert to both what separates them from everyone else (their individual psychology) and what they share with everyone else (their basic emotional responses). Aim at the primary emotions—love, hate, jealousy. Once you move their emotions you have reduced their control, making them more vulnerable to persuasion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play on contrasts: push people to despair, then give them relief. If they expect pain and you give them pleasure, you win their hearts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbolic gestures of self-sacrifice can win sympathy and goodwill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The quickest way to secure people’s minds is by demonstrating, as simply as possible, how an action will benefit them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mirror Effects can disturb or entrance others, giving you power to manipulate or seduce them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are four main Mirror effects:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Neutralizing Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: do what your enemies do, following their actions as best you can, and they are blinded.  A reverse version is the Shadow - shadow your opponents every move without them seeing you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Narcissus Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: look into the desires, values, tastes, spirit of others, and reflect it back to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Moral Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: teach others by giving them a taste of their own medicine. They must realize you are doing to them the same thing they did to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hallucinatory Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: create a perfect copy of an object, a place, a person, that people take for the real thing, because it has the physical appearance of the real thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand: Everyone is wrapped up in their own narcissistic shell. When you try to impose your own ego on them, a wall goes up, resistance is increased. By mirroring them, however, you seduce them into a kind of narcissistic rapture: They are gazing at a double of their own soul. This double is actually manufactured in its entirety by you. Once you have used the mirror to seduce them, you have great power over them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One way to create a mirror for someone is to teach them a lesson through an analogy, avoiding the reactionary increase in resistance you’d encounter if brought up directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: avoid mirrored situations you don’t understand, as those involved will quickly see through it, and the mirrored situation will not live up to the original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrow the weight and legitimacy from the past, however remote, to create a comforting and familiar presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans desire change in the abstract, or superficial change, but a change that upsets core habits and routines is deeply disturbing to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand: The fact that the past is dead and buried gives you the freedom to reinterpret it. To support your cause, tinker with the facts. The past is a text in which you can safely insert your own lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple gesture like using an old title, or keeping the same number for a group, will tie you to the past and support you with the authority of history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either dampen your brilliance occasionally, purposefully revealing a defect, weakness, or anxiety, or attributing your success to luck; or simply find yourself new friends. Never underestimate the power of envy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The envy of the masses can be deflected quite easily - appear as one of them in style and values.  Never flaunt your wealth, and carefully conceal the degree to which it has bought influence. Make a display of deferring to others, as if they were more powerful than you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use envy to motivate you to greater heights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a wary eye for envy in those below you as you grow more successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expect that those envious of you will work against you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasize luck, and do not adopt a false modesty that will be seen through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deflect envy of political power by not seeming ambitious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disguise your power as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a source of happiness for you.  Emphasize your troubles and you turn potential envy into a source of moral support (pity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware signs of envy: excessive praise, hypercritical people, public slandering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: once envy is present, it is sometimes best to display the utmost disdain for those who envy you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand: In the realm of power, you must be guided by reason. To let a momentary thrill or an emotional victory influence or guide your moves will prove fatal. When you attain success, step back. Be cautious. When you gain victory, understand the part played by the particular circumstances of a situation, and never simply repeat the same actions again and again. History is littered with the ruins of victorious empires and the corpses of leaders who could not learn to stop and consolidate their gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The powerful vary their rhythms and patterns, change course, adapt to circumstance, and learn to improvise.  They control their emotions, and step back and come to a mental halt when they have attained success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good luck is more dangerous than bad luck, because it deludes you into thinking your own brilliance is the reason for your success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: There are some who become more cautious than ever after a victory, which they see as just giving them more possessions to worry about and protect. Your caution after victory should never make you hesitate, or lose momentum, but rather act as a safeguard against rash action. On the other hand, momentum as a phenomenon is greatly overrated. You create your own successes, and if they follow one upon the other, it is your own doing. Belief in momentum will only make you emotional, less prone to act strategically, and more apt to repeat the same methods. Leave momentum for those who have nothing better to rely upon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;assume-formlessness&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#assume-formlessness&quot; aria-label=&quot;assume formlessness permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Assume formlessness.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The powerful are constantly creating form, and their power comes from the rapidity with which they can change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself to take nothing personally.  Never show any defensiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you find yourself in conflict with someone stronger and more rigid, allow them a momentary victory.  Seem to bow to their superiority. Then, by being formless, slowly insinuate yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need for formlessness becomes greater as we age, as we become more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a form.  As you get older, you must rely even less on the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember: Formlessness is a tool. Never confuse it with a go-with-the-flow style, or with a religious resignation to the twists of fortune. You use formlessness, not because it creates inner harmony and peace, but because it will increase your power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing events through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out the laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell you what to do, and the sage advice of the elder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: when you do finally engage an enemy, hit them with a powerful, concentrated blow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be wary of friends—they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite—inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelop them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once it slips, however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention by appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious than the bland and timid masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains—then attack. You hold the cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can die from someone else’s misery—emotional states are as infectious as diseases. You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough so that they can do without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. Open-hearted gestures of honesty and generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in their armor, you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gift—a Trojan horse—will serve the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have learned this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people’s actions. Your predictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere—everyone has to protect themselves. A fortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it Protects you from—it cuts you off from valuable information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle. You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs’ clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then—never of fend or deceive the wrong person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining your independence, you become the master of others—playing people against one another, making them pursue you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one likes feeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then, is to make your victims feel smart—and not just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are weaker, never fight for honor’s sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait for his power to wane. Do not give him the satisfaction of fighting and defeating you—surrender first. By turning the other cheek you infuriate and unsettle him. Make surrender a tool of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another—intensity defeats extensity every time. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner. Learn and apply the laws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise in the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions—your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. Maintain such a spotless appearance by using others as scapegoats and cat’s-paws to disguise your involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise ; emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never seem to be in a hurry-hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself, and over time. Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of power—everyone responds to them. Stage spectacles for those around you, then, full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence. Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is offered for free is dangerous-it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise to pay the full price—there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after. If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making: Establish your own name and identity by changing course. Slay the overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual —the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoner of goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them—they are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions, playing on what they hold dear and what they fear. Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to hate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for deception: When you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them overreact. By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror Effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of habit. Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are new to a position of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is necessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head. There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrated Investing profiles eight investors with different investment styles to figure out the principles behind their returns. Was it due to their behavior, the source of capital, the number of investment, or position sizing? The authors answer those questions then look at what the data says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of concentrated investing is simple: most investors are better off owning their top 10 – 15 ideas, instead of spreading money across 50, 100, or 1,000s of ideas, but…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two caveats: (1) Concentrated investing is not for everyone. (2) The book is a roadmap, not a benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lou Simpson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed GEICO’s investment portfolio from 1979 to 2010 averaging a 20.3% return, beating the S&amp;#x26;P 500 by 6.8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was willing it to hold a small number of positions with little turnover, including concentrated sectors bets — multiple stocks from one sector, did M&amp;#x26;A arbitrage, and was willing to hold a cash position absent opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think Independently: Be skeptical, avoid irrational behavior that drives market prices to excess, don’t avoid unpopular companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in shareholder-friendly high-return businesses: uses cash flow as a yardstick, negative free cash flow “chews up owners’ equity,” management owns a sizable stake in the company, is willing to sell off unprofitable operations, and is willing to buy back shares over chasing “less profitable endeavors.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay only a reasonable price, even for an excellent business: “Even the world’s greatest business is not a good investment if the price is too high.” Uses P/E and inverse E/P or earnings yield, and P/FCF as a gauge to value companies. “A helpful comparison is the earnings yield of a company versus the return on a risk-free long-term United States Government obligation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest for the long term: The short term is too unpredictable to guess the swings accurately but would increase transaction costs and taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not diversify excessively: “An investor is not likely to obtain superior results by buying a broad cross-section of the market—the more diversification, the more performance is likely to be average, at best.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often traded around a core position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Maynard Keynes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to the Crash of ’29, Keynes was more of a top-down macro speculator, betting on commodity and currency moves, and doing it on margin. After ’29, he transitioned to more of a concentrated value investor. Though, he continued to use margin in his personal account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynes ran the Chest Fund and a second Fund B for King’s College, as well as advised on the portfolio’s of two Insurance Companies. The Chest Fund earned a 9.12% annual return compared to a UK index of -0.11% over the same period 1928 – 1945.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynes wrote that most investors would never get past the “day-to-day fluctuations in the profits of existing investments, which are obviously of an ephemeral and non-significant character, tend to have an altogether excessive, and even an absurd, influence on the market.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On worrying about certain risks: “some of the things which I vaguely apprehend are, like the end of the world, uninsurable risks and it is useless to worry about them…”  — Keynes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the risk of concentration: “[My] theory of risk is that it is better to take a substantial holding of what one believes in than scatter holdings in fields where he has not the same assurance. But perhaps that is based on the delusion of possessing a worthwhile opinion on the matter.” — Keynes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a diversified portfolio: “The theory of scattering one’s investments over as many fields as possible might be the wisest plan on the assumption of comprehensive ignorance. Very likely that would be the safer assumption to make.” — Keynes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffett on diversification: “If you are a professional and have confidence, then I would advocate lots of concentration. For everyone else, if it’s not your game, participate in total diversification. If it’s your game, diversification doesn’t make sense. It’s crazy to put money in your twentieth choice rather than your first choice.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charlie Munger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlie Munger realized that the biggest problem with most fund types is the ability of clients/partners/shareholders to withdrawal capital at sub-optimal times. Having permanent capital removes that problem, which also helped people like Buffett, Munger, Simpson, Keynes, etc. by not having to think about beating a benchmark or short term returns. Instead, allowing them to maintain a concentrated portfolio with a long term focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger and Buffett found permanent capital via the float of insurance companies and Blue Chip Stamps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger on price: “The desirability of a business with outstanding economic characteristics can be ruined by the price you pay for it. The opposite is not true.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger on concentration: “My own inquiries on that subject were just to assume that I could find a few things, say three, each which had a substantial statistical expectancy of outperforming averages without creating catastrophe. If I could find three of those, what were the chances my pending record wouldn’t be pretty damn good. I just sort of worked that out by iteration. That was my academic study—high school algebra and common sense.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger on where he looked: “I tended to operate, as so many successful value investors do, not looking at Exxon and Royal Dutch and Procter &amp;#x26; Gamble and Coca-Cola. Most of the value investors, if you analyze who’ve been successful over a long time, have operated in less followed stocks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger on companies that bought back stock: “Lou, Warren, and I would always think the average manager diversifying his company with surplus cash that’s been earned more than half the time they’ll screw it up. They’ll pay too high a price and so on. In many cases they’ll buy things where an idiot could see they would have been better to buy their own stock than buy this diversifying investment. And so somebody with that mindset would be naturally drawn to what Jim Gibson used to call “financial cannibals.””&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Rosenfield’s investment principles (as summed up by Jason Zweig):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Do a few things well: Rosenfield built a billion-dollar portfolio not by putting a little bit of money into everything that looked good but by putting lots of money into a few things that looked great. Likewise, if you find a few investments that you understand truly well, buy them by the bucketful.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Sit still: Patience—measured not just in years but in decades—is an investor’s single most powerful weapon.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Invest for a reason: Rosenfield is a living reminder that wealth is a means to an end, not an end in itself. His only child died in 1962, and his wife died in 1977. He has given much of his life and all of his fortune to Grinnell College.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly Criterion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal is to optimize position size for maximum gain while avoiding catastrophic loss, but only when you have an edge. Without an edge, no bet is made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The simplified equation = edge/odds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The purpose of the Kelly Criterion is to maximize the expected value of the logarithm of wealth period by period, but its suggested bets are often very large, and it can be very volatile in the short term. Seeking to avoid the big swings of the Kelly bet, some investors halve the size of the bet recommended by the criterion. This so-called half-Kelly bet achieves three-quarters of the compound return of Kelly with half the volatility. 36 It never pays to bet more than Kelly. Kelly is already the maximal bet for any given edge and odds. Overbetting does not increase the return, but increases the risk to such a degree that it’s likely to reduce growth.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ed Thorp popularized Kelly betting but only recommended fractional-Kelly bets for two reasons: 1) full Kelly bets could produce bigger drawdowns than most could handle, 2) full Kelly bets are likely overestimated due to an underestimated (or error) probability of a catastrophic event (i.e. Black Swans).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorp recognized that Kelly failed to consider the opportunity costs of other positions. He said, “We need to know the other investments currently in the portfolio, any candidates for new investments, and their (joint) properties, in order to find the Kelly optimal fraction for each new investment, along with possible revisions for existing investments.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of a concentrated versus diversified portfolio is the tradeoff between reducing risk through diversity or potentially maximizing returns via concentration. The more diversified you get, taken to an extreme, means a greater likelihood of earning market returns. The more concentrated, taken to an extreme, means a greater likelihood of deviating from the market return but also increases the risks associated with any single stock. So the right number of stocks to own depends on the individual, their skill level, and their ability to handle not only higher volatility that comes with a concentrated portfolio, but permanent losses from any one stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permanent losses are the most important risk to protect against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1977 study, Risk Reduction and Portfolio Size, showed most of the benefits of diversification regarding risk reduction (idiosyncratic risk) was achieved when owning 20 to 30 securities. Owning more produced a minimal increase in benefits. However, the more concentrated portfolios tend to produce a wider range of possible returns that deviate from the market average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Hagstrom, in The Warren Buffett Portfolio, found with portfolio concentration “that reducing the number of stocks in a portfolio increased the chance of generating returns that beat the market. He also found that it increases the chances by the same amount that an investor underperforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors repeated Hagstrom’s study. Using the universe of S&amp;#x26;P 500 stocks, they assembled 1,000 randomly assembled portfolios of each of 250, 100, 50, 30, 25, 20, 15, and 10 stocks. The results show that the average return of each portfolio cluster falls in line with the market average, but the range of possible returns increases as portfolios became more concentrated. So the smaller the portfolio, the more likely its return deviates from the market average. “All that this exercise demonstrates is that concentrating a portfolio improves the chance that the performance of the portfolio deviates from the performance of the underlying index, not that it improves the performance over the underlying index. The expected return of a randomly selected portfolio is still the underlying average. We’re not interested in matching the average. There’s no point attempting to deviate from the market if we don’t intend to outperform it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining a concentrated portfolio with a factor like value, that has shown a history of potential outperformance, increases the chance that the portfolio outperforms the market average in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick O’Shaughnessy shared updated data with the authors from 1964 to 2015: “O’Shaughnessy’s value portfolios ranged in size from as many as 100 stocks to as few as 1 stock. To qualify for selection, each stock needed a minimum market cap of $200 million (inflation adjusted to 2014 dollars). He ranked each stock in the universe on the basis of its fundamental value, defined as an equal weighted combination of its P/E ratio, price-to-sales ratio, enterprise multiple (EBITDA/EV), FCF/EV, and total shareholder yield (its dividend yield plus or minus any shares issued or bought back). Each portfolio was rebalanced on a rolling annual basis to remove any seasonal biases and make the test more robust… O’Shaughnessy found the one-stock portfolios generated the best raw returns at 22.8 percent per year compound. As the number of portfolio holdings swelled from one, the raw returns fell off in rank order. The 25-stock portfolios generated the best Sharpe ratio—a measure of risk-adjusted returns—at 0.85. As the portfolio holdings increased beyond 25 positions, the risk-adjusted returns diminished in rank order. O’Shaughnessy’s research shows that portfolios perform better as they become more concentrated on the most undervalued stocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concentrated portfolio, based on a solid value strategy, only works in the long run, if the investor accepts the likelihood of higher volatility and underperforming the market average in the short run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The right temperament is key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The more broadly a portfolio is diversified, the more likely it is to match the performance of the averages, and the more concentrated a portfolio becomes, the more likely it is to deviate from those averages, either positively or negatively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more concentrated an investor becomes, the greater the portfolio volatility, and performance diverges from the market’s performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.” — Bruce Lee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When times are good, portfolio concentration is popular because it magnifies gains; when times are bad, it’s often abandoned—after the fact—because it magnifies volatility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The singular trait that unites these investors, and separates this group from the herd of investors who try their luck on the stock market is temperament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He believes that a record is built as much on what an investor doesn’t buy, as it is on what he does buy. “We are sort of the polar opposites of a lot of investors,” Simpson said. “We do a lot of thinking and not a lot of acting. A lot of investors do a lot of acting, and not a lot of thinking.” If an investor doesn’t do anything stupid, they can come out well ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I get more and more convinced that the right method in investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which one thinks one knows something about and in the management of which one thoroughly believes. It is a mistake to think that one limits one’s risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence.” — J.M. Keynes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Crucial conversations” are needed when the outcome is important, when people disagree and when emotions are heated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To excel at crucial conversations, you must master the art of engaging in dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To promote effective dialogue, make everyone feel safe expressing what they want to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on what you want to achieve to create a productive dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To elicit more information so you can make better decisions, create a “shared pool” of ideas and understandings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize a crucial conversation by noting certain physical, emotional and behavioural signs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two essential mutual safety conditions for any dialogue are “purpose” and “respect.”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid making someone feel unsafe in a conversation by ensuring that they know you respect them as individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your emotions in a dialogue to stay on task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State what you want, explore what others need, and move on to action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use one of four decision-making methods: “command, consult, vote or consensus.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crucial conversations can often devolve into shouting matches. However, if you learn the right skills, you can master these dialogues and achieve optimal results from them, noticeably improving your personal and professional life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;focus on respect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s okay to ask&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you feel your emotions flaring up, ask the other person if your interpretation of their behaviour is right before freaking out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you understand the subconversations within a difficult conversation, you will be able to manage the issues more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never assume that you understand someone else’s motives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of trying to assign blame, consider how harnessing the associated anger will help you prevent a bad outcome in future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to see the “third story,” the impartial account, rather than fighting over whose story is true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venting your feelings is not useful. Describing them carefully can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t try to control other people’s responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You aren’t perfect, and neither is anyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to get someone to listen to you is to listen to them first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reframing a difficult conversation is a great way to defuse it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick your difficult conversations carefully. You won’t live long enough to have them all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficult conversations are often avoided because you fear the results. The “What Happened?”, Feelings and Identity Conversations can be transformed into Learning Conversations by focusing on curiosity, sharing feelings and refraining from blaming each other. Keeping these things in mind and telling a Third Story will help you and the person you’re talking to have a meaningful conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to your inner voice.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your inner voice is that little sound in your head that remarks on everything you hear, do and read. Sometimes that voice can grow in volume and overpower the voices of others. Instead of muting it, first, listen to it. This way, you’ll discover your true thoughts and train to listen more attentively to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crucial conversations are those everyday interactions that significantly affect your life. They differ from ordinary dialogues because the participants’ opinions vary, their emotions are high, and the stakes are significant. How you deal with these important discussions can have positive or negative results and change the course of your life. Some examples of crucial conversations include breaking up or reconciling with a partner, giving your boss feedback or asking for a pay rise. Often, people shy away from such conversations or handle them poorly. The best way to deal with such situations is to face and handle the conversation skillfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research with more than 20,000 people in hundreds of organizations showed that influential people – those who have successfully achieved their goals and built strong personal and professional relationships – develop an ability to handle crucial conversations effectively. They are skilled in discussing difficult, controversial, high-stakes topics. Cultivating that ability will improve your career prospects, relationships and health. You will increase productivity in your company because you will be better equipped to deal with challenging working relationship topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of mastering crucial conversations is the ability to engage in dialogue. Essentially, this means you can open interaction and converse freely with another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a corporate vice president once had reservations about the CEO’s wish to move to a new location. Others in the firm feared the move but also were afraid to speak up. At a crucial meeting, the VP expressed his concerns in a quiet yet powerfully diplomatic way. The CEO then realized that he had been trying to force his opinion on others and gracefully backed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a successful conversation depends upon the participants providing information and sharing knowledge, sharing information leads to smarter decisions. Even the smartest people are more prone to making mistakes when they don’t have all the necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When two or more people enter a crucial conversation, they don’t share the same thoughts and opinions. Masters of dialogue create an atmosphere where everyone feels safe about adding his or her views to the shared pool of ideas being expressed. Even if someone’s ideas seem wrong, step out of line with prevailing beliefs or provoke controversy, he or she should feel free to articulate them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating this “Pool of Shared Meaning” enables people to make better choices and decisions since they have more accurate, relevant input and information. The process may take time, but the decision will be more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people participate in shaping the meaning of an event, they are more willing to implement its outcome. They act faster and with more commitment. Building this pool of shared meaning by making it safe for others to open up and express themselves is the key to engaging in dialogue in a crucial conversation. Keep your own goals and interests in mind so you can guide the dialogue toward those goals while also considering what others want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, people are more likely to fully commit to solutions resulting from an open dialogue where ideas and information are freely shared. When we see how a solution has been distilled from the available ideas, we’re more likely to be convinced that it’s the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, we tend to resist decisions made without our consultation. We’re more likely to commit to ideas we don’t agree with as long as we can participate in the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-promote-effective-dialogue-make-everyone-feel-safe-in-expressing-what-they-want-to-say&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#to-promote-effective-dialogue-make-everyone-feel-safe-in-expressing-what-they-want-to-say&quot; aria-label=&quot;to promote effective dialogue make everyone feel safe in expressing what they want to say permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To promote effective dialogue, make everyone feel safe in expressing what they want to say.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, how do you master the art of fruitful dialogue? The first step is to “take a long hard look at yourself” and your conversational style. Then “start with the heart.” This means ensuring you engage in a crucial conversation for all the right reasons and concentrating on your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;focus-on-what-you-want-to-achieve-to-create-a-productive-dialogue&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#focus-on-what-you-want-to-achieve-to-create-a-productive-dialogue&quot; aria-label=&quot;focus on what you want to achieve to create a productive dialogue permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Focus on what you want to achieve to create a productive dialogue.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your focus in one of two ways: First, know exactly what you want. This centers your concentration on your goals. When you are engaged in a crucial conversation, you need to ask what you want for yourself, for others and your relationship with the other parties in the discussion. Look to your code, your “North Star,” for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, avoid the “Sucker’s Choice” trap. This occurs when you think you can only choose between two bad options, A and B. However, a better choice, C, is usually available through dialogue if you focus on what you want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent yourself from becoming overly emotional, take a brief moment to focus on what you want to achieve from the dialogue. Ask yourself questions like: What is my aim here? What information do I want to ensure I articulate to my conversational partner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After identifying what you want from the conversation, you can shift your focus to identifying what you don’t want. In other words, what is the one thing you want to avoid in a conversation? You’re liable to want to avoid walking away from it empty-handed ‒ otherwise, you wouldn’t be engaging in a dialogue, to begin with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want to tell your partner something that might upset them, think: What do I want? What do I want to avoid? This simple exercise can help you rationally convey information and keep everyone calm, thus allowing you to say what needs to be said without risking a flying vase to the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To know when a crucial conversation is looming, you must learn to watch out for signs that your discussion is becoming unhealthy. Pay attention to the “content of the conversation” while simultaneously perceiving the “conditions,” such as other participants’ actions, reactions and tone of voice. This pre-emptive protective measure is a form of “social first aid.” To invoke the dialogue process successfully, respond quickly – before emotions mount – to keep it from turning into a casualty case. Avoid engaging in a high-stakes exchange that turns into an argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three key signs will tell you that it is time to act before the conversation becomes a problem:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your discussion involves high stakes, heightened emotions and differing opinions&lt;/strong&gt; – These are sure signs that your conversation is becoming crucial. Look for physical signals, such as your stomach tightening up; for emotional signals, such as feeling scared, hurt or angry; or for behaviour cues, such as raising your voice or pointing your finger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People show signs of feeling unsafe&lt;/strong&gt; – They may become silent or reluctant to speak their minds to protect themselves. Alternatively, they may show signs of aggression, manifesting in name-calling or threatening and domineering behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You feel yourself becoming stressed&lt;/strong&gt; – Take heed if you react silently (by masking your feelings or withdrawing) or violently (by being overly controlling or verbally attacking the person you are speaking to).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people display telltale signs of aggression when they feel unsafe in a conversation. These behaviours can typically be broken down into two categories: silent and violent
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can identify a silent reaction when people start to deliberately hide their opinions in a conversation. A good example is a sarcasm, in which an opinion is deliberately (and obviously) hidden. For instance, someone might tell you, “Wow, what a flattering shirt! No one will ever think it’s three sizes too small for you!”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have an effective dialogue, create an atmosphere where self-expression feels safe for you and the other party. Construct a sense of security when others fall silent or seem to be moving toward anger or violence. Once you see either condition developing, remove yourself from the conversation. Let tensions cool and return to a starting point of mutual concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everyone feels safe again, return to the issue at hand. Two major safety risks can occur, and they require different responses. The first is “mutual purpose,” which can be a casualty of a crucial conversation if others believe you have “malicious intent” or think you want to harm them. Then they won’t trust your motives. In response, look for a united purpose so that others will be willing to listen to your concerns. For example, explain to your boss how his behaviour may hamper productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major safety risk, “mutual respect,” manifests when people sense you are being insolent toward them. As a result, they start to defend their dignity. In response, apologize for any actions that may have shown contempt and emphasize that you respect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this case: A factory employee team has worked through the night to prepare for a site visit from the division vice president. When the VP arrives, he wants to meet with you to discuss the firm’s future rather than conduct a plant tour. You have not communicated this change of plan to the expectant workers, who now have laboured through the night for no reason. When you come face-to-face with them, they irately confront you. “That’s the last time we’re busting our hump for you,” they assert. How should you react? Don’t go on the defensive. Step back and think. Realize that the workers’ anger is a “sign of violated safety.” If you feel mutual intent or respect has gone awry, apologize for the misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinforce your sentiments by using the “contrast technique.” This involves first saying what you did not mean to communicate and then following it up with your intended meaning. For instance, “The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don’t value your work…I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular.” Explain what you want. If you are arguing at cross purposes, use the CRIB technique to frame a mutual purpose: “Commit” to find a mutual purpose, “recognize” an existing purpose or “invent” a new one, and “brainstorm” new approaches and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get annoyed, you are reacting to external events. Therefore, you are making yourself mad, not anybody else. “You and only you create your emotions.” Master your feelings when you are angry, afraid or hurt by following these four steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“See/hear”&lt;/strong&gt; – Start with the facts as you understand them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Tell a story”&lt;/strong&gt; – Explain to yourself what’s happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Feel”&lt;/strong&gt; – Experience certain emotions in response to this knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Act”&lt;/strong&gt; – Take steps based on your feelings and understandings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain complete control over your emotions, retrace this path, one step at a time. Reflect on, question and possibly change one or more elements. Notice the emotions underlying your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examine the stories you tell to determine if your feelings are appropriate and productive. Reconfirm the facts. Recognize your role and motives in creating problems.  Beware especially of three kinds of tales:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Victim sagas”&lt;/strong&gt; – You claim another person is harming you and is at fault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Villain stories”&lt;/strong&gt; – You see the other person as having negative motives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Helpless stories”&lt;/strong&gt; – You depict yourself as unable to resolve a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get what you want, replace stories that trigger negative emotions with stories that provoke positive feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage your emotions by ensuring that you’ve gotten the facts straight before you interpret&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask yourself whether you’re misinterpreting someone’s words whenever you start to feel your emotions flare up. And be sure to separate your explanation from your emotional response so you can stay level-headed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that you have reined in your emotions, you can effectively express your position. Speak to persuade others, but don’t be abrasive, especially when you are involved in controversial or risky discussions. Share your information with confidence, humility and skill. When you are confident, you can speak candidly to say what needs to be said. Humility demonstrates your openness to other people’s opinions, and skill is your ability to speak about touchy subjects with honesty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the “STATE” acronym as a guide in knowing what to say and how: “Share” what you know to be true, “Tell” the story you want to present, “Ask” others to express their stories or paths, “Talk” cautiously and “Encourage” others to speak so you can test the impact your views had on your audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastering crucial conversations also involves listening to others, even when they blow up in anger or shut down in silence. First, ask them to express their point of view. Then (metaphorically), “hold a mirror up to them” to show how you perceive their argument – including body language and tone of voice. Calmly “paraphrase” what you have heard. This creates safety. If you feel the conversation is going nowhere, “prime” the other person into opening up by stating what you believe others may be thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember your ABCs: “Agree” with others where you can, “Build” on what has been said with complete information and “Compare” your path with the other party’s path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make others feel safe in a conversation by creating an atmosphere where they feel their opinions are valued&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start by showing your conversation partner that you care about what’s making them unhappy. Ask them about their motives and, where necessary, confront them on their behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once they start to open up, encourage them to go on by paraphrasing what they’ve said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, however, you might be in a position where you disagree with what your conversation partner tells you. Sometimes, however, you might be in a position where you disagree with what your conversation partner tells you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, turn your conversation into a good decision and mutually accepted united action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do so, choose from these four methods of decision-making:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Command”&lt;/strong&gt; – Allow someone you believe will make a good decision to decide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Consult”&lt;/strong&gt; – Ask others for their input to influence you before you decide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Vote”&lt;/strong&gt; – Agree to whatever most people want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Consensus”&lt;/strong&gt; – Debate the decision until all parties agree on one solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the approach that seems most suitable to the particular situation, so you end up with a clear conclusion. Specify who does what and when. Indicate what follow-up actions you expect. Note the commitments people have made and hold them responsible for their promises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you ever avoid certain people because you don’t want to have a conversation that you need to have? As you imagine how the conversation might play out, do you feel queasy and apprehensive? This is a normal reaction, but avoiding difficult conversations is not the solution. In fact, often it will make things worse. Yet, experience tells you that having the conversation will create a very uncomfortable situation. You wrestle with different approaches and look for just the right diplomatic language to avoid a confrontation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, certain methods can help you deal with this circumstance. Every conversation has a three-part structure, even if the participants don’t realize that such an underlying framework exists. The structure is built on conversations within the conversation. Understanding these internal conversations can help you avoid the pain of letting difficult talks run their usual course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first part of a conversation is “What Happened?” This section, which is about assigning blame and fault, and asserting dominance, can lead to struggles and bad feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second part is about “Feelings.” Whose feelings are appropriate? Do you have a right to your feelings? Do other people have a right to theirs? Often, the conversation does not specifically address the participants’ feelings, but these emotions inform it, and determine its intensity and course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third part is about “Identity,” which is internal to each person. Are you right or wrong? Are you to blame? Do you deserve love?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the conversation threatens your sense of self, shifting your stance to try to regain your balance is natural, even if it does not help the outcome of the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you experience conflict in the “what happened” part of a conversation, the battle is usually about whose version of the truth is true, who had better intentions and how to assign blame. These ideas are illogical. No one has access to the complete truth. No one can know another’s intentions. Surmising just makes things worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this subconversation, each side is certain that the other side is the problem. Worse still, the participants are sure that the other side’s position has no validity and must be abandoned. In reality, both sides have imperfect understandings of the issues, causes and events involved. If they stop exploring the available information, both sides can learn about the other’s perspective and reach an improved outcome. The key isn’t necessarily to synthesize the positions but to embrace both ideas. Try to change your position to a more complex stance closer to reality. Even when you are certain you are right, remaining open-minded is worthwhile because the conversation is generally not really about the subject you are so sure that you have nailed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t believe that you understand someone else’s intentions. That is a trap. The other person often doesn’t understand his or her actions either. As you reflect on the intentions you ascribe to others, can you see a touch of self-justification in your judgment? Explaining your pure motives is also a mistake. Don’t assume that because the other person now understands that you meant well, the impact of your act no longer matters. You probably know what it is like to have your intentions impugned because someone is angry about the results. The fact that you did not intend your act to harm the other person may teach you a lesson in how to treat others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you are part of a bad situation, you soon realize how you contributed to the mess. You wish you hadn’t, but you did. If you bring the wrong materials to a major presentation, blaming your assistant for packing the wrong stuff is easy, but don’t you deserve some blame, too, for not double and triple-checking everything before such an important event?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isn’t your real goal to ensure this mix-up doesn’t happen again? How will making others feel awful and resentful help you get it right next time? Instead, explore each person’s contribution to the problem and determine what each of you can do to ensure a better outcome in the future. This is not easy when feelings are running high, and the embarrassment is fresh, so wait until you regain control of your emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn the “What Happened” Conversation into a Learning Conversation by focusing on curiosity, impact and contribution.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, try to figure out where your opponent is coming from. Instead of, “How on earth can this person be so irrational?” think, “Wow, this person looks at the same situation and comes to completely different conclusions. I wonder what her perspective looks like. Does she know something I don’t? Or has she considered aspects I’ve not thought of?” This will steer you away from feeling offended and toward genuine interest when someone disagrees with your opinion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, don’t assume the person you’re conversing with has bad intentions. Instead, focus on their actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, stop blaming others and start figuring out everyone’s contribution.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blaming someone else won’t solve anything – it’s a backward-looking tactic that focuses on judgment and incites resentment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, sit down with the other person and try to work through the situation together. Try asking, “How did the two of us contribute to this mess?” followed by, “What can we both do to change the situation and move forward?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficult conversations always involve feelings. That is why they are difficult. People block out their feelings to avoid the discomfort of dealing with raging emotions and heated words. You may fool yourself into thinking you can find an objective emotional space. After all, you see yourself as the unbiased party in this argument, although you may be deceiving yourself. Inevitably, your emotions will break through this wall and compromise your “objectivity.” You will find it almost impossible to listen to the other person until you acknowledge your feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing your emotional patterns is important. Even a good person can have inappropriate and destructive emotions. The other party also has emotions that you need to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to find and comprehend the emotions behind the accusations, blame and judgments. Understand that you can negotiate with your feelings and describe them without giving in to them. Don’t think expressing your feelings is the same as constructively dealing with them. Dealing with emotions often matters most at the end of difficult conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve the Feelings Conversation by exploring, negotiating and sharing your feelings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, let’s find out what’s happening deep down. You can do this by exploring your emotional footprint. This is your way of reacting emotionally, guided by what you consider ok to express and what you believe is better kept to yourself
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself questions such as, “How did you learn to categorize some feelings as inappropriate?” “How did you handle feelings as a child?” and “Did your partner scold you for being ‘needy’ when you craved intimacy?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, you have to negotiate those feelings. Feelings aren’t constant – they change depending on our perceptions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like in the “What Happened?” In conversation, you need to focus on curiosity, impact and contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re constantly arguing with your partner, it might be worthwhile to ask yourself, “Do I make assumptions about his intentions? Do I blame him and ignore my impact?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you address your assumptions, you’ll start to feel differently about the situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last step is to thoughtfully share your feelings – both good and bad –.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you just throw your pent-up emotions at the other person, you’ll make a difficult conversation worse. When correctly expressing yourself, you need to let both the good and the bad out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;sense-of-identity&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#sense-of-identity&quot; aria-label=&quot;sense of identity permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sense of Identity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may avoid difficult conversations because you fear the other party’s response could undermine your sense of self in some critical way. Consider the existence of this fear as you think about the difficult conversations you have avoided in the past. Fear of hearing the other side challenge your competence, deny your sense that you are a good person, or assert that you are unworthy of appreciation or love can lead to paralysis of shattering proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore and understand your complex sense of identity more completely. As you determine how the conversation will affect the other party, realize that his or her identity is similarly complex. Give up trying to control other people’s responses, but prepare yourself for their reactions within various possibilities. If you can admit that you are imperfect, that your intentions are mixed and complicated, and that your actions contributed to the problem, you will have taken a big step toward dealing with your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the intricacies of the Identity Conversation and refrain from controlling others’ reactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you tend to judge yourself in absolute terms: competent or useless, mean or kind, capable or incapable of being loved. Absolute terms such as these are limiting because nothing’s black and white, and as a result, you can quickly get confused about your own identity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, reflect on the fact that your identity comprises many components. Think about the different traits that you deem important – characteristics that you’re proud of and afraid of losing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you figure out which parts of your identity you value the most, you can begin to build complexities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another way to enhance the Identity Conversation is by balancing yourself during the talk. To do so, give up the notion that you can control the other person’s reactions. Abandoning that thought makes it easier to focus and remain on course. You might think that your partner won’t get angry if you say something in a particular way. But the truth is you can never predict these reactions. Once you come to terms with that, unexpected reactions won’t be as unsettling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You simply cannot engage in every difficult conversation that presents itself. You don’t have enough time and most of these confrontations simply aren’t worth the effort. So, how do you pick and choose? No hard and fast rules can help you here. Essentially, you must decide which difficult conversations are worth the trouble for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you consider engaging someone in a difficult conversation, begin with the three sub-conversations – what happened, feelings and identity – and see if your purpose makes sense. If not, don’t pursue it. Ask yourself if the real conflict is personal or if you are trying to solve a temporary problem in a way that will have lingering consequences. Consider alternative methods of dealing with the issue. Perhaps you can do something to relieve the situation that provides a better result than you could get from a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One healthy response is simply to learn to let go. Your duty is to step in with your best efforts, not to make the world a better place. You have limitations, and so does the other party. Don’t make everything personal. It isn’t always about you, who you are or what you have done. Learn the other party’s story. Express (without venting) your view on the situation. Share your feelings by describing – not demonstrating – how you feel. Seek to work with the other party to solve the issue together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-third-story&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-third-story&quot; aria-label=&quot;the third story permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Third Story&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t jump into a difficult conversation with your eyes closed. This will agitate the other party, who will respond with his or her story and attack yours. Nothing gets heard, nothing gets accomplished, and everyone gets upset. Instead, consider both sides and the other side’s story without rejecting it outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine yourself as a third party who has to try to discern what is going on. What you hear as a mediator isn’t either party’s story but a third story. Once someone recounts the third story, each side feels able to step back and explore the other’s account. Now, the participants can share their versions without feeling threatened or antagonistic. As you work through such conversations, notice that they aren’t about who is right or wrong; they are about differing information, priorities and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can make the other person feel heard and understood, you will resolve many issues promptly because listening changes the conversation. Instead of resisting other people, you are affirming them and helping them deal with their concerns. If you practice listening to others – with authentic curiosity – you will learn that it helps others listen to you. If you complain to a professional counsellor that someone won’t listen to you, the counsellor is likely to tell you to listen more so you can be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you know to start a difficult conversation with the third story rather than stating your claims. You know how to get other people to listen by listening to them. Now that you are going to be heard, what do you say? Strive for authenticity rather than eloquence. Believe in your right to speak. If you fail to express yourself, you will not fulfill your objectives for the conversation. However, learning this skill takes time. Do not feel obligated to go beyond your level of comfort. Begin with the core issue, be sure your meaning is clear and don’t circle into the conversation. Don’t state your suppositions as final truths. As you talk about them, offer some context about why you believe them. Avoid language that turns your statements into extreme claims. The more you speak from your core, the stronger your conversation will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is to never start inside your own story. Your perspective is seldom a good starting point. This is because your story could threaten the self-image of the person you’re talking to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Third Story is told from an impartial observer’s view. It points out the difference between the tales of the two parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;everything-works-together&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#everything-works-together&quot; aria-label=&quot;everything works together permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Everything Works Together&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you develop these skills, don’t expect other people to respond to a situation as you would. Leading the conversation is up to you. Try reframing the discussion in various ways until you find a method that allows the other person to hear and participate. Use your listening skills early and often, and don’t give up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes reframing and listening aren’t enough. So try to work on clearing the air by naming the problem keeping you from communicating. This can become a distracting side discussion, but it may be useful if the central conversation has stalled. Once you have an actual on-topic conversation, even if you can’t agree, you can work together to solve problems, discuss options and propose alternatives. Just don’t rush things or demand a quick solution. You’re pursuing a good outcome, not trying to win a race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use these five principles to guide you as you prepare for your next difficult conversation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start your preparation by thinking through the three conversations framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide whether the conversation is necessary by considering your purpose in dealing with the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin the conversation with the third story, not your story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore the other two stories: the other parties and yours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage in problem-solving together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you follow these steps, your difficult conversations may still be challenging, but they will be easier and much more constructive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As the saying goes, ‘Life is just one damn thing after another.’ It is, of course. And now you have some skills to handle it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reframing means taking the essence of what the other person says and translating it into concepts that are more helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Explaining your story is clearly a first step toward being understood. But don’t expect instant success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing wrong with not wanting to hurt someone, or wanting them to like you. Yet holding this as a purpose in the conversation leads to trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Engaging in a difficult conversation without talking about feelings is like staging an opera without the music. You’ll get the plot but miss the point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes what’s difficult about the situation has more to do with what’s going on inside you than what’s going on between you and the other person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how we distort others’ intentions is crucial to untangling what happened between us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delivering a difficult message is like throwing a hand grenade. Coated with sugar, thrown hard or soft, a hand grenade is still going to do damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we jump into conversations we typically begin inside our own story. We describe the problem from our own perspective and trigger just the kinds of reactions we hope to avoid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When disagreement occurs, arguing may seem natural, even reasonable. But it’s not helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The time you spend up front establishing a shared pool of meaning is more than paid for by faster, more committed action later on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Practice doesn’t make perfect; perfect practice makes perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A crucial conversation is a discussion between two or more people where (1) stakes are high, (2) opinions vary and (3) emotions run strong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool – even ideas that at first glance appear controversial, wrong, or at odds with their own beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you know how to handle crucial conversations, you can step up to and effectively hold tough conversations about virtually any topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“In business, you don’t get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Strong relationships, careers, organizations, and communities all draw from the same source of power - the ability to talk openly about high-stakes, emotional, controversial topics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The path to high productivity passes not through a static system, but through face-to-face conversations at all levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the best communities, key individuals and groups find a way to engage in healthy dialogue. They talk through important issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disagreement is not a bad thing, nor does it necessarily lead to a difficult conversation. We disagree with people all the time, and often no one cares very much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our initial purpose for having a difficult conversation is often to prove a point, to give a piece of our mind, or to get others to do what we want. In other words, to deliver a message.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful people are not always the smartest, most attractive or best educated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, they succeed because they know how to get along well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People respond to each other on a subconscious level. Research indicates that “as many as 10,000 units of information flow per second” between individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous proven techniques can increase your attractiveness and dynamism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People learn everything they need to know about you within the first few seconds of meeting you. Meanwhile, you are also forming powerful first impressions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You send clear signals about how you feel without saying a word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Fine-tune your smile.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make people feel great about you, focus your conversation on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people are as frightened to make small talk as they appear on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will become a far more intelligent speaker if you simply find substitutes for a few “overworked words” such as “smart, nice, pretty or good.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we consistently overestimate our ability to judge strangers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with the smallest glimmer of information, we judge people we don’t know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are incapable of spotting deception
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we assume truthfulness until the evidence pointing toward deception is overwhelming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, observers believe that most people are telling the truth. To tip from suspicion to disbelief, observers need an absolutely clear trigger. This could be clear agitation, total avoidance of eye contact or someone struggling to find words when directly accused of cheating. Without that trigger, our suspicions remain just that, and we assume truthfulness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people are better at spotting deception, but assuming the truth is important for society to function.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can celebrate perceptive skepticism, but for most of us, it doesn’t matter that we can’t spot lies. Defaulting to truth makes sense, and Bernie Madoff and Ana Montes are outliers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life isn’t like an episode of Friends – what you see on people’s faces doesn’t tell the whole story.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency is the idea that someone’s demeanour reveals an authentic picture of their feelings. It’s one of the primary expectations we have when judging strangers. The problem is that transparency is often completely misleading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When strangers aren’t transparent, we easily and completely misjudge them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some people simply aren’t transparent. They’re mismatched, or their demeanour doesn’t reflect what they’re thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alcohol can make interactions between strangers far worse, with terrible consequences
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a murky situation gets even murkier when alcohol is involved. The author believes that alcohol causes people to become myopic. Alcohol makes us disproportionately focus on short-term wants and forget about long-term consequences. Normally, we maintain a balance between the two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some ways we can get better, and the best way to start is to stop making assumptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans are ill-equipped to understand strangers. We assume that people tell the truth, so we can’t detect lies. And we believe that we can judge strangers based on little, usually deceptive, information. The result of this misplaced confidence is that we don’t invest enough time and patience in truly listening to and understanding each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin believed that similar, easily interpreted expressions – of joy, sadness, fear, surprise, and the like – were consistent for all peoples and cultures. These things are not consistent at all, which explains why people can’t accurately gauge strangers’ emotions or intent across – or even within – cultures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circumstances, Conditions and Context&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gladwell affirms that you must face the additional problem of context beyond your inability to read strangers’ emotions and your powerful bias to believe what they tell you. Where and when you meet a stranger, he emphasizes, matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe during the halcyon years before World War I, “Clever Hans, the counting horse,” was, without a doubt, the most talked-about sensation on the continent. A brilliant entertainer with a unique act, Hans could somehow supply accurate answers to math questions that audience members posed to him. He quickly tapped out the correct answers to any problem – addition, subtraction, multiplication and division – with a hoof. The horse’s owner, Herr von Osten, was always by his side while Hans performed these seemingly miraculous feats – but he never spoke to the horse or signalled him in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one had ever seen such an amazing animal! Expanding beyond math, Hans “learned the alphabet.” By tapping his hoof several times for each letter, he would answer questions from audience members concerning the latest news or subjects such as geography and history. Hans always answered every question correctly. Eventually, scientists and other leaders organized a special commission to investigate the “human horse.” They asked von Osten to leave the hall for their test. Then, they had Hans perform his usual math and language wizardry in front of a crowd. But the horse still did not miss an answer, tapping out correct responses to numerous questions from the commission’s leader. No one could stump the brainy Hans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public insisted that investigators form another commission. Members organized a second test in which the questioner whispered questions in Hans’s ear so no one else could hear. This time, Hans could not answer even a single question correctly. Instead of being brilliant, the horse was revealed as a dummkopf! Can you guess how the commission’s members proved Hans was a fraud? Von Osten had taught the horse to read the audience members’ “body-language signals.” As Hans tapped his hoof, people in the audience would exhibit clear signs of tension – straining forward, holding their breath – until the horse reached the correct number. Then they would all relax, at which point von Osten had taught Hans to stop tapping immediately. Hans was “clever” – but not because he was a math genius or geography expert. He simply knew how to take cues for his actions from the subtle responses of the people around him. “Know your audience” is one of the primary rules of effective communications. Hans, the horse, was able to learn this important lesson. Can you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most accomplished public speakers, actors, politicians and salespeople were not born charismatic. They worked hard to learn how to speak effectively, be appealing, and charm and persuade others. How did they achieve their goals? The answer is simple: They each applied certain remarkably helpful rules of personal communication and, thus, developed themselves into winning and attractive personalities. Yes, such rules exist. Furthermore, they are easy to learn and employ. You can use these secrets and tricks to re-create yourself almost magically into a person of great charm and poise and someone everyone will admire and want to be near.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First impressions are the most lasting. “The way you look and the way you move” provide 80% of the information people use to form their initial impressions of you. To make sure people get an overwhelmingly positive impression when they first meet you, use the following tips:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smile slowly&lt;/strong&gt; – Don’t smile as soon as you meet someone. People will assume that you do this with everyone. Instead, wait a second or two, look long and deep at the person you are meeting, then smile big. This brief delay signals that you are not smiling because it is socially desirable, but because you see something special in this particular person that you really like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Sticky eyes”&lt;/strong&gt; – Show people that you truly can’t take your eyes off of them. Maintain perfect eye contact while you speak with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The big baby pivot”&lt;/strong&gt; – When you meet someone, pivot directly toward him or her with a “total-body turn,” flash a genuine smile, and show the undivided and very special attention you would give to a young child who has just crawled up into your lap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people, including senior executives, motivational speakers and great performers, hate to make small talk. But it is an art that you can easily muster if you follow these tactics:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “mood match”&lt;/strong&gt; – Don’t speak with someone else until you first sample his or her mood. Once you have, ensure that your opening words “match that mood.” This is particularly important for salespeople.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Wear a ‘whatzit’”&lt;/strong&gt; – Starting a conversation with a stranger is not easy. One way to get the ball rolling is to wear something distinctive that he or she is sure to comment upon – a novel tie-tack, a piece of antique jewelry, or a special lapel pin or button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “swivelling spotlight”&lt;/strong&gt; – People love to speak about themselves. Imagine a giant spotlight that rotates to light up your counterpart. Keep the spotlight – and focus – on that person and not yourself. He or she will think you are great for doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can always recognize important people by the commanding, intelligent way they speak. They have confidence, choose the proper words, and don’t use clichés. Follow their lead:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Kill the quick ‘me too!‘”&lt;/strong&gt; – To impress, avoid immediately matching someone else’s account of a personal experience or preference – say, a love of sailing – with your own story. Let your shared interest come out gracefully during the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Comm-YOU-nication”&lt;/strong&gt; – Slip the word “you” into your discourse as often as possible. This focuses the content on the other person and gains his or her attention and approval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid euphemisms&lt;/strong&gt; – Always speak directly and to the point. The use of “nicey-nice” words makes you appear equivocal and weak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;To converse well with others, cure yourself of “Silent Outsider Syndrome.” Use the special words and phrases that are common parlance to the people or group that you want to join:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Learn a little ‘gobbledygook’”&lt;/strong&gt; – People will be impressed with you if you speak in terms they routinely use. Pick up the lingo by listening to others to find out what their special words and phrases mean so you can use them appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hit their “hot buttons”&lt;/strong&gt; – Each professional group has provocative issues – for example, doctors get feisty about their relationships with hospitals. Find out these issues, then mention them to spice up your exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Read their rags”&lt;/strong&gt; – The best way to gain inside knowledge about a specific field is to read the trade journals that report on it. An hour or two in the library can improve your conversational prowess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Generally, people are more comfortable with those with similar values or interests. Your job is to provoke “sensations of similarity” in the thoughts of those you want to get to know:

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Join the movement”&lt;/strong&gt; – Does your conversational partner make herky-jerky movements or languid and graceful ones? Subtly match that person’s movements to make him, or her feel more comfortable with you on a subliminal basis. But don’t go overboard, or you are almost sure to offend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Echoing”&lt;/strong&gt; – What special words and phrases does your conversational partner use to describe something? “Echo” your partner and use those words yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The premature ‘we’”&lt;/strong&gt; – When you pepper your sentences with the word “we,” you establish a subconscious bond with other people involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in the 1930s, Dale Carnegie extolled the virtues of praise in his classic bestseller How to Win Friends and Influence People. The power of praise is just as strong today, but praise that does not appear genuine is certain to backfire, so proceed carefully using these helpers:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Grapevine glory”&lt;/strong&gt; – To praise someone without seeming to be an apple-polisher, speak highly of that person, but not directly to him or her. Instead, voice your compliment to that person’s closest friend or associate. Rest assured that the message will get delivered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Accidental adulation”&lt;/strong&gt; – Sneak praise into an otherwise mundane sentence: “Because you are so knowledgeable concerning…, I’m sure you can set the agenda.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Killer compliments”&lt;/strong&gt; – Use them whenever you can. For example, you can say, “You are the most honest person I know.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may look great, stand tall, dress in style and feel confident – but how do you project these qualities when you speak over the phone? Ensure that you:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Pump up the volume”&lt;/strong&gt; – When you speak over the phone, “turn your smiles into sound.” Be animated and project a positive image through your tone of voice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Name shower”&lt;/strong&gt; – Repeat the other person’s name over and over. A person’s name is their favourite word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Oh wow, it’s you”&lt;/strong&gt; – Always answer your calls in a professional way, then switch to a very sunny, happy demeanour as soon as the caller identifies themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always put the “politician’s six-point party checklist” to work when you attend a function:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Who will be there?”&lt;/strong&gt; – After all, that’s why you’re going, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“When should I arrive?”&lt;/strong&gt; – The best advice is to get there early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What should I take with me?”&lt;/strong&gt; – At a minimum, you’ll need your business cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Why is the party being given?”&lt;/strong&gt; –Be sure and get the true reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Where is the collective mind?”&lt;/strong&gt; – Will it be a party of financiers or environmentalists?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“How am I going to follow up?”&lt;/strong&gt; – Follow up to confirm the contacts you have made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaffes, intemperate or insensitive comments can kill any chance you have to get ahead. To avoid doing damage, keep these strategies in mind:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“See no bloopers”&lt;/strong&gt; – Never comment on the “slips, fumbles and faux pas” of others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Savor the favour”&lt;/strong&gt; – If someone offers to do a good deed on your behalf, wait a little before you try to collect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Chance encounters are for chitchat”&lt;/strong&gt; – You have been trying to schedule an appointment to speak to the boss about increasing your salary for weeks. But don’t bring it up when you run into them in a checkout line. If you do, you’ll never get the raise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot get ahead unless you know how to speak to people so they will want to listen. Fortunately, learning this skill is within anyone’s grasp. Study how successful people accomplish this important goal – and then do what they do. It’s really as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are two kinds of people in this life: Those who walk into a room and say, ‘Well, here I am!’ And those who walk in and say, ‘Ahh, there you are’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No man would listen to you talk if he didn’t know it was his turn next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can convince you of one thing in this book, let it be this: Strangers are not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we confront a stranger we have to substitute an idea – a stereotype – for direct experience. And that stereotype is wrong all too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think we can easily see into the hearts of others based on the flimsiest of clues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The growth mindset does allow people to love what they’re doing—and to continue to love it in the face of difficulties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those with the growth mindset found success in doing their best, in learning and improving. And this is exactly what we find in the champions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fixed mindset: I can’t do it. The growth mindset: I can’t do it yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;fixed-mindsets-vs-growth-mindsets&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fixed-mindsets-vs-growth-mindsets&quot; aria-label=&quot;fixed mindsets vs growth mindsets permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fixed mindsets vs growth mindsets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fixed mindset&lt;/strong&gt; is the belief that the intelligence and qualities a person is born with remain the same throughout his or her life. People with the fixed mindset view failure as intolerable, and spend much of their time trying to prove to themselves and others how smart and/or talented they are. They do not believe in the power of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;growth mindset&lt;/strong&gt; is the belief that with hard work and experience, growth and development occur. This mindset creates a desire to learn. Those with the growth mindset see failure as an opportunity to learn, and they value risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fixed mindsets prevent growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with a Fixed Mindset are often worried about what other people think. As they often judge others based on their aptitude for a task, they also assume others judge them all the time. Hence, people with a Fixed Mindset are obsessed with showing how talented and smart they are. In fact, Carol suggests that those with a Fixed Mindset revolve their whole personality around their talent. Subsequently, they need approval from others to protect their personalities and egos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;growth mindsets encourage development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sky’s the limit for people like this, as they are always seeking to find new ways to learn. Importantly, individuals with Growth Mindsets are not fixated on being better than other people or receiving the best grades. These individuals obtain satisfaction from pushing themselves to the limit to help themselves grow. They will practice relentlessly and are aware that you have to work your hardest, and overcome some failures, to improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with a Growth Mindset enjoy being around people who are more skilled than them. They see spending time with more talented individuals as opportunities to learn new skills. Additionally, these people are always willing to discard a strategy if it is no longer working and replace it with a new approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As well as improving themselves, individuals with a growth mindset encourage the surrounding people to continue learning and working on themselves. They understand that life is about working as a team. When others are happier or more successful, they are more likely to succeed themselves. As business owners, individuals with a Growth Mindset are respectful to their team members and grateful for their work. Additionally, they are open to others’ opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fixed mindsets seek approval; growth mindsets seek development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lou Gerstner took over IBM when it was similarly in a difficult spot. The environment was in a Fixed Mindset and wasting energy on internal disagreements. Each employee was merely doing what was best for themselves. Subsequently, the company was not meeting its customer needs. Gerstner changed this by breaking down the company’s hierarchy, emphasizing teamwork, and rewarding employees who supported their coworkers. Additionally, he put himself on the same level as his employees. This allowed him to engage with as many employees as possible. Gerstner was adopting a Growth Mindset, and this enabled shared development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gerstner’s Growth Mindset enabled him to create a new work environment based on teamwork and development. The focus moved away from individuals’ success and towards shared development. He was able to bring about lasting success at IBM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Mindsets See Failures as Disasters; Growth Mindsets See Failures as Opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of Your Mindset&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carol explains that individuals with a Fixed Mindset do not believe they can learn from their mistakes. Any failure is used as justification for their future being filled with failures. Additionally, any defeat cancels out all the individual’s previous successes. As this approach diminishes their self-confidence, Fixed Mindsets will often blame other people or circumstances for their failures. Alternatively, they will seek ways to cheat to get ahead. Instead of analyzing their weaknesses and improving based on their failures, they try to forget. These behaviors are underpinned by Fixed Mindsets believing that they are the finished product rather than a continual process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carol provides basketball legend Michael Jordan as an example of an individual with a Growth Mindset. Although Jordan is arguably the greatest sportsman ever to live, he was imperfect. He missed some dunks, and he missed some game-winning shots. However, the critical matter is how Jordan responded to these misses. After making mistakes, he would practice the missed shot over and over again. Jordan’s ability to learn from his mistakes and practice these weaknesses brought him so much success. Jordan did not find fault in his teammates or his shoes for his own mistakes. Additionally, it is well-known that Jordan was a driving force behind his teammates’ improvements. Jordan wanted his teammates to be the best they could be. So, he always supported them in improving their game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Mindsets Avoid Difficulties; Growth Mindsets Relish Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While people with a Fixed Mindset get a thrill from easy things, people with a Growth Mindset get a thrill from what is complex. Fixed Mindsets struggle with difficult situations because they have to invest in making a positive outcome out of these situations. Effort is fundamental to success. However, people with a Fixed Mindset see situations where they have to spend more time and energy as a risk. The more time or energy they invest in a situation, the harder it becomes to blame external factors if they fail. The Fixed Mindsets avoid difficult situations as they do not want to question their talent or potentially make a fool of themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE GROWTH MINDSET BUILDS CHARACTER—A KEY COMPONENT TO SUCCESS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Character comes from the growth mindset and the idea that when things go wrong, there are effective strategies that can be used to cope with or overcome them. Character gives a person the ability to keep going even when things get really difficult. It is the ability to stretch yourself beyond what you think is humanly possible, to maintain focus and positivity when things get unbearable, and to consistently work hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those with the fixed mindset focus on proving that they are better than everyone else, while those with the growth mindset strive only to be the best they can possibly be.  They figure out and take the steps necessary to succeed and to keep succeeding. Many great athletes shared that they have found more fulfillment in personal growth than in winning or achieving fame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;impact of your parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our mindsets start developing from birth. However, all babies are born with a Growth Mindset. Babies are curious about the world and want to learn and grow as much as possible each day. Therefore, it is the child’s environment growing up that determines whether the child maintains this Growth desire or eventually adopts a Fixed mindset. The most crucial agent in this shift is usually your parents. Parents have their mindset, and this will set an example for their children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parents with a Growth Mindset will encourage their children to continue learning and questioning everything. Comparatively, parents with a Fixed Mindset will parent through judgment, punishment, and telling the children what is right and wrong. These parenting styles impact babies as young as 1. For example, babies with a Growth Mindset will help other babies when they are crying. In contrast, babies with a Fixed Mindset are annoyed when other babies are crying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of Your Teachers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to parents, teachers are also fundamental role models in defining children’s mindsets. Some teachers adopt a Fixed Mindset by believing the ability of their students is unchangeable. In effect, they believe that some children are naturally intelligent, and others are destined to fail. However, there are many good teachers, also. These teachers will adopt a Growth Mindset by believing all their students are capable of learning anything. The teaching style of these teachers is more adaptable and places faith in the students. Generally, this teaching style helps all students perform better, even those who seemed doomed to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moving towards growth mindsets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A journey towards a Growth Mindset also opens opportunities for developing concrete life plans. Developing a Growth Mindset will take time and the support of others around us. Therefore, we want supportive and honest people who are willing to talk to us about our mistakes and weaknesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;breaking away from fixed mindsets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking away from a Fixed Mindset can be particularly challenging. Fixed Mindsets are habits we have built over many years to protect us emotionally from our failures. Additionally, a lot of us will be reliant on our Fixed Mindset for our self-confidence. Suppose you are genuinely struggling to kick your Fixed Mindset. In that case, Carol suggests that adopting the Growth Perspective in certain situations is enough to have a positive impact. For example, you might accept you are terrible at sport. Despite this, you will apply a Growth Perspective to the most important things: Work, parenting, or studying. Additionally, you don’t only possess one mindset. Most people have elements of both that apply to different areas of their life. Therefore, your first task is to identify which areas you possess which mindset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carol outlines that a Growth Mindset helps make the impossible possible. She encourages each of us to look at the most successful people globally and consider how they would respond to failure. Likely, you will find that they used failures along the way to reach their success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Have Greater Opportunities, but We All Have a Chance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be naive to say that effort is the only thing that’s important in succeeding. Effort is significant and is why those with a Growth Mindset increase their chances of success. Though, many other factors influence your chances of success. For example, Carol explains that resources and opportunities are useful for success. Those born into influential families with better access to education have a much higher chance of success. However, although your starting point matters, this does not mean you shouldn’t improve and create the best endpoint possible based on your opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importantly, Carol concludes by stating that a Growth Mindset does not mean we should try to improve everything. Sometimes the wisest decision is to accept our imperfections, especially those that will cause little harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;applying the growth and fixed mindsets to business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most successful business managers are not natural talents who ooze ego. Instead, they are the individual who is continuously looking to learn. They are also willing to ask questions and are not afraid to fail in front of their employees. They keep faith in their team to improve when they have made a mistake, rather than deeming them failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In contrast, Fixed Mindset bosses are dangerous. They often seek to be controlling and abusive to showcase their superiority. These behaviors push their fellow employees to adopt Fixed Mindsets, as well. Hence, instead of moving forward through learning, the company will be fixated on individual goals. Additionally, they will aim to obtain short-term goals by covering up mistakes and screwing other people over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying the Growth and Fixed Mindsets to Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationships can often be complicated, and most of us will have multiple failed romantic relationships throughout our life. Individuals with a Fixed Mindset see these failed relationships as a defining feature of themselves. They label themselves as unlovable and want revenge for the rejection they have experienced. People with a Growth Mindset will also find rejection difficult. However, they will also see it as an opportunity to reflect on where things went wrong in the relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, the two mindsets have different levels of success in relationships. Relationships based on Fixed Mindsets are destined to fail, as both parties will be expecting everything to be perfect with no effort. Additionally, both parties believe that love can solve everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 actions for you&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about how you can put yourself into a growth mindset more often. What triggers your fixed mindset and how you can deal with it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When praising your children, praise effort and progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about how you can demonstrate growth mindset to your children&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We don’t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, and keep on learning. That way, their children don’t have to be slaves of praise. They will have a lifelong way to build and repair their own confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindset change is not about picking up a few pointers here and there. It’s about seeing things in a new way. When people…change to a growth mindset, they change from a judge-and-be-judged framework to a learn-and-help-learn framework. Their commitment is to growth, and growth take plenty of time, effort, and mutual support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although people may differ in every which way – in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments – everyone can change and grow through application and experience. — Carol Dweck, Mindset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Children with a growth mindset] knew that human qualities, such as intellectual skills, could be cultivated through effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were [the children with a growth mindset]not discouraged by failure, they didn’t even think they were failing. They thought they were learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the consequences of thinking that your intelligence or personality is something you can develop, as opposed to something that is a fixed, deep-seated trait?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Sternberg, the present-day guru of intelligence, writes that the major factor in whether people achieve expertise ‘is not some fixed prior ability, but purposeful engagement’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For twenty years, my research has shown that the view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing that your qualities are carved in stone—the fixed mindset—creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ in every which way—in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments—everyone can change and grow through application and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fixed mindset makes you concerned with how you’ll be judged; the growth mindset makes you concerned with improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you enter a mindset, you enter a new world. In one world—the world of fixed traits—success is about proving you’re smart or talented. Validating yourself. In the other—the world of changing qualities—it’s about stretching yourself to learn something new. Developing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Barber, an eminent sociologist, once said, ‘I don’t divide the world into the weak and the strong, or the successes and the failures…. I divide the world into the learners and non-learners’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in a growth mindset don’t just seek challenge, they thrive on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gave fifth graders intriguing puzzles, which they all loved. But when we made them harder, children with the fixed mindset showed a big plunge in enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For [people with a growth mindset] it’s not about immediate perfection. It’s about learning something over time: confronting a challenge and making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Becoming is better than being’. The fixed mindset does not allow people the luxury of becoming. They have to already be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with the growth mindset know that it takes time for potential to flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College students, after doing poorly on a test, were given a chance to look at tests of other students. Those in the growth mindset looked at the tests of people who had done far better than they had. As usual, they wanted to correct their deficiency. But students in the fixed mindset chose to look at the tests of people who had done really poorly. That was their way of feeling better about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Wooden, the legendary basketball coach, says you aren’t a failure until you start to blame. What he means is that you can still be in the process of learning from your mistakes until you deny them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French executive Pierre Chevalier says, ‘We are not a nation of effort. After all, if you have savoir-faire [a mixture of know-how and cool], you do things effortlessly’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with the growth mindset, however, believe something very different. For them, even geniuses have to work hard for their achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may appreciate endowment, but they admire effort, for no matter what your ability is, effort is what ignites that ability and turns it into accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth mindset does allow people to love what they’re doing—and to continue to love it in the face of difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with the growth mindset found success in doing their best, in learning and improving. And this is exactly what we find in the champions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with the growth mindset found setbacks motivating. They’re informative. They’re a wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with the growth mindset in sports (as in pre-med chemistry) took charge of the processes that bring success—and that maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you wake up each day and your &lt;strong&gt;morning routine&lt;/strong&gt; (or lack thereof) dramatically affects your levels of success in every single area of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miracle Morning Life S.A.V.E.R.S.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silence. Start every morning with a period of purposeful Silence of at least 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affirmations. Program yourself to be confident and successful in everything you do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualization. Imagine what you want to achieve and mentally rehearse what you’ll need to do to achieve it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading. Learn from the experts and model successful people who have already achieved what you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scribing. Writing enables you to document your insights as well as any areas of opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to create your affirmations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What You Want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why You Want It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whom You Are Committed To Being To Create It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What You’re Committed To Doing To Attain It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Inspirational Quotes and Philosophies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to visualize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize What You Want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize Who You Need To Be and What You Need To Do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin with the end in mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underline, circle, highlight, and take notes in the margins of books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-read good personal development books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective Journaling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a Journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide what to write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be intentional and aware of what you do every day when it comes to these 12 areas: your attitude, priorities, health, family, thinking, commitment, finances, faith, relationships, generosity, values and growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often want overnight success and want success without paying the price. We think success comes from luck, productivity, recognition, an event, or connections. &lt;strong&gt;But the secret to success is based on what you do every day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the levels of personal, professional, and financial success you desire, you must first dedicate time each day to becoming the person you need to be, one who is qualified and capable of consistently attracting, creating, and sustaining the levels of success you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you wake up each day and your morning routine (or lack thereof) dramatically affects your levels of success in every single area of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miracle Morning is about recreating the experience of waking up feeling energized and excited and doing it every day for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 5-Step Snooze-Proof Wake-Up Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Your Intentions Before Bed. Create genuine excitement for the next morning every night before bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move Your Alarm Clock Across The Room. This forces you to get out of bed and engage your body in movement. Motion creates energy, so when you get up and out of bed, it naturally helps you wake up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brush Your Teeth. Go directly to the bathroom sink to brush your teeth and splash some warm (or cold) water on your face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink a Full Glass of Water. Hydrate yourself first thing every morning. Fill a glass of water the night before, so it’s already there for you in the morning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Dressed or Jump In the Shower. Either get dressed in your exercise clothes so you’re ready to leave your bedroom and immediately engage in your Miracle Morning, or jump in the shower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miracle Morning Bonus Wake-Up Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a timer for your bedroom light. As your alarm goes off, the lights come on in the room. Or turn your light on first thing when your alarm goes off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a timer for your bedroom heater. Keep a bedroom heater on an appliance timer set to go off 15 minutes before waking up, so you’re not tempted to crawl back under the covers to avoid the cold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

S is for Silence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start every morning with a period of purposeful Silence of at least 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activities to choose from and practice during the period of Silence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prayer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Breathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gratitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t stay in bed for this, and preferably leave your bedroom altogether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miracle Morning Meditation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare your mindset and set your expectations. Let go of your stresses and be fully present in this moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit. Sit up straight on the couch, on a chair, on the floor, or sit on a pillow for added comfort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit upright, cross-legged. Close your eyes or can look down at the ground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin by focusing on your breath, taking slow, deep breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth, and be sure to breathe into your belly rather than your chest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, start pacing your breath; in slowly on a count of 3 seconds, hold it in for 3 seconds, and then breathe out slowly on a count of 3 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you attempt to quiet your mind, thoughts will still come in to pay a visit. Simply acknowledge them, then let them go, always returning your focus to your breath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a constant influx of thoughts, it’s helpful to focus on a single word or a phrase and repeat it over and over again to yourself as you inhale and exhale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

A is for Affirmations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use affirmations to start &lt;strong&gt;programming yourself&lt;/strong&gt; to be confident and successful in everything you do. With enough repetition, your subconscious mind will begin to believe what you tell, act upon it, and eventually manifest it in your reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to create your affirmations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Want&lt;/strong&gt;. Begin with clarifying, in writing, what you want—your ideal vision for yourself and your life—in each area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why You Want It&lt;/strong&gt;. Being crystal clear on your deepest whys will give you an unstoppable purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whom You Are Committed To Being To Create It&lt;/strong&gt;. Get clear on who you need to be and are committed to being to take your life, business, health, marriage, etc., to the next level and beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’re Committed To Doing To Attain It&lt;/strong&gt;. Specify the actions you will need to take consistently to make your vision for your ideal life. Include frequency (how often), quantity (how many), and precise time frames (what times you’ll begin and end your activities). Start small and take manageable steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Inspirational Quotes and Philosophies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to upgrade your affirmations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap into your emotions while reading them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate purposeful physiology, such as reciting your affirmations while standing tall, taking deep breaths, making a fist, or exercising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep updating your affirmations. As you continue to learn, grow, and evolve, so should your affirmations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be consistent with reading your daily affirmations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read positive self-improvement books and articles to program your mind with the thoughts and beliefs that will support you in creating success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

V is for Visualization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualization is the process of imagining exactly what you want to achieve or attain and then &lt;strong&gt;mentally rehearsing&lt;/strong&gt; what you’ll need to do to achieve or attain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly after reading your affirmations—where you took the time to articulate and focus on your goals and who you need to be to take your life to the next level—is the prime time to visualize yourself living in alignment with your affirmations. Start with just five minutes of visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Simple Steps For Miracle Morning Visualization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Ready&lt;/strong&gt;. Sit up tall in a comfortable position. Breathe deeply. Close your eyes, clear your mind, and get ready to visualize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualize What You Want&lt;/strong&gt;. See yourself accomplishing what you set out to accomplish and how good it will feel to have followed through and achieved your goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualize Who You Need To Be and What You Need To Do&lt;/strong&gt;. See yourself engaged in the positive actions you’ll need to do each day, and make sure you see yourself enjoying the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morning exercise should be a staple in your daily rituals. Exercising for even a few minutes every morning significantly boosts your energy, enhances your health, improves self-confidence and emotional well-being, and enables you to think better and concentrate longer.&lt;/li&gt;

R is for Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading is one of the most immediate methods for acquiring the knowledge, ideas, and strategies you need to achieve Level 10 success in any area of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to learn from the experts—those who have already done what you want. The fastest way to achieve everything you want is to &lt;strong&gt;model successful people&lt;/strong&gt; who have already achieved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit to reading a &lt;strong&gt;minimum of 10 pages per day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin with the end in mind. Ask yourself why you are reading that book—what you want to gain from it—and keep that outcome in mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use your reading time to catch up on religious texts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underline, circle, highlight, and take notes in the margins of books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-read good personal development books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scribing=Writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing enables you to document your insights, ideas, breakthroughs, realizations, successes, lessons learned, and any areas of opportunity, personal growth, or improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective Journaling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a Format&lt;/strong&gt;. Decide upfront if you want to go with a traditional, physical lined journal or go digital, such as an online journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a Journal&lt;/strong&gt;. Get a nice and durable journal that you enjoy looking at&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide What To Write&lt;/strong&gt;. You can write about your goals, dreams, plans, family, commitments, lessons learned, and anything else that you feel you need to focus on in your life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit quietly in purposeful silence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read your affirmations out loud from top to bottom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize what it will look and feel like when you reach your goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down some of the things that you’re grateful for, what you’re proud of, and the results you’re committed to creating for that day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a self-help book for 1 minute&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divide the 30-day time frame necessary to implement a positive new habit (or eliminate an old, negative habit) into three 10-day phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Days 1-10] Phase One: Unbearable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first ten days of implementing any new habit, or ridding yourself of any old habit, can feel almost unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these seemingly unbearable first ten days are only “temporary.” It only gets easier from here, and the reward is the ability to create everything you want for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Days 11-20] Phase Two: Uncomfortable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2nd 10-day phase is considerably easier but still requires discipline and commitment on your part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, falling back to your old behaviours will still be tempting. Stay committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Days 21-30] Phase Three: Unstoppable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third 10-day phase is crucial to sustaining your new habit in the long term. The final ten days are when you positively reinforce and associate pleasure with your new habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase Three is also where the actual transformation occurs, as your new habit becomes part of your identity. It transcends the space between something you’re trying and who you’re becoming. You start to see yourself as someone who lives the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success is impossible – So we criticize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success is mystical – So we search for it. (No Quick Fix)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success comes from luck – So we hope for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success is productivity – So we work for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success comes from an opportunity – So we wait for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success comes from leverage -So we power up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success comes from connections – So we network for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success comes from recognition – So we strive for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success is an event – So we schedule it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret of your success is determined by your daily agenda. You will succeed if you make a few key decisions and then manage them well in your daily agenda. You will never change your life until you change something you do daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. Success doesn’t just suddenly occur one day in someone’s life. For that matter, neither does failure. Each is a process. Every day of your life is merely preparation for the next. What you become is the result of what you do today. In other words …YOU ARE PREPARING FOR SOMETHING.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to change, there are only three kinds of people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who don’t know what to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who know what to do but don’t do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who know what to do and follow-through&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;today is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s too late for yesterday, and we can’t depend on tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 ingredients to make today great: decision and discipline
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most successful people in life are the ones who settle (&lt;strong&gt;make decisions&lt;/strong&gt;) their critical issues early and manage them daily. The earlier you settle the critical issues in your life, the greater your potential for success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discipline: the earlier we start, the greater the compound effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knowing that you’re doing your preparation for the future today gives you the confidence that all will be alright tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick two strength areas and one weakness and work on them for 60 days, then re-evaluate and move on to something new if you have made significant progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the area still needs more work, remain focused for another 60 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never work on more than three at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repeat the process until the daily becomes second nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make your day a masterpiece&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Attitude at the beginning of a task affects its outcome more than anything else. When you approach a task—especially an important one you don’t relish—fix your mind on the facts, not your feelings. Focus on the possibilities, not the problems. That will put your attitude on the right track. And if it starts on the right track, it will likely end up at the right destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Attitude towards others often determines their attitude toward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your attitude is a choice. If you desire to &lt;strong&gt;make your day a masterpiece&lt;/strong&gt;, then you need to have a great attitude. If it’s not good now, you need to change it. Make the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;test your attitude when you spend time with others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do they walk away feeling better or worse?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do you clear the air, giving them a fresh perspective and positive encouragement, or do they go away feeling gloomy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your attitude affects how you start and finish your work. The attitude is contagious, so check to see how others respond to you. If you want a better day, you need to change your attitude. Focus on the possibility instead of the problem. Take responsibility for your attitude, change the bad areas of your attitude and think and talk like the person you want to become. Once you’ve decided to have a positive attitude, it will not take care of itself. You need to attend to it daily by following these disciplines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;begin each day with an attitude check and watch for red flags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize that your attitude needs adjustment.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVALUATE PRIORITIES DAILY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities don’t stay put; you must revisit them daily. Why? Because conditions continually change. So do methods of getting things done. Your values, once defined, are going to be steady. You will be able to rely on them. But how you carry them out needs to be flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a survey by Day-Timers, Inc., only one-third of American workers plan their daily schedules. And only 9 percent follow through and complete what they planned.6 If you want to be effective, you must be able to transition to planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you only had six months left to live? What would you do? Priorities are about focus and concentration. It recognizes that time is our most precious commodity, not money. Eliminate the non-essentials. Ask for feedback, take personality tests and evaluate your personal experiences. Think of the Pareto Principle by focusing on the 20% to get an 80% return in life. Priorities help you eliminate the nonessentials in life and leave things undone. Ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is required of me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What gives me the greatest return?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What gives me the greatest reward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set priorities, you need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate priorities daily.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;family life has a profound impact on how you live; it moulds your character and the character of your family members; since your family is the primary environment, it influences the choices to make and the habits you cultivate every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while you can’t do much about your ancestors, you can influence your descendants greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a strong family life, you receive the message that you are loved, cared for, and important. The positive intake of love, affection and respect… gives you inner resources to deal with life more successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family is a haven in a storm. Family can be a source of stability and strength. But we often don’t give them enough of our time. &lt;strong&gt;You can choose how long and how to spend time with them&lt;/strong&gt;. Put your family on your calendar first, and don’t let them have the leftovers in your schedule. Rewrite your definition of success: to be close and care for your family. Make them part of your non-negotiables in your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create and maintain family traditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find ways to spend time together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;express appreciation for each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolve conflict as quickly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success doesn’t come by accident. People don’t repeatedly stumble into achievement and then figure it out afterward. Whether you’re a doctor, a businessperson, a carpenter, a teacher, or a parent, your level of success will increase dramatically if you place a high value on your thinking. The greater your thinking, the greater your potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thinking can increase all value and serve as assets. There are many types of thinking which include: big-picture thinking, focus thinking, creative thinking, realistic thinking, strategic thinking, possibility thinking, reflecting thinking, questioning popular thinking, shared thinking, unselfish thinking and bottom-line thinking. You don’t need to be a master at all the thinking types but simply find people who can compensate for the weak areas. &lt;strong&gt;every day, set aside a certain time to think, find a thinking place and have a system/process that works for you. To think better, you need to&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather good input, capture your thoughts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend time with good thinkers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who desires to achieve and become successful must be like a fine craftsman: committed to excellence. A great craftsman wants you to inspect his work, to look closely at its finest details. In contrast, sloppy people hide their work. And if anyone finds fault with it, shoddy workers find fault with their tools. Which are you most like? Excellence means doing your very best in everything, in every way. That kind of commitment will take you where halfhearted people will never go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, people approach daily commitment in one of two ways. They focus on the external or the internal. Those who focus on the external expect conditions to determine whether they keep their commitments. Because conditions are so transitory, their commitment level changes like the wind. In contrast, people who base their actions on the internal usually focus on their choices. Each choice is a crossroad that will either confirm or compromise their commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect that commitment will be a struggle, but it is worth it. Focus on your choices and stick with them. This requires hard work and dedication. It helps you go when life gets rough, and the pain becomes great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don’t rely on talent alone. Add a strong work ethic to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do what’s right even when you don’t feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognize that money won’t necessarily make you happy. Debt itself will likely make you unhappy as well. And having a financial margin gives you more options. You need to learn how to make money, remain grateful and not compare yourself to others. &lt;em&gt;The author personally lives by this rule: 10% to church and charity, 80% to living expenses and 10% to investments&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;When it comes to financing, ask yourself&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I preoccupied with things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I envious of others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I fight for my values?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I believe money will make me happy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I keep wanting more?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you answered yes to one of these, you need to do soul searching. Materialism is an obsession and mindset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materialism is not about possession—it’s an obsession. I’ve known materialistic people with no money and nonmaterialistic people who possess lots of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;money is nothing but a tool that gives you options&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus on your financial game plan so that you have more, not fewer, options to earn every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;become a good earner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t compare yourself to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give as much as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be grateful for what you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;faith is trusting in advance what will only make sense in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives strength and reduces stress. Studies have shown that people with faith are less likely to fall ill than non-believers. Everyone has faith, including both religious people and Atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace the value of faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith not only can help you through a crisis, but it can also help you to approach life after the hard times with a whole new perspective. It can help you adopt an outlook of hope and courage through faith to face reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, many people hoped that science would provide all the answers to life’s questions. But science cannot do that. Ironically, what is embraced as scientific fact changes from generation to generation? Just look at the way scientists have viewed our solar system. Ptolemy believed the earth was at its center. Copernicus asserted that the sun was at its center, and the planets moved in circular orbits around it. Kepler proved that the orbits were elliptical. Today, scientists no longer argue about the solar system’s structure, but ideas about how it was formed change continually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people give away their relational energy on a first-come, first-served basis. Whoever gets their attention first gobbles up their time and relational energy. That’s why the squeaky wheels instead of the high producers at work consume so much attention and why so many people have nothing left to give when they get home from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people don’t like you… they’ll try to hurt you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they can’t hurt you… they won’t help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they have to help you… they won’t hope you succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they hope you don’t succeed… life’s victories feel hollow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you desire to improve your understanding of people so that you can build positive relationships, then keep in mind the following truths about people—and actions you can take to bridge the gap often caused by them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are insecure … give them confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People want to feel special … sincerely compliment them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People desire a better tomorrow … show them hope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People need to be understood … listen to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are selfish … speak to their needs first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People get emotionally low … encourage them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People want to be associated with success … help them win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will get far in life if you like people because the likable person always wins. Refer to “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie. Place a high value on people, expect the best from them, learn to understand them, listen to people, compliment them, listen to them, speak to their needs and encourage them to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give respect freely but expect to earn it from others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add value to others without expect to receive value in return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;express love and appreciation often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t carry emotional baggage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True generosity isn’t a function of income—it begins with the heart. It’s about serving others and looking for ways to add value to them. That’s the way to achieve significance in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love givers rather than self-centred people. Giving turns your focus outward, adds value to others and helps the giver. You usually feel good after giving. So give others your money, time, and energy. Make yourself valuable but also value others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the purpose of life is not to win but to grow and share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to plan for and model generosity daily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t wait for prosperity to become generous; change your heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a reason to give every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find people to receive every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discrepancies between values and practices create chaos in a person’s life. If you talk about your values but neglect to walk them, then you will continually undermine your integrity and credibility. And that will happen even if you are unaware of your behaviour and are not doing it intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values serve as an anchor, faithful friend and your north star. Many things in life will stand in the way of your values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every day, reflect and review your values&lt;/strong&gt;. Articulate and embrace your values every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See how you can apply and practice your values&lt;/strong&gt;. Compare your values to your practices daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;live out your values regardless of your feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;values are the principles that guide your life. Your values are the deeply held beliefs that authentically describe your soul. They become a companion to you throughout your life and don’t change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the most difficult part of the upward growth climb is putting into practice what you learn. Yet that is where the true value is. The final test of any learning is always application. If what you’re learning can be used to help and improve you or others, then it is worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think our bodies and minds will take care of themselves automatically. We also think knowledge, information and experience are signs of growth. &lt;strong&gt;But it’s about reflecting on the experience and applying the knowledge learned&lt;/strong&gt;. This prevents stagnation in life. We also need to focus on internal change rather than external change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop and follow a personal growth plan&lt;/strong&gt; by setting growth goals and putting yourself in an environment that supports growth. Keep asking yourself: &lt;strong&gt;“what is my potential?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document what you learn and apply it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn to enjoy the journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People without values are adrift on the ocean of life. When the waves come crashing down, they have no place to rest. Any big storm can threaten to put them under. Any current is liable to take them places they don’t want to go. However, when you have strong values, you have something that holds you steady, even when the weather gets nasty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Methods are many, Values are few. Methods always change, Values never do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, 2.5 percent of our income goes to charitable giving. That’s lower than it was during the Great Depression (2.9 percent). And 80 percent of Americans who earn at least $1 million a year leave nothing to charity in their wills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greatness is not defined by what a person receives, but by what that person gives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of home and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand.” – U.S. President Woodrow Wilson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have one true friend in life, you are very fortunate. If you have two real friends, it is highly unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Faith is to believe what we do not see; and the reward of this faith is to see what we believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A faith that hasn’t been tested can’t be trusted”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having money may not make people happy, but owing money is sure to make them miserable”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you owe $1,000, you’re a piker. If you owe $100,000, you’re a businessman. If you owe $1 million, you’re a tycoon. If you owe $1 billion, you’re a magnate. If you owe $100 billion, you’re the government.” – Rose Sand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing is easier than saying words. Nothing is harder than living them, day after day. What you promise today must be renewed and redecided tomorrow and each day that stretches out before you.” –  Arthur Gordon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time a person puts an idea across, he finds ten people who thought about it before he did—but they only thought about it.” Ideas, put into action, give an advantage.” – Alfred Montapert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before going to War—pray once. Before going to Sea—pray twice. Before getting Married—pray three times.” – Russian Proverb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Besides the noble art of getting things done, there is the noble art of leaving things undone. The wisdom of life consists of the elimination of nonessentials.” – Lin Yutang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Guard well your spare moments. They are like uncut diamonds. Discard them and their value will never be known. Improve them and they will become the brightest gems in a useful life.” British prime minister William Gladstone said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is a wise man who wastes no energy on pursuits for which he is not fitted; and he is wiser still who from among the things he can do well, chooses and resolutely follows the best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.” – “John Wooden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All things being equal, attitude wins. All things not being equal, attitude sometimes still wins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his time when it comes.” -Benjamin Disraeli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How you wake up each day and your morning routine (or lack thereof) dramatically affects your levels of success in every single area of your life”.
“By simply changing the way you wake up in the morning, you can transform any area of your life, faster than you ever thought possible”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every day you and I wake up, we face the same universal challenge: to overcome mediocrity and live to our full potential”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always remember that where you are is a result of who you were, but where you go depends entirely on who you choose to be, from this moment on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must realize that the real impact and consequence of each of our choices and actions—and even our thoughts—is monumental, because every single thought, choice, and action is determining who we are becoming, which will ultimately determine the quality of our lives. As T. Harv Eker said in his best-selling book Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, ‘How you do anything is how you do everything’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time you choose to do the easy thing, instead of the right thing, you are shaping your identity, becoming the type of person who does what’s easy, rather than what’s right”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you do choose to do the right thing and follow through with your commitments—especially when you don’t feel like it—you are developing the extraordinary discipline (which most people never develop) necessary for creating extraordinary results in your life.  As my good friend, Peter Voogd, often teaches his clients: ‘Discipline creates lifestyle’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the alarm clock goes off, and we hit the snooze button (the easy thing), most people mistakenly assume that this action is only affecting that moment. The reality is that this type of action is programming our subconscious mind with the instructions that it is okay for us to not follow through with the things we intended to do”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always remember that who you’re becoming is far more important than what you’re doing, and yet it is what you’re doing that is determining who you’re becoming”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Virtually all highly successful people—from CEOs to professional athletes to the President of the United States—embrace a high degree of accountability”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Accountability is the act of being responsible to someone else for some action or result”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here’s the problem: accountability was never something you and I asked for, but rather something that we endured as children, teens, and young adults. As it was forced upon us by adults, most of us unconsciously grew to resist and resent accountability altogether”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our levels of success will rarely exceed our level of personal development, because success is something we attract by who we become”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Remember this truth: now matters more than any other time in your life, because it’s what you are doing today that is determining who you’re becoming, and who you’re becoming will always determine the quality and direction of your life”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time you hit the snooze button, you’re in a state of resistance to your day, to your life, and to waking up and creating the life you say you want”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been said that nobody actually likes waking up early, but everyone loves the feeling of having woken up early.The first key to waking up is to remember [to set your intentions before bed]: Your first thought in the morning is usually the last thought you had before you went to bed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you keep your alarm clock next to your bed, then you are still in a partial sleep-state when the alarm goes off, and it makes it much more difficult to wake yourself up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s crucial that you hydrate yourself first thing every morning. After 6-8 hours without water, you’ll naturally be mildly dehydrated, and dehydration causes fatigue”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One that stood out for me is the idea that there are three major breakthroughs throughout human history. And each was prompted initially by geographical factors — purely incidental and arbitrary you could say, which gave certain areas of the world a leg-up in achieving unprecedented development and subsequently more advanced form of civilization as measured by Morris’ four metrics of human society. However, since we are instinctive animals produced by millions of years of evolution, some of the primal desires are coded in our DNA. That is, by design, we humans gravitate towards some sort of equality; more specifically, “equity in outcomes on emotional grounds and fairness in opportunities on rational basis”. Thus, when the advancement finally spreads to other parts of the world, whether by design or by chance, the inhabitants of those places would naturally want to adapt (if they in fact see it as such). And if they don’t, as exemplified by the Chinese Qing Dynasty refusing to concede to Western “tricks and gimmicks” (what we now call science and technology), there is a dear price to pay. But of course, eventually history will power through any willful ignorance and blind denial, and incorporate them into the process one way or another, no matter how “central” they think they are (Note: China, or Zhong Guo, essentially means “the central country” in Chinese). To adapt or to perish, it’s a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts out by covering a broad topic: human civilization. From attempting to understand our shared two-million-year-old past, Lu hopes to gain some foresight as to what awaits us in our future. A few books he referenced are also a few of my favorites on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jared Diamond — Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yuval Noah Harari — Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ian Morris — Why the West Rules — For Now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E. O. Wilson — The Social Conquest of Earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From these books, Lu introduces our civilization in three stages:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civilization 1.0 — Hunter-Gatherer Age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civilization 2.0 — Agricultural Age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civilization 3.0 — Industrial/Technological Age (modern civilization)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jared Diamond famously stated that the rise of European and Asian powers in the Agricultural Age was predetermined by geography and climate. Out of all the edible grains in the world, only five (wheat, corn, rice, barley and sorghum) stood out as the main sources of energy consumption for humans. When it comes to animal husbandry, out of 148 mammals on earth, we were only able to domesticate 14 types of animals. In addition, out of the five most important domesticated animals today (sheep, goats, cows, pigs and horses), four could trace their origins to Southwest Asia. Naturally, where these grains grow and harvest the best and where these animals were able to survive would also determine where humans flourished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental difference between civilizations 2.0 and 3.0 is that 2.0 operates under a system characterized by shortages. That is, the growth of a society is limited by its agricultural output, which is in turn dictated by natural forces such as seasons, climate and photosynthesis. Once a society grows to a certain size, it inevitably falls into the Malthusian trap, where a significant amount of the population has to die out in order for the society to revert back to a point of equilibrium. Sounds incredibly cruel and reminiscent of Marvel’s almighty, mission-driven, almost reasonable villain, Thanos, who decided that half of randomly selected humans must perish (like, literally turning into ashes) in order to save the Earth and so he set out to do just that. Well, guess what? Civilization 3.0 powered by free market and technological advancements and capable of unlimited growth, come to rescue. I know, I know. We also run a greater risk of perishing altogether thanks to our unbounded power to destroy, you smart son of a gun. Can we just play along for now? Anyhow, the West boarded the first 3.0 train this time around and developed so quickly like no one had seen before. In the proceeding centuries, several Asian countries followed, first Japan, then South Korea, Singapore, now China. They all showed likewise pattern regardless of their political systems: one-party, two-party or multi-party rule; direct or indirect democracy; capitalism or communism — different paths, same destination that is unlimited, explosive, constant economic growth and a civilization of materialistic abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the book’s focus on civilization, however, revolves around “civilization 3.0” — industrial revolution, technological revolution and modernization. Lu starts out the discussion at Axial Age, a period between 8th to the 3rd century BCE, named by German philosopher Carl Jaspers. During these years, humans “leveled up” their thinking and understanding of philosophy and religion and achieved cultural and spiritual awakening. The thinkers during these years still influences the way we think today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In China, philosophers like Confucius, LaoZi, and Mozi along with the Hundred School of Thoughts appeared during the Warring States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Nepal and India, we witnessed the birth of the Buddha, hinduism, buddhism, along with nihilism and scepticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Middle East, prophets started recording their teachings and thoughts, forming the basis for modern Catholic and Islamic faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Greece and western Europe, Homer and Plato became immensely popular, influencing Christianity and even Renaissance that came centuries afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaspers noted in his book Origin and Goal of History that these great thinkers shared many similarities. They all existed in a period of great struggle and uncertainty, with governments that were autocratic and corrupt. Their audiences were mainly the lowest class of citizens, minorities, and the repressed. Although their teachings were often revolutionary, they weren’t actual revolutionists. The intent was often simpler: to understand the meaning of life and what makes a society fairer and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu’s interpretation here is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;human nature dictates that emotionally we pursue the equality of results (resources and money) and rationally the equality of opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a very important notion. By linking human nature directly with the pursuit of equality and fairness, he is able to explain to his readers that the following are the the greatest innovations of human civilization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free market economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ke Ju (科举制, civil service examination system based on meritocracy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ke Ju (科举制)&lt;/strong&gt; came first. The Chinese imperial examination system (~220 B.c.) was used to recruit talent from all over the country to make up its governing body. It took both attitude and aptitude into consideration, and promised a fair, open, and transparent chance for all, regardless of family background or upbringing like the systems prior. Because of this universal recruiting method, China was able to incentivize talent to participate in government and politics, provide upward mobility for its citizens, and to economically lead the world for more than ten centuries afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lying beneath the seemly mundane surface are two protruding factors that likely affected the trajectory of either societies as far as I can see based on what I learned from the book. First of all, despite of its tremendous benefits, Keju has its flaws and is far from enough to sustain China’s evergrowing population and advancing society. It grants political privileges to whomever willing to and capable of passing a series of examinations, that promised a pathway for anyone (theoretically) to rise to political prominence. But! Ultimately there’s a limit to how far one can go. That is, the throne. And given the position of the highest ruler can only be inherited, not earned, it is up to that one individual and his (yes, the vast majority, if not all, of them were men) select trustees, often related to him by blood or through marriage as well, to determine what happens to the entire empire — the largest on earth at the time. It is their wisdom, character, knowledge and ability the whole country relies upon for peace, survival and continuation. If that’s not a crapshoot I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keju was also limited in its rigidity, though technically it didn’t have to be. Ming Dynasty is infamous for its turning its bureaucrat selection system into a “word prison” or, perhaps more fittingly, “hell of words”. The empire’s gradual loss of toleration in free thoughts and original ideas, and eventually loss of interest in assessing candidates on what could be practical or functional in serving the empire, which is what the Keju system was designed to do, probably predated the rise of Ming Tai Zu (first Emperor of Ming Dynasty) by many centuries. And the reason behind that, in hindsight at least, is pretty clear. Whatever the system was selecting, it was meant to serve the ruler, the throne, the product of the crapshoot that may or may not (and most likely not) care about the millions of people outside of his fortress, whom supposedly were born to serve him, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is no mentioning of economic meritocracy alongside its political counterpart. It is well-known that businessmen are at the very bottom in terms of the traditional Chinese hierarchy of noble career choices for the plebs. I’m referring to the “bureaucrats, peasants, craftsmen, and businessmen” (in descending order)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the 1200s and &lt;strong&gt;Magna Carta&lt;/strong&gt;, then 1689 and the &lt;strong&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/strong&gt;, Europeans slowly started taking power away from the crown and into the hands of the “people” (represented by the wealthy). In Britain, these important policy changes marked the transition to limited constitutional monarchy, arguably equally significantly, the first “commercial constitutional state” — one where the House of Commons represents the interests of businessmen and property owners. It sets Britain up to become the indisputable commercial hub of the 17th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also at this critical juncture in history, a transcontinental trade network was quietly being established in the Atlantic, starting with the discovery of the Americas in end of the 15th century. &lt;strong&gt;The Transatlantic Trade Network&lt;/strong&gt; was the first decentralized market ecosystem not controlled by a single nation state and an experiment of true free capitalism. The pros and cons of such a bold experiment are still being felt today, from social issues like racism in the Americas to economic ones like the impact of globalization and monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu also reiterates the importance of free market economy by pointing out that 1776 was a special year, where a series of important events happened that officially transitioned the western world into civilization 3.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adam Smith’s &lt;strong&gt;Wealth of the Nation&lt;/strong&gt;, setting the foundation of a free market economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Founding Father’s &lt;strong&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/strong&gt;, creating rule of law and centuries of prosperity in a new nation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Watt steam engine&lt;/strong&gt; is commercialized and the design is sold to Carron Company ironworks, officially kicking off the industrial revolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Smith is well known today as the father of economics and modern capitalism. Almost weekly on CNBC, people still reference the “invisible hand” of the market, a concept Adam Smith coined to describe the automatic pricing mechanism in an economy. Adam Smith’s concept of the &lt;strong&gt;“invisible hand”&lt;/strong&gt; was less biased than modern interpretations. Today, the free market ideology largely uses it to justify that while unfettered by the intervention of government regulations, society would flourish organically due to the competition that it naturally fosters. A smaller government should always function better because it leaves room for private ownership and partnerships, and creates as little resistance to the “invisible hand” as possible. Greed of the consumers that demand the best product at the lowest price would drive the market to a point of absolute efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Declaration of Independence&lt;/strong&gt; and the steam engine need no further introduction. Lu highlights the importance of &lt;strong&gt;rule of law&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;technological achievements&lt;/strong&gt; in the modernization of the western world, the former surrendered by the monarch, and the latter made possible by free market competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;monopolies-and-the-free-market&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#monopolies-and-the-free-market&quot; aria-label=&quot;monopolies and the free market permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Monopolies and the Free Market&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monopolies took many forms throughout human history — from forms of governments like city states and nation states to joint stock companies like the EICs (East India Company). There seems to be a natural tendency for humans to form these all powerful entities in order to achieve greater degree of control. Lu proposes another way to look at monopoly that I never considered before: a global marketplace being a monopoly, from which he summarizes the Iron Law for the Civilization 3.0:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一个自由竞争的市场就是一个不断自我进化、自我进步、自我完善的机制，现代科技的介入使得这一过程异常迅猛。这样在相互竞争的不同市场之间，最大的市场最终会成为唯一的市场，任何人、企业、社会、国家，离开这个最大的市场之后就会不断落后，并最终被迫加入。一个国家增加实力最好的方法是放弃自己的关税壁垒，加入到这个全球最大的国际自由市场体系里去；反之，闭关锁国就会导致相对落后。这就是3.0文明的铁律。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The only way to survive is to join in on the biggest global free market. Any entity attempting to create barrier (ie raise tariffs), break away to create smaller regional markets, will eventually become obsolete and will be forced to rejoin the monopoly later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lu, humans fought for control over land in civilization 2.0 (Agricultural Age). In civilization 3.0, we fight for the control over the global market monopoly. The size of an economy’s market determines its longevity. After WWII, United States gave up a lot of land it captured. Instead, it started forming a series of global organizations, such as the United Nations, World Bank, IMF, and Bretton Woods. These international organizations essentially set up a global marketplace. The U.S. also fought hard to hold on to the rights of creating, changing, and enforcing the rules of this marketplace. Initiatives like the Marshall Plan and security treaties with Japan and Korea can also be seen as such efforts. The establishment of a global marketplace also greatly accelerated the effect of globalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globalization is a very unique phenomenon in human history. A completely global free market economy we have today really only existed for 30 years or so, since the end of the Cold War in 1989. During the Cold War, we had two major economic sphere of influences. Both superpowers used trade sanctions, embargoes, and blockage of financial access as means of economic warfare. Eventually, only one market prevailed, and we are living in a world order created by that monopoly today: &lt;strong&gt;dollar is the dominant world currency, english is the world’s language, Hollywood is the world’s culture, and the U.S. military is the world’s police force.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To discuss the Chinese economy, it’s hard not to talk about John Maynard Keynes. The Keynesian school of economics largely came out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. Contrast to Adam Smith, Kaynes believed that the “visible hand” of the government can help stabilizing the economy through manufactured demand and centralized workforce, thus pulling the U.S. out of economic depressions via increased governmental debt and expenditure. MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) can be seen as an extension of Keynesian Economics. And China has been riding the quasi-MMT train for quite a while&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese businesses deeply understand the meaning of this “visible hand” from its government. For thousands of years, the Chinese government had always managed its economy, effectively creating a repeated business cycle of opening, prosperity, intervention, lockdown, and reopening. In the past 40 years after Deng, the Chinese economy entered another “opening and prosperity” phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu noted that even though the exponential growth of China has been impressive, the trend is unlikely to continue unless certain policies are significantly altered going forward. When an economy is transitioning from “developing” to “developed,” it’s relatively easy to follow the path that others have laid before and copy as much as they can. This playbook isn’t new either — almost all Asian countries (Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand to a lesser extent) rose up in the 90s with the help of central planning. A famous account of Japanese Central Bank’s aggressive policies in the 80s and 90s, such as window guidance, can be found in Richard Werner’s book Princes of the Yen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period of prosperity, the Chinese government relied heavily on exporting manufacturing (cheap labor) and smart/effective central planning. They guided investments and capital domestically and internationally into important infrastructure projects and achieved unprecedented progress in a short period of time. However, as China surpasses the U.S. and became the number one export nation in 2019, it now needs to turn inwards to seek additional growth. At the same time, as investments continue to creep up and make up almost half of China’s GDP, the government will be forced to let go of some of its control on the economy, and give more leniency to the “invisible hand” of the free market. The takeaway here is simple: &lt;strong&gt;a centrally planned economy is a short term, opportunistic band-aid solution; it can never be as effective as free market economy during a time of uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt; — when there’s no more path laid out in front by others, governments tend to react slower and are at a position of disadvantage. Hence, Lu lays out his first prediction of China’s future: &lt;strong&gt;it has to transition from a government-controlled economy to a government-assisted free economy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this prediction seems overly optimistic, though still quite fun to think about. As China transforms itself into a domestically service oriented economy, consumers will likely demand a more open and transparent society (or at least a fairer financial market). State-owned enterprises (国企) should not be able to borrow the same way they do today, with basically no obligation to repay debt without fear for bankruptcy. Any citizen should be able to participate in the industries that are traditionally limited to certain state-backed companies (finance, energy, or even defense). Financial markets will have to be regulated to attract more institutional capital and stability. Pension systems and social welfare can then be more privatized and therefore not solely be the burden of the central government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thought-provoking takeaway from the later part of the book is central government’s place in a nation’s economy. After all, “free market is by no means free”, Li observes. Indeed, to ensure the proper functioning of a large free market is no small undertaking. It requires tremendous amount of funds and effort that no individual company or industry could or, I would argue, should provide. That said, Li agrees that governments have different roles to play depending on a country’s stage of economic development. There are two turning points marking three stages of economic development in a post-agricultural society. The first being the Lewis Turning Point raised by English economist W. Arthur Lewis. Before the arrival of this turning point, Lewis proposes, capital has absolute dominating power over labor. Labor skills are low and often in high supply thanks to former agricultural workers pouring into cities for higher-paying modern jobs. Therefore, wages are uniformly low, so are unit price and profit margin. At this stage saving may be citizens’ main goal; thus, it makes sense for government to indirectly participate in the economy — borrowing money from the savers and invest it into the economy either by lending to sprouting businesses or by establishing state-owned enterprises to build and strengthen infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to see all economies hang out in this sweet spot till the end of time; however, history teaches us that nothing lasts. Increasingly we see developed countries, burdened by low birth rate and aging population, having low or negative interest rates. Fiscal policy that used to work like magic for the longest time stopped working; people became more and more reluctant to spend no matter how low interest rates are. This phenomenon was brought to spotlight by economist Richard Koo, observing the lack of vitality in Japanese economy since the 1990s. Once a society arrives at this stage, it would again make sense for the “Big Brother” to take action and assume an active role in the economy as in stage I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality, of course, is not as clear-cut. And governments around the world are generally large, cumbersome political machines characterized by bureaucracy, inertia and latency in execution. The size of a country matters, and so do culture and ingrained beliefs and perception about the government’s role. For countries like China, where for centuries central government has always taken on an active role on the economic stage, it may be hard to convince policy makers at various levels to chill out a little and loosen their grip on the economy. However, with China approaching (some may say having passed) the Lewis Turning Point, this becomes increasingly important and should be done sooner rather than later. I’m fairly hopeful it will happen though. After all, thanks to modern-day version of Keju, China’s got the most capable and efficient bunch of bureaucrats working towards its renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, countries heading towards or perhaps had already crossed the second turning point, given their long-running democratic tradition, may have a hard time adjusting to the fact that even the most powerful machine — the free market — may need an oil change. This can finally become reality in the US with Trump disgracefully shooed out of the White House. Will American government show as much vigor and determination as T.R.’s administration did back in the Great Depression? Will Americans, increasingly radicalized and divided, be on board? I sure hope so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;culture&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#culture&quot; aria-label=&quot;culture permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Culture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author focused on the issue of &lt;strong&gt;culture and tradition abandonment&lt;/strong&gt; by most Chinese living in China today. He believes that a country’s culture is “consisted of centuries of habits and traditions, religions and history.” It’s an all-encompassing belief and faith system that cannot be replaced, it’s “deep in the bones.” Through cultural revolution, China had attempted to erase just that. The author predicts that in the near future, we will see a movement of &lt;strong&gt;Chinese Culture Renaissance&lt;/strong&gt;. To him, Chinese people must learn to embrace their own culture again before moving into the civilization 3.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of governance and politics, Lu briefly covered three major schools of thought: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ru(儒) or Confucianism&lt;/em&gt;, Dao(道) or Taoism, Fa(法) or Legalism&lt;/strong&gt;. In Chinese politics, it is often believed that achieving a balance among the three can guarantee the success of a dynasty or ruler. Lu believes another school of thought, &lt;strong&gt;Mo(墨) or Mohism&lt;/strong&gt; should play a more pivotal role as China enters its modernization phase. Mohism emphasizes &lt;strong&gt;universal love, social order, sharing, and honoring the worthy. Equality for all&lt;/strong&gt; is also a major theme in Mohism, which might be why it did not gain much popularity during the dynastic rules of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu believes that as society advances, the balance between &lt;strong&gt;individualism vs. collectivism&lt;/strong&gt; will inevitably tilt in favor of the former. In an advance economy, individuals should dictate terms and politics and become the entirety of politics (by the people and for the people). Therefore, individual rights such as freedom, safety, and private ownership of properties must be protected, and should be the only function of a government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Lu, a modernization of the Chinese culture is just as crucial as the modernization of the Chinese economy. An example he gave was the idea of traditional cardinal human relations, called &lt;strong&gt;Wu Lun (五伦八德)&lt;/strong&gt;. It describes five different sets of relationships and defines the proper societal behavior depends on one’s role in such relationships:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中国传统文化中的人际关系有五伦，君臣、父子、夫妻、朋友、长幼。五伦的文化中，各有自己的道德准则，父子有亲，君臣有义，夫妇有别，长幼有序，朋友有信。五伦基本讲的是熟人之间的关系，所以中国的文化是人情文化。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between the government and citizens (“ruler and subjects”): the government must effectively and intelligently protect the safety of the people and their property, this being the equivalent of the obligation in the olden days of rulers to be “competent rulers”, while the citizens must pay taxes to the government, obey the government’s laws, serve with loyalty and the utmost diligence when recruited or conscripted by by the government, and when appropriate give opinions to the government or try to dissuade the government, these being the equivalent of the obligation in the olden days of subjects to be loyal;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between parents and offspring: parents must raise and educate the offspring, while the offspring must carry out xiao (“be good to parents”) and support and care for aged, weak parents;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between husband and wife: both must be of one heart and mind, and help each other to together build a family life where both the next generation is raised and the previous generation is cared for;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among siblings: older siblings must be kind and helpful to the younger ones, the younger siblings must be respectful to the older ones, and all siblings must help each other;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among friends: friends must help each other, especially with mutual encouragement, mutual advice, and dissuasion from what is wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lu sees a much needed amendment to these five types of relationships as China enters the modern age — a defined way to treat strangers. He believes that by only having these five types of relationships, Chinese society became too much of a GuanXi-oriented society, where &lt;strong&gt;GuanXi&lt;/strong&gt; is often considered above the law. To Lu, rule of law is what defines that relationship among strangers in a shared society with shared ethics, and is crucial to its social order and stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;更严重的是，缺乏陌生人之间的道德准则，是导致商业诚信缺失的重要原因之一，而诚信恰是自由市场经济的润滑剂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More seriously, the lack of ethical standards among strangers is one of the important reasons for the lack of business integrity, and integrity is the lubricant of a free market economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can sum up the idea of value investing into the following four points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mr. Market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock as a piece of a business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin of safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circle of competence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three can be traced back to Ben Graham’s book The Intelligent Investor, the last one was added by his disciples Buffett and Munger. These concepts are so comprehendible that unfortunately, they are often substantially overlooked when people first started investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just that the absence of an objectively sound evaluation system makes the stock market seem to me awfully like a fertile ground for costly, misleading information if not outright fraud. This is where the value of value investors come in, Li argues. With the right tools and intention on their side, value investors are the true price setters of the market and the only reason why the stock exchange around the world are more than a casino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, as Li puts it, that’s what the stock market is there for: to get everyday people’s savings into the right hands in order to raise capital for promising businesses, generate wealth for stakeholders, and invigorate the economy. They search for worthwhile companies like a treasure hunter, and learn about anything related or unrelated to their targets along the way. In Li Lu’s words, ideally a value investor is more of researcher than an investor. Once they confirm their “kill”, sometimes after decades of studying and contemplating, they pull the trigger with unflinching conviction and hold it for a long time. “That’s how I sleep tight at night unlike some of my colleagues”, he reckons. As cool as it may sound, I can’t help but notice the “conscientious bankers” never made it in Hollywood. Too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;mr-market-analogy&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mr-market-analogy&quot; aria-label=&quot;mr market analogy permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mr. Market Analogy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mr. Market analogy is meant to teach us how to differentiate investing and speculating. One can think of the Mr. Market as someone who is extreme, moody, and without much thoughts. The first thing he does every morning is to shout out the latest prices. He does this continuously throughout the day. When he’s optimistic about the future, he acts like an excited auctioneer and frequently adds more to the prices; when he’s depressed, he drastically lowers the prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see Mr Market is a very irrational person. The market operates very much on the two extremes of the spectrum, continuously swinging from peaks to valleys and back again. Most people choose the path of speculation and call themselves traders. It’s the most obvious path, a path that can provide quick riches and fast cash. Most traders attempt to time the market, believing that they are a lot smarter and have a lot more insight than the rest of the traders. Some get lucky and make a lot of money in a short period of time. They feel validated, feeding into their own self-fulfilling prophecy, and believing that they are indeed gods of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value investing fundamentally discourages speculation, and the reasons are simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One can think of market index (ie total stock market index) as a zero sum game, where its value is equivalent to the sum of all investments from both investors and speculators. If the index rises at the same rate as the output from all investors, then the total output of speculators must be 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculators cannot have long term performance due to the point above. If they do better in the short term, what they are doing can be seen as some form of legalized front-running or the murky area of information exploitation or insider information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is also a good judge of character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;市场是一个发现人性弱点的机制，在金融危机到来时尤其如此。只有对知识完全诚实，才可能在市场中生存、发展、壮大。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The market is a mechanism for discovering human weaknesses, especially when the financial crisis comes. Only by being completely honest with knowledge can we survive, develop and grow in the market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;stock-as-a-piece-of-the-business&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#stock-as-a-piece-of-the-business&quot; aria-label=&quot;stock as a piece of the business permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stock as a Piece of the Business&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham, Buffett, Munger, and Lu love the idea of being an owner of the businesses they invest in, as oppose to a trader (temporary holder). This ownership mentality is important for investors because it urges them to learn more about the business. Naseeb Talib talked about a similar concept in his book &lt;strong&gt;Skin in the Game&lt;/strong&gt;. When an investor sees him/herself as an owner, the risk/reward ratio gets closer to 1 and becomes more balanced. This shift in mentality can also turn the investor into a helper of the business (time in addition to money) and a constructive critic when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;margin-of-safety&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#margin-of-safety&quot; aria-label=&quot;margin of safety permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Margin of safety&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin of safety refers to the built-in cushion for downside risk in an investment. As we have established with the Mr. Market analogy above, the market is irrational and can stay irrational much longer than most think. Leaving a big gap between what you pay and what you believe to be the intrinsic value, is therefore recommended in order to stay solvent during the treacherous waves of the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;circle-of-competence&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#circle-of-competence&quot; aria-label=&quot;circle of competence permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Circle of Competence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle of competence literally means finding the limit to one’s knowledge and ability. Value investors tend to believe that the act of investing should be a reflection of one’s knowledge/wisdom. Hence, the most difficult thing for value investors is to figure out their own limitations and set up boundaries. These boundaries are meant to discipline themselves, so they do not get distracted by the “greener pastures” outside of their circle of competence. The two main questions we should always ask ourselves are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where’s my knowledge border? What area/field of study/industry in which I am truly an expert?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I know that I’m actually competent in this area? How do I know if/when I have achieved true mastery?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very tough questions to answer. When the market moves against you and everyone else is making money while you feel like the only loser in town, how do you maintain your conviction and know that you made the correct bet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu thinks that when searching for your circle of competence, you have to find the smartest person who has the opposing view and be your devil’s advocate. If you are able to convince the other person, then you are closer to the truth and competency. You have to welcome criticism, build a team of people who have opposing views, who can challenge you on your ideas. After all these efforts, when you’ve convinced all the smart people you can find that your idea is superior, it’s still possible that there are blindspots. You will have to spend a lot of time to perfect your logic and knowledge, to be able to better understand the world and predict. Lu encourages investors to think like an economist, a sociologist, and a psychologist — in other words, think broadly and deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the us index market data (1802-1870 -&gt; 6.7%, 1871 - 1925 -&gt; 6.6%, 2000-2012, -0.1%),  even in a prosperous market such as the United States for a long time, the index has performed very poorly in two time periods, and both lasted for more than 10 years, namely 1966-1981 and 2000-2012. Time period, no profit. If someone is unfortunate enough to just put their money in index investing during these two time periods, that’s pretty bad. 10 years is not a short time for a person’s life. If we have not made any profit in the stock market for such a long period of time, our belief basically does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the answer to this question varies from person to person, and if you’re comfortable with the status quo, or self-aware, it’s not bad to accept the returns of the index. But if you want to take it to the next level, learn how to pick stocks and make trading decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value investors are loners who stick to independent thoughts and opinions&lt;/strong&gt;. People who pay less attention to popular trends and opinions are usually better value investors. Lu believes that investors’ circle of competence rarely overlap, so it’s unnecessary to over-communicate. Since value investors aren’t believers in diversification, they would not need to invest in too many ventures. Also, the less time we spend talking with others about the new hot thing, the more time we have to figure out the couple of companies we are researching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value investors are rational and objective&lt;/strong&gt;. People who are less affected by emotions are usually better value investors. There are countless books and articles warning beginner investors about their emotions, leading them to buy and sell at the exact wrong time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value investors are patient&lt;/strong&gt;. Extremely patient. Berkshire is the perfect example of this, where they are willing to sit on a pile of cash for years or decades when they believe that there’s no attractive deals on the market within their circle of competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value investors are also decisive&lt;/strong&gt;. Decisiveness (quickness in action) is often seen as a characteristic that contradicts patience (slowness in action). However, a good value investor must possess both qualities. He or she must be willing to wait for as long as necessary (years) without making a move, but pounce on an opportunity boldly with big wagers when it presents itself (usually during bear market).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value investors are passionate&lt;/strong&gt;. Passion for learning is arguably the most important thing to a fulfilled life. As an investor, having passion for all aspects of business is certainly important as well. Charlie Munger often credits his success and longevity to his interest in money sense — his passion for business in general. He often says that a good investor must also be a good businessman. He or she needs to have a grasp on and curiosity in a business’ operations. This interest will largely guide research in questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes a company successful? Why does it make money?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would the future look like for an industry? What’s its competitive landscape?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research questions usually yield no quick answers. Investment can be seen as a prediction of the future, and the future cannot be predicted most of the time. Therefore, researching for a future prediction is an activity with such low probability of success that one must be content with not finding any answers. Having low expectations, having a scientist’s mindset, and having a healthy relationship with failure and uncertainty are crucial for value investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large part of a value investors’ time should be spent reading. Readings should consist of everything and anything, but especially history, business history, and a lot of a company’s annual reports over the years. Munger is famous for being a biography nut. Buffett is known for spending 80% of his waking hours reading. By doing vast amount of reading, research, and analysis, one will have many past predictions formulate in their brain. This type of practice creates a particular smell for good investment that will become second nature for good value investors, helping them make more educated predictions in the future.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you realize that you’ve made a mistake with your evaluation of the company through your research, sell immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you see a better opportunity with better bang for a buck, aka when the opportunity cost is becoming too high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuation becomes too drastic, significantly derailing from the intrinsic value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value should not be a number, but a range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three characteristics of short selling that people may overlook:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theoretically, a stock can lose 100% of its value, yet the percentage of increase can be infinite. If you short a stock, you have to understand the asymmetric risk you are taking on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best time to short a stock is usually when a company experiences some type of crisis. It can come in the form of a discovery of accounting fraud, insolvency, or otherwise. Oftentimes, fraud can exist for a long time for a company while the market continues to carry the stock forward, and since one must pay interest to short sell, the pressure of short squeeze may bankrupt an investment before the company goes under.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short selling exerts exuberant amount of pressure and occupies all mental capacity of an investor. Lu believes that the confusion and lack of mental clarity short selling creates is actually its deadliest sin. An investor often discount the opportunity cost of the disruption of concentration and sharpness that he/she should always possess. Lu believes that he lost many great investment opportunities during his time of being a short seller because of it.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;真知灼见和频繁交易是互不相容的。这是我最大的错误&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insight and frequent transactions are incompatible with each other. This is my biggest mistake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low interest rate environments are historically rare. However, it is even rarer when all major countries around the world are doing the same QE / low interest rate / central bank interference. If one sees low interest rate as some sort of “discount rate”, then one may be wrong about his/her assessment of their “margin of safety”. The low interest rate environment 1) is usually temporary 2) should be seen as a warning sign, as it does not prevent the economy going further south. In this environment, one should set their margin of safety requirement to be a lot higher, not lower.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a company’s infancy, or during a phase of transition, management is key when it comes to evaluating a company. During a time of normalcy, management hold relatively less importance in the value of a mature company. In china, most companies are still in its infancy, thus it’s more important to consider management as a part of the process of valuation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people start to talk about cycles, they stop being value investors. Nobody who is intellectually honest can predict cycles. When you get into the business of predicting cycles, you will find that besides longer cycles of bubbles, there are infinitely smaller cycles, down to weeks, and days. People fall into the trap of wasting more time chasing cycles than doing actual homework.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between the government and citizens (“ruler and subjects”): the government must effectively and intelligently protect the safety of the people and their property, this being the equivalent of the obligation in the olden days of rulers to be “competent rulers”, while the citizens must pay taxes to the government, obey the government’s laws, serve with loyalty and the utmost diligence when recruited or conscripted by by the government, and when appropriate give opinions to the government or try to dissuade the government, these being the equivalent of the obligation in the olden days of subjects to be loyal;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between parents and offspring: parents must raise and educate the offspring, while the offspring must carry out xiao (“be good to parents”) and support and care for aged, weak parents;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between husband and wife: both must be of one heart and mind, and help each other to together build a family life where both the next generation is raised and the previous generation is cared for;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among siblings: older siblings must be kind and helpful to the younger ones, the younger siblings must be respectful to the older ones, and all siblings must help each other;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among friends: friends must help each other, especially with mutual encouragement, mutual advice, and dissuasion from what is wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More seriously, the lack of ethical standards among strangers is one of the important reasons for the lack of business integrity, and integrity is the lubricant of a free market economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides of our brains are different. The left side likes lists, sequences, logic, language, details, rules, and order. The right side pays attention to nonverbal signals, emotions, images, personal memories, music, art, creativity, and is more connected to the lower brain area that receives, understands, and processes emotional information. The two sides are connected by a bundle of fibers because we need them to work together, to be integrated. Young kids, however, are mostly operating from their right brains because they haven’t developed the abilities to use logic, understand time, use words to express feelings, etc. It’s our role to help them use both sides of their brains. Two strategies will help for kids of any age:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How A Child’s Brain Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the brain’s integration process is valuable, and can be broken down into five different types. There’s left and right brain integration, vertical and horizontal integration, memory integration, integrating the different parts of self, and finally, integrating self and other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is enormously complex with different areas performing various tasks, yet constantly interlinking. For example, the “reptilian” part of the brain makes split-second survival choices, and the ‘mammalian’ part is more concerned with relationships. Good mental health means getting all areas of the brain to work well together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To “work well together” means all the parts are integrating effectively. Horizontal integration is when the left-brain and right-brain link together. Vertical integration involves the intuitive, more primitive parts of the brain, allowing the more reasonable prefrontal cortex to pause and re-consider a little. Memory integration helps the hippocampus make implicit memories more explicit so that we can process worrying things that have occurred in the past. We can also integrate different thoughts and experiences by focusing our attention differently. And finally, we can develop our kids’ built-in capacity for social connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Connect with the Right: When kids are experiencing big emotions, they’re operating from their right brain. Logic, language, telling them it isn’t so bad, trying to distract them – none of these strategies will work because they’re left-brain strategies. Instead, use your right brain to connect, to tune in to their emotions, to resonate with your child – acknowledge their feelings. Then and only then –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Redirect with the Left: Use simple logic and language to suggest solutions to their problems. The authors caution that this does not mean permissiveness, that it takes practice to get good at this strategy, and that you have to maintain your own calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, connect with your child using a right-brain comment. Katie’s dad acknowledged that she felt sick, and said, ‘And I know that didn’t feel good, did it?’ Only then did he put the story together for Katie, using more logical details. Performing a right-brain to right-brain connection first is known as attunement. Attunement acknowledges feelings using empathetic facial expressions, a compassionate tone of voice, and nonjudgmental listening. It allows our children to ‘feel felt,’ creating a safe space to then address the situation or problem more logically. Once the brain is in a more integrated state, it’s easier to manage the left brain, and solve an issue. It doesn’t mean giving up on boundaries and discipline, nor does it mean solving problems immediately. It just reduces the emotional overload, allowing you to connect and then redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too often we “dismiss and deny” the emotional importance of life’s difficult experiences: we try to talk kids out of their feelings, or we avoid painful issues. Instead, pick a time when you and your child are feeling calm, and have a story-telling conversation about the difficult event. This strategy is integrating both sides of the brain – the left tells the story of the right brain’s strong emotion: taming by naming.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want our children to balance logic and emotions, confront their difficulties, and grow from experiences. When raw emotions do not have the left brain logic to help them, like the emotions Katie was battling with, the bank of chaos looms. On the other hand, if they deny their feelings, the shift is towards the bank of rigidity. We can help our children to build the imaginary staircase between the two levels of the brain, reminding ourselves that a child’s brain is always a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the brain as a two-story house. The downstairs brain develops early and is responsible for bodily functions like breathing, as well as for strong emotional reactions like fight (anger), flight (fear), and freeze (fear). There’s a small structure in the downstairs brain that the authors call the “baby gate” of the mind – it causes us to react emotionally without thinking. Sometimes this is good, especially when we feel passionate about someone or thing; often it gets us into trouble (when we react instead of respond to experiences that aren’t life-threatening). The upstairs brain (the top part of your cortex, especially the area behind your forehead) develops later in childhood and on into adulthood; it’s the place where mental processes happen – good decisions, self understanding, emotional and bodily control, empathy, a sense of right and wrong, etc. All the actions we hope kids will take require the upstairs brain, which isn’t fully on-line yet, but we can still appeal to it using the following strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First make sure you have applied step 1 of Strategy 1 and connect. Then, once calm, help them find solutions to their challenges. Engage their upstairs brain in problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have to ask ourselves which side of the brain we want to appeal to. If tension is building, it may help to engage the upstairs brain instead of trying to halt the rage brewing in the downstairs brain. So when you can see that your child is about to lose it, you can ask for more precise words for how they feel, and then maybe ask them to come up with a compromise that works for everybody, or start negotiating&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A strong upstairs brain balances out the downstairs brain, and is essential for social-emotional intelligence.” So throughout the day look for opportunities to help your child practice upstairs brain skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making decisions&lt;/strong&gt;: For toddlers, give choices about what to wear, what to drink, etc. For older kids, let them, with support and guidance, make more difficult choices about conflicting schedules or desires. Don’t rescue them, even if you can foresee that their choice might lead to their regret. However, help them predict possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulating emotions and the body&lt;/strong&gt;: Be sure and model this yourself in all your interactions with your kids. Teach them calming techniques like taking a deep breath (“Swallow a bubble,” “Take a belly breath.”). Older kids can learn to count to ten, or take a mental time-out. Self-understanding: Ask kids questions that help them think about and reflect on their feelings, help them predict what they might feel in a new situation &amp;#x26; how they might handle it. Also, model this for them by using self-talk out loud, “Hmmm. I seem to feel extra nervous. I wonder why? Maybe it’s because I don’t know what my boss will say when I ask for time off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy&lt;/strong&gt;: Ask kids questions about the feelings of others, about what someone’s actions might suggest about how they feel, about what might make someone feel better, etc. Show compassion and empathy yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morality&lt;/strong&gt;: This isn’t just knowing what’s right and wrong but understanding how actions impact the greater good. We want our kids to do the right thing with compassion, kindness, and empathy – not because someone’s watching, but because they know right from wrong. The authors give examples of questions and situations to develop this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;third-aspect-of-integration-involves-memory&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#third-aspect-of-integration-involves-memory&quot; aria-label=&quot;third aspect of integration involves memory permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Third aspect of integration involves memory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories aren’t like photocopy machines that produce accurate pictures of what took place in the past. The hippocampus stores memory with an overlay of emotion, and our memories always coexist with the feelings we attach to an event. Memory also isn’t like a filing cabinet, where we simply pull them out when we need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children associate past experiences with what might happen in the future. They then react accordingly. Once an implicit memory is spoken about and understood, it becomes explicit and, therefore, easier to deal with any fears they may have. Children don’t just forget about difficult experiences; we have to help them understand what happened, and how they felt about it. Then, just like a jigsaw puzzle, put all the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movement changes brain chemistry, so when kids are near a breaking point and aren’t connecting with their upstairs brain, get them moving to integrate their brain. The same is true for adults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Integrating Memory for Growth and Healing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memories are tricky because they’re not just experiences filed away in a file cabinet, exactly as they happened. And they’re not exact photocopies of the experience, either. In this chapter you’ll learn about two different kinds of memory, and how to help your kids (and yourself) integrate them. If we don’t help our kids integrate their difficult memories, their emotions will show up in their behavior – which can confuse both them and us. And it’s important to remember that what’s a challenging memory for a child might seem pretty harmless to us. The authors use cute cartoon drawings and catchy sayings to illustrate the strategies:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as telling a “story” or narrative about a strong emotion is naming it to tame it, here we help kids get in touch with their unhappy and challenging memories to integrate them. The authors suggest we guide kids to think of their minds as a remote control that can fast-forward, skip, pause, and stop when remembering painful experiences. As adults, we should help them “rewind and remember” instead of “fast-forward and forget.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make daily family conversations a habit so kids always have a chance to talk about their experiences and memories. Ask open-ended questions that will get them thinking and encourage them to share more than a “yes” or “no.” Instead of the usual, “How was your day?” ask them questions like, “What was your favorite part of the day?” and “Tell me about recess.” Ask them about their not-so favorite parts of the day, too. Print those digital photos and make books and albums for your kids so you can talk about shared experiences together. Have a regular family movie night where you watch movies you’ve made of your kids, family, and experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chapter the authors introduce the idea of “Mindsight,” a term coined by Dan Siegel that mean understanding our own minds, which then we can then use to understand the minds of others. In this chapter you’ll read how to teach kids about the wheel of awareness, telling the difference between what they feel and who they are, learn to focus their attention, and learn to get back to their hub (center). This will help them develop Mindsight. Most of these concepts are for K-12 kids, but you yourself will benefit from applying them to your own mind. By modeling this for younger kids, you’ll be preparing them to use Mindsight as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help children to integrate their memories, feelings, and thoughts in order to understand their minds. When they learn that they have some choice about how they feel or respond to situations, it’s very empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching kids to get in touch with and verbalize their feelings is a good strategy. But it’s also important to teach them that feelings are temporary and changeable, like the weather. This helps them put feelings in perspective – they won’t last forever. This will help them regain a calm state more easily and maintain it when painful feelings come along.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teach kids to know what’s on the rim of their wheel of awareness and focus their attention on the following: the Sensations (messages) their body sends them; the Images they have from their experiences and imagination (from the right brain); the Feelings they have (right brain); and the Thoughts they are using to understand their world (left brain). This process is the basis for Mindsight and the chapter has strategies to make it fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIFT is the acronym for sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts. We can use this acronym to help children sort through physical sensations such as butterflies in the tummy, images that might be worrying them, such as an embarrassing moment at school, and feelings. It helps if they have a broad “feeling” vocabulary, so they can use specific words like “disappointed,” as opposed to a more general one like feeling “sad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children can also learn that they don’t have to believe all their thoughts. We can encourage them to argue with the ones that may not be true. And we can teach them strategies that calm them, like visualization techniques or imagining a place where they feel calm and peaceful. If they can access a sense of stillness and calm, they can learn to separate from and manage the storms that brew around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By teaching kids that they can choose how to think and feel about what happens to them in life, that they aren’t victims, that they can use their mind to calm their brain, they’ll thrive. The authors present ways to help kids get in touch with their “hub,” that peaceful, calm center.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to help kids develop the second aspect of Mindsight – to integrate self and other – and develop relationships based on kindness, compassion, and empathy. Using the Mindsight skills they’re learning, with help from you and the developmental process, they can now learn to combine insight with empathy to develop interpersonal integration. It’s up to adults to create positive relationships with kids; to encourage them to make friends and form relationships by helping them be receptive instead of reactive, and to use Mindsight skills with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes children need a little bit of help with their empathy and to recognize others’ needs and perspectives. Enter the fascinating discovery of mirror neurons. Our brains are activated to respond to the actions of somebody else. We can nurture this built-in wiring in our children to create more empathy. For example, if we see someone in tears, we often become tearful too. Our bodies automatically respond to someone else’s emotions and actions. We mirror them. Hence, our kids can learn to empathize with others, without losing their sense of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend time having fun, playing, and enjoying each other’s company. Every time you have enjoyable experiences with kids, their brains release a “reward” chemical called dopamine, and they learn that relationships are rewarding. You’ve probably tried some of the suggestions to implement this strategy – and if you haven’t, the time to start is now!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict is unavoidable in relationships, so teach kids how to handle it in helpful ways using Mindsight: 1. recognize others’ perspectives and viewpoints (teach them previous strategies); 2. teach them to understand nonverbal cues so they can attune with others; 3. teach them to repair the relationship after conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our children argue or complain about something someone said to them, we can ask them to explore the other person’s perspective. They can look at why they thought this person responded differently, and explore another’s reactions without being defensive. They can observe someone’s non-verbal behavior to understand what emotions they might have. We can also teach them to fix things after a fight by discussing how they can make amends. This could be through a kind act, or a letter of apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Graham knew that stocks typically look most attractive at the top of their business cycle (the worst risk-reward ratio) and least attractive at the bottom (the best risk-reward ratio).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Icahn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ichan started in convertible arbitrage, moved into closed-end mutual fund arbitrage, and eventually to activist investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He outlined the transition to an activist investor in a 1976 memo “Icahn Manifesto.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal was to motivate management to act in the shareholder’s best interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible outcomes produce profits: liquidation or sale to another company, making a tender offer, proxy fight, or selling stock back to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Graham was an early activist who saw firsthand how often management ran a business for themselves and at the expense of shareholders. Most shareholders never questioned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham’s NCAV was a conservative estimate of liquidation value (a worst-case scenario) for a stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin of Safety: protects from permanent loss and provides an opportunity for gain as price rises closer to value. The wider the spread between price and value the wider the margin of safety (lower the risk) and the higher the possibility for gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing Graham’s NCAV strategy: NCAV stocks were divided into stocks that were profitable in the prior year and stocks operating at a loss. The portfolio of stocks operating at a loss outperformed the profitable stocks. And the profitable-dividend paying stocks earned a lower return than non-dividend payers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCAV strategy is very limited — usually, very small companies and the opportunities only appear in a bear market and disappear entirely in long bull markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth Klarman looks for catalysts to reduce risk and generate returns because catalysts reduce the impact market fluctuations might have on a stock’s price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Munger believed some companies were worth paying a premium for: “The trick is to get more quality than you pay for in price. It’s just that simple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See’s Candies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett paid $25 million for the company in 1972.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1971, See’s earned $5 million pre-tax on $8 million in tangible assets; a 60% return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10% to 12% discount rate put the value of See’s between $40 and $48 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett called See’s the “prototype of a dream business.” It requires very little capital to operate the business and generates a huge return on capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 2007 BRK letter, Buffett explained why: from 1972 to 2007 earnings grew 16-fold while invested capital grew 5-fold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Greenblatt’s “Magic Formula” ranks stocks based on quality and value using: return on capital and earnings yield where earnings yield = EBIT/EV. From 1974 to 2011, the Magic Formula earned a 13.94% annual return versus the S&amp;#x26;P 500’s 10.37%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Yield (EBIT/EV) alone earned 15.95% annually from 1974 to 2011, beating the market and Greenblatt’s Magic Formula. Return on capital alone underperformed the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low valuation ratio is more likely to identify an undervalued stock than a high valuation ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1964 to 2011: EBITDA/EV, EBIT/EV, P/E, EV/FCF, EV/Gross Profit, P/B outperformed the S&amp;#x26;P 500 (total return). The top three metrics were EBIT/EV, EBITDA/EV, and EV/Gross Profit, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EV = market cap plus debt and preferred stock minus cash. It’s a closer measure of a company’s true cost to an acquirer because an acquirer assumes all the liabilities but gains cash and equivalents after a takeover. Market cap can be misleading, especially for highly levered or cash-heavy companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should be thinking in similar terms as an acquirer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean Reversion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few businesses produce persistently high returns on capital but most don’t. Predicting which businesses do is not easily measurable via quantitative factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most businesses that earn high returns on capital eventually see those returns revert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High returns on invested capital attract competition and investment that eventually lowers returns across the industry. In the rare cases where high returns persist, it’s larger due to protection from competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk of ignoring the possibility of mean reversion is overly-optimistic valuations that lead to losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;De Bondt and Thaler tested two portfolios of stocks: the 35 extreme winners against the 35 extreme losers from 1926 to 1982 and found the losers beat the winners. They theorized the performance was due to investors overreacting to news — too pessimistic or optimistic — in the short term. In a second study, they tested mean reversion in earnings — earnings of stocks in the loser portfolio grew faster than in the winner portfolio (the winners saw earnings decrease).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dimson, Marsh, &amp;#x26; Staunton found an inverse relationship between investment returns and GDP growth per capita. In a second study, country’s with economies with the lowest growth rate produced the highest stock market returns. Investors see high growth in an economy, become optimistic, and bid stock prices too high. The opposite happens with low growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lakonishok found that value stocks beat glamour stocks because “naive” strategies failed to account for mean reversion. The authors replicated Lakonishok’s study in 23 developed countries and found similar results — value outperformers glamour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The characteristics behind mean reversion in markets is behavioral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kahneman &amp;#x26; Tversky found that people make decisions based on three heuristics — representativeness, availability, and anchoring/adjusting — that lead to mistakes. It causes people to ignore the probabilities of future events when making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three variables in discounted cash flow models — future cash flows, growth rate, and discount rate — are potential sources of error. Being wrong on one can throw the entire model off. Minor changes in the discount rate have the biggest impact. More importantly, the model creates the impression that accurately predicting future cash flows and growth is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contrarian investor should anticipate mean reversion in fundamentals and valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrarian Value Portfolio versus Glamour Portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrarian Value portfolio held stocks with the lowest sales growth and lowest P/B, P/CF, and earnings multiple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glamour portfolio held stocks with the highest sales growth and highest P/B, P/CF, and earnings multiple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study was run from 1963 to 1990.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrarian Value significantly outperformed Glamour over 5 year periods with a cumulative return ranging from 77% to 104% depending on the valuation multiple used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to selection in the portfolio, glamour showed the highest growth in earnings, cash flow, sales, and operating earnings and contrarian value showed the lowest growth in earnings, cash flow, sales, and operating earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrarian Value versus High-Growth Value
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up similarly to prior study but with the value decile split between high and low growth (contrarian) earning, cash flow, sales, and operating earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrarian  Value significantly outperformed High Growth Value (high growth value outperformed glamour).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two takeaways: value may be more important than growth and low/no growth leads to outperformance while high growth leads to underperformance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golden Rule of Predictive Modeling: simple models often make as/more reliable predictions than experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies on activist campaigns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activist campaigns against companies produce both short and long-term outperformance in the stock’s price versus the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Campaigns specific to seeking the sale of the company or a spinoff of assets produced the highest excess returns, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activist campaigns also outperform a basket of cheap stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more hostile or aggressive campaigns earned a higher return, on average, than friendlier campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies hit by activist campaigns show an improvement in fundamentals — improved margins, ROA, ROE, payout ratio, and lowered executive pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The typical activist target was undervalued, with high cash flows but low payouts, large cash holdings compared to other assets, and poor growth prospects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typical activist’s primary objective was to fix one of these categories: undervaluation, operational efficiency, low payout and overcapitalization, excessive diversification, independence, poor governance, and undercapitalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basket of the cheapest of the cheap value stocks outperformed all. The cheapest EBIT/EV decile, split between Deep Value (lowest value) and Glamour (highest value), and versus the entire decile, Deep Value beat all from 1951 to 2013. And equal-weighted Deep Value outperformed market-cap-weighted Deep Value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This book is an investigation of the evidence, and the conditions under which losing stocks become asymmetric opportunities, with limited downside and enormous upside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors aren’t rewarded for picking winners; they’re rewarded for uncovering mispricings — divergences between the price of a security and its intrinsic value. It is mispricings that create market-beating opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whenever a fight for control is initiated, it generally leads to windfall profits for shareholders. Often the target company, if seriously threatened, will seek another, more friendly enterprise, generally known as a ‘white knight’ to make a higher bid, thereby starting a bidding war. Another gambit occasionally used by the target company is to attempt to purchase the acquirers’ stock or, if all else fails, the target may offer to liquidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly enough, although I consider myself to be primarily in the quantitative school…the really sensational ideas I have had over the years have been heavily weighted toward the qualitative side where I have had a “high-probability insight.” This is what causes the cash register to sing. However, it is an infrequent occurrence, as insights usually are, and, of course, no insight is required on the quantitative side—the figures should hit you over the head with a baseball bat.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The data suggest that the better bet is fair companies at wonderful prices. The why of it reveals two truths about value investment: First, Greenblatt’s earnings yield is a very good metric for identifying undervalued stocks, and, second, mean reversion is a powerful phenomenon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Abnormally good or abnormally bad conditions do not last forever. This is true of general business but of particular industries as well. Corrective forces are usually set in motion which tend to restore profits where they have disappeared, or to reduce them where they are excessive in relation to capital.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is impossible to infer the cause of persistence in performance from the fact that persistence occurs. Persistence may be due to fixed resources, consistent industry structure, financial anomalies, price controls, or many other factors that endure… In sum, reliable inferences about the cause of persistence cannot be generated from an analysis that only documents whether or not persistence occurred.” — Michael Porter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here is the simple truth: mean reversion is pervasive, and it works on financial results as it does on stock prices. On average, super-normal returns on capital revert to the mean. Only special cases avoid mean reversion, and the factors that separate the also-rans from the special cases are impossible to identify prospectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A company with great fundamental performance may earn a market rate of return if the stock price already reflects the fundamentals. You don’t get paid for picking winners; you get paid for unearthing mispricings. Failure to distinguish between fundamentals and expectations is common in the investment business.” — Michael Mauboussin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mean reversion in the markets looks a lot more like the gambler’s fallacy made real — movements in security prices, individually and in aggregate, tend to be followed by subsequent price movements in the opposite direction. The more extreme the initial price movement, the greater will be the subsequent adjustment in the opposite direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Graham’s deeper lesson was that value oscillates, too. We err when we examine a stock’s financial statements to analyze its fundamental performance and assume that the trend will persist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny’s findings suggest that a contrarian strategy—one that actively seeks out undervalued companies with poor historical performance—will outperform overvalued companies with excellent historical performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the High-Growth Value and Contrarian Value portfolios contained stocks trading on approximately the same price-to-value ratios, the stocks in the High-Growth Value portfolios were in some instances cheaper than the stocks in the Contrarian Value portfolios and yet the Contrarian Value portfolios delivered comprehensively better returns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is clear is that value investing in general, and deep value investing in particular, is exceedingly behaviorally difficult. It is counterintuitive and against instinct, which is why many investors shy away from it. To succeed as deep value investors, we need to overcome our behavioral biases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any investment strategy that is based upon buying well-run, good companies and expecting the growth in earnings in these companies to carry prices higher is dangerous, since it ignores the possibility that the current price of the company already reflects the quality of the management and the firm. If the current price is right (and the market is paying a premium for quality), the biggest danger is that the firm loses its luster over time, and that the premium paid will dissipate. If the market is exaggerating the value of the firm, this strategy can lead to poor returns even if the firm delivers its expected growth. It is only when markets under estimate the value of firm quality that this strategy stands a chance of making excess returns.” — Aswath Damodaran&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the long haul, the market reflects management’s ability to make the most out of its assets. So the price of a company’s stock is like a report card… A going concern should sell for at least the value of its assets, and something more if it has good management. If a company has poor management, the price of the stock will suffer, usually selling substantially below the appraised value.” — T. Boone Pickens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where the company is not appropriately capitalized, where it is not minimizing its cost of capital, intrinsic value can be improved by reducing excess cash. In so doing, the market price discount is also likely to be removed, and the company trade closer to its fully realized intrinsic value. The utility of the enterprise multiple is that it identifies precisely this type of company, undervalued with an unexploited intrinsic value. If no activist emerges to improve the unexploited intrinsic value, other corrective forces act on the market price to generate excellent returns in the meantime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The research shows, first, that valuation is more important than the trend in earnings. Cheap, low, or no-growth portfolios systematically outperform expensive, high-growth portfolios, and by wide margins. The second, more counterintuitive finding of the research is that, even in the value portfolios, high growth leads to underperformance, and low or no growth leads to outperformance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide digs into the growing factor zoo to find the factor premia worth considering in a portfolio. The authors introduce five criteria any factor should meet, discuss the seven factors that qualify, and why other factors fall short of consideration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data mining often finds false factors that result from randomness. Data mining has created a growing “factor zoo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always a risk that a factor has been arbitraged out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities and timberland are the only two alternative investments with no correlation to stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factor diversification is a more effective diversifier than asset class diversification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factor Investability Test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent – factor delivers historically reliable returns across time and economic regimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pervasive – factor delivers returns across different asset classes, sectors, and countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robust – factor delivers returns across various metrics versus only one metric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intuitive – factor makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investable – factor delivers returns not only on paper but in reality, after fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To earn the premium of any factor investors must accept the risk of long periods where the premium is negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Beta Premium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beta is the amount an asset moves relative to the market or the correlation between the asset’s returns and the market’s returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market beta premium in the U.S. is 8.3% (1927 to 2015). It’s the excess returns stocks earn over T-bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been positive in almost every country since 1900, ranging from 3.1% to 6.3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Size Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size Premium – small-cap returns minus large cap returns or small minus big (SMB). Small and large caps are divided by deciles. Small is deciles 6 to 10. Large is deciles 1 to 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size Premium in the U.S. is 3.3% (1927 to 2015).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also persists in developed (ex-US) and emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the size premium is constructed using the smallest 30% versus the largest 30%, the premium increases. As the definition of small vs. large is narrowed (i.e. smallest 20%, 10%, etc.), the premium increases further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small Companies typically carry: more leverage, smaller capital base, more volatile earnings, lower profitability, uncertain cash flows, less liquidity, unproven track record, unproven management, more volatile stock prices, and investors favor stocks with potential lottery-like returns. All are possible risks that explain the premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monetary policy affects the size premium. The premium shows up during periods of expansionary policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size premium varies across the economic cycle. Small companies grow faster than large companies during economic upturns but do worse during downturns. Small caps produce low returns during recessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small Cap Growth is the exception, underperforming the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size works better with other factors: value, momentum, quality, and low-beta all showed improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value Premium – value stock returns minus growth stock returns or high minus low (HML). Growth is defined as the 30% of stocks with the highest book-to-market ratio. Value is the 30% of stocks with the lowest book-to-market ratio. Book-to-market is the common metric used by academics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists across developed and emerging countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns were higher in value stocks that had cut dividends by 25% or more, high debt-to-equity ratio, and high earnings volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk-based explanations: value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks during falling interest rates, increases in money supply, and economic expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavioral-based explanations: investors are too optimistic of growth stock performance and too pessimistic toward value stocks or investors confuse popularity with safety, leading to growth stock becoming overvalued and value stocks being undervalued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value premium may persist beyond one year — up to three years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Momentum Premium: assets that have performed well in the recent past will continue to perform well in the future. Defined as returns over the last 12 months (excluding the most recent month) or up minus down (UMD) The most recent month is usually excluded because it tends to show a reversal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Momentum Premium in the U.S. is 9.6% (1927 to 2015).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two Types:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-Sectional Momentum: measures the relative performance of an asset versus other assets in the same asset class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time-Series Momentum: aka trend-following measures the absolute performance of an asset versus its own performance (covered below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists across asset stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and county.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s strongest in small caps, especially microcaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Momentum tends to be a high turnover strategy, which can increase trading costs. To avoid high turnover, momentum can be used to filter out assets to avoid, lowering turnover. Works well in combination with a value factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 52% of the premium comes from the long side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavioral Explanation: Investors are slow to react to new information (underreaction) and then chase returns (overreaction).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Momentum returns fall from 8.9% to 2.9% over a six-month period, for stocks with continuous information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The premium exists in other periods – 6 and 9 months, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long/Short momentum strategies experience crashes on the short side (due to quick market reversals) during periods of higher volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The way to mitigate the risk of crashes is to vary exposure to momentum over time. The authors found that if they scaled exposure to momentum (using the realized variance of the daily returns in the previous six months), the risk-managed momentum strategy achieves a higher cumulative return with less risk.” It adjusts the amount of money invested based on volatility because volatility typically rises prior to drawdowns. Less (more) money when volatility is high (low).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, diversifying across factors can lower the risk of momentum crashes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profitability &amp;#x26; Quality Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quality and Profitability factors are broad with a lot of metrics lumped into each that meet the investability test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitability Factor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross Profitability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitable companies generate higher returns than unprofitable companies, with the most profitable outperforming the least profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shows a similar predictive power as book-to-market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictor of future growth, earnings, free cash flow, and payouts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High asset turnover drives returns of profitable companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High gross margins drives returns of “good” growth stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash-based Operating Profitability (excluding accruals): Tends to outperform other profitability metrics: operating profitability, gross profitability, and net income-based profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on Equity: high ROE companies outperform low ROE companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on Invested Capital: high ROIC companies outperform low ROIC companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Profitable Premium increases during economic drawdowns because profitable companies perform better than unprofitable companies during recessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral Explanation: investors underreact to profitability news, leaving those companies undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combines well with value strategies, tends to be low turnover, and reduces volatility. Tends to perform better when value performs poorly. A value/profitability combo never experienced a losing five-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Profits/Assets, Total Profits/Sales, and FCF/Assets also show a premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality Factor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defined as quality minus junk (QMJ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combines well with value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Shares Issued: Companies that decrease net shares outperform companies that increase net shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accruals: Companies with low accruals outperform companies with high accruals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Operating Assets: “The difference on a firm’s balance sheet between all operating assets and all operating liabilities, scaled by total assets, is a strong negative predictor of long-run stock returns.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset Growth: Companies with high asset growth underperform companies with low asset growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment/Assets: Companies with high capital investment-to-assets underperform companies with low capital investment-to-assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distress: Companies with a high chance of failure underperform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on Assets: More profitable firms outperform less profitable firms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohlson O-Score: Measures risk of bankruptcy. High bankruptcy risk leads to underperformance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital Investment: Companies that increase capital investment underperform those that don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Term Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Term Premium is the long government bonds minus 1-month T-bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The premium is 2.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent globally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer maturity = higher premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carry Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry Premium is defined as higher-yielding assets outperform lower-yielding assets assuming prices do not change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ex: currencies of the highest interest rate countries outperform currencies of the lowest interest rate countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists across asset classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry trade strategies have a risk of crashes when stock markets crash. Lower interest rate currencies act as “safe havens” during global shocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combining carry and trend following produces a better return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows factor premia declined less, after publication, in stocks that are more costly to arbitrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is less evidence of factor premia decline, after publication, internationally due to arbitrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limits to Arbitrage: Why Anomalies Might Persist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions are prohibited by their charters from shorting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of shorting is too expensive and/or limited supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of shorting (unlimited loss) is too high, forced liquidation, or recalled stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading costs and taxes can also limit arbitrage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career Risk: Fund managers are unwilling to stray too far from their benchmark for fear of losing their job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking Error: the risk of underperforming a benchmark. It can lead to investors confusing strategy and outcome and abandoning a solid strategy at inopportune times. A strategy should be judged on its face before the results because outcomes are not guaranteed in investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relativism: the tendency for investors to compare their performance against a benchmark (or others), which affects their satisfaction with the strategy and their willingness to stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recency Bias: recent events have a larger impact on a person’s thoughts and decisions. It lead investors to put too much weight on recent events like performance and buy what has recently performed well while selling what has recently performed poorly — when they should be doing the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research shows that dividend yield alone does not predict future returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns of dividend strategies are better explained by exposure to other factors. For example, strategies based on companies with rising dividends are better explained by quality and profitability factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, dividends do provide psychological benefits — receiving dividends avoids regret from selling stock and the effect of loss aversion. “People suffer more regret when actions are taken than when actions are avoided. In selling stock to create the homemade dividend, a decision must be made to raise the cash. When spending comes from the dividend, no action is taken, thus less regret is felt. Again, this helps explain the preference for cash dividends.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend yield combined with net share buybacks and debt reduction does improve returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with a lower payout ratio outperform those with a higher payout ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low Volatility Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Volatility Factor is that defensive less volatile stocks outperform aggressive, high volatile stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists in developed and emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Vol factor may be better explained by profitability and size (large caps).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A combination of a highly volatile stocks and low short interest outperformed a market index by 7%. A combo of highly volatile stocks and high short interest underperformed. In fact, high volatility/low short interest outperformed during prior crashes in 2000 and 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short Interest — stocks with high short interest perform poorly on average. Stocks with high borrowing costs also predict poor returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-vol strategies are exposed to term risk — more correlated with long-term bond returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-vol strategies tend to shift exposure between growth and value regime — spending about 62% of the time in value regimes, 38% in growth regimes. Most of the outperformance can be explained by its time in the value regime as it underperforms in the growth regime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-vol factor is predictive of future low volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One way to take advantage of the low-vol factor is to screen out high volatile or high beta stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default Premium is long-term investment grade bonds minus long-term government bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source of the premium is explained by default/credit risk. However, taking additional credit risk offers an almost insignificant additional return over government bonds, historically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the return of high-yield bonds is explained by equity risk. High-yield bonds are also highly correlated with stocks, especially when stocks perform poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long term, the correlation between Treasuries and stocks is nearly 0 (uncorrelated), but that correlation varies over time. Bonds are negatively correlated when stock volatility rises. During stock market drawdowns investors flee to safe government bonds. So Treasury bonds are a strong diversifier for stocks during drawdowns. Other bonds do not carry the same diversification benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-Series Momentum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time-Series Momentum is the trend of an asset compared to its own past performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists internationally and across other asset classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not experience crashes like cross-sectional momentum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual Momentum — combines time-series and cross-sectional momentum. It buys the strongest winning portfolio and shorts the weakest losing portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trend following performs well during extreme outlier years for the stock market. “During the 10 largest drawdowns experienced by the traditional 60/40 portfolio over the past 135 years, the time-series momentum strategy experienced positive returns in eight of these stress periods and delivered significant positive returns during a number of these events.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tends to be a high turnover strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining Multiple Factors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using multiple factors is the optimal approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding an additional factor only exposes a portfolio to a small portion of the factor’s premium. The overall return will only see incremental improvement, if at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors need to weigh the trade-offs of negatively correlated factors like value and momentum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolios get a diversification benefit from factors that not perfectly correlated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports Betting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moskowitz tested the behavioral models on sports betting — baseball, football, basketball, hockey — to see if behavior drove outcomes or if markets were efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sports betting is not profitable. Returns are flat before fees and negative after fees. The only way to get a positive return is by eliminating the fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Momentum exists and predicts returns. Betters pushed up prices. The opening prices set by bookies were more correct than the prices when betting was closed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value exists and predicts returns. Cheap bets got cheaper before reversing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“First, the momentum and value effects move betting prices from the open to the close of betting. These patterns are completely reversed by the game’s outcome, and in a manner that is consistent with how these premiums work in financial markets. Second, the fact that both momentum and value have predictive value in sports betting markets, and that these factors have the same negative relationship (momentum pushes prices up and value pushes prices down) that they demonstrate in the financial markets, provides support for the idea that these factors do incorporate at least some behavioral components in financial markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All but short-maturity corporate bonds contain equity-like risks. And the lower the credit rating, the greater the contagion risk. Thus, investors who choose to include an allocation to either high-yield bonds or longer-term investment-grade bonds should consider them as hybrid instruments, combining the characteristics of both U.S. Treasuries and equities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The duration — in terms of sensitivity to interest rates — of the portfolios increases monotonically with the dividend yields. Stocks with high dividends tend to experience decreases in returns when long-term bond yields increase, while those with low dividends tend to earn higher returns when interest rates hike up.” — “Equity Duration: A Puzzle on High Dividend Stocks”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Diversification means accepting the fact that parts of your portfolio may behave entirely differently than the portfolio itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Relativity worked well for Einstein, but it has no place in investing.” – John Bogle (quoting an anonymous fund manager)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e., if history played out in a different way). Such substitute courses of events are called alternative histories. Clearly, the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome, but such a point seems to be voiced only by people who fail (those who succeed attribute their success to the quality of their decision).” — Nassim Taleb, Fooled by Randomness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, anomalies can persist even when they become well known… Second, research does appear to lead to increased cash flows from investors seeking to gain exposure to the premiums, which in turn leads to lower future realized returns. However, we note that where logical, risk-based explanations exist, premiums should never disappear… However, we do caution investors not to automatically assume that future premiums will be as large as the historical record.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“High-quality companies have the following traits: low earnings volatility, high margins, high asset turnover (indicating efficient use of assets), low financial leverage, low operating leverage (indicating a strong balance sheet and low macroeconomic risk), and low stock-specific risk (volatility that is unexplained by macroeconomic activity). Companies with these attributes historically have provided higher returns, especially in down markets. In particular, high-quality stocks that are profitable, stable, growing, and have a high payout ratio outperform low-quality stocks with the opposite characteristics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been shown that other measures of what is referred to as fundamental momentum, such as earnings momentum, changes in profit margins, and changes in analysts’ forecasts, produce premiums.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At its most basic level, factor-based investing is simply about defining and then systematically following a set of rules that produce diversified portfolios.” – Cliff Asness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Belief in the factors you choose is vital not just to make sure they are real, and not just data mining, but because without well-formed, strongly held beliefs (perhaps stemming from persistence, pervasiveness, robustness, intuition, and investability!), nobody will stick with their investing process through the inevitable tough times.” — Cliff Asness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Growth stocks are high-duration assets (much of their value comes from expected future growth), making them similar to long-term bonds. Value stocks, on the other hand, are low-duration assets, making them more similar to short-term bonds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors in glamour stocks are likely to under-react to information that contradict their beliefs about firms’ growth prospects or reflect the effects of mean reversion in performance. Similarly, value stocks, being inherently more distressed than glamour stocks, tend to be neglected by investors; as a result, performance expectations for value firms may be too pessimistic and reflect improvements in fundamentals too slowly.” — Piotroski&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The profitability premium is about 1 percent higher per month among firms with smaller capitalization, higher return volatility, higher cash flow volatility, less analyst coverage, larger analyst forecast dispersion, fewer institutional holdings, higher idiosyncratic return volatility, lower dollar trading volume, higher bid-offer spread, lower credit rating, higher illiquidity, and that are younger.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard Marks explains the pattern of cycles found in markets, the economy, and business. An investor who understands the different cycles — the history, the driving factors, their interconnectedness, and the role of psychology — can avoid common errors and best position their portfolio for success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We notice and remember patterns in order to make decisions easier, less painful, and more beneficial, so we don’t think through every decision from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economies, businesses, and markets follow a pattern of cycles. These cycles are irregular because of the swings in humans psychology and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements of a Winning Investment Philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounting, finance, and economics education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An understanding of how markets work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading (broadly) is essential to learning and questioning what you’ve previously learned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchanging ideas with other investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we all have the same information, come to the same conclusions, act on it in the same way, then outperformance is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett’s criteria for desirable information: 1) has to be important, and 2) has to be knowable. Macroeconomic info (forecasting) fails one of those two, usually the latter because it’s not knowable, or not knowable consistently enough to produce long-term outperformance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is best spent on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing the knowable: the fundamentals of business, sectors, industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better behavior: more discipline around price relative to fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding cycles: know where we are in the cycle and how to position a portfolio for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolio risk management is a balancing act between aggressive and defensive, adjusted over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In investing, the future is a range of possibilities — some known, some unknown — making risk and uncertainty unavoidable. The range of possibilities is best viewed as a probability distribution. That leads to knowing the most likely outcome, on average, in the long run. “Most likely” is not guaranteed across any single event (think coin tosses). Randomness in any one event can lead to a unlikely outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any opinion on the future should be based on: 1) what’s going to happen, and 2) the likelihood of being correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions to ask about the current cycle for those who study past cycles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it closer to the beginning upswing or the peak leading to a downswing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has it been rising for a while? To the point of being dangerous?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does investor behavior suggest greed or fear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are investors appropriately risk-averse or excessively risk-tolerant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the market overpriced or cheap due to the cycle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the current point in the cycle emphasize an aggressive or defensive portfolio stance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These questions should help determine the tilt of a portfolio: more aggressive when the odds are in our favor and more defensive when the odds are against us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycles are a continuous swing around a midpoint, which is often a longer-term trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swings follow a generic pattern of: a) recovery from the lows, b) rise past the midpoint to (extreme) highs, c) the new high, d) downward correction, e) fall past the midpoint to the low, f) the new low, g) recovery from the low, and h) back past the midpoint to another high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because cycles are influenced in the short term by people and other variables, it has no constant rate. The duration and speed of each section varies and inevitably causes the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regression to the mean is the move back to the midpoint from the high and low. It’s the powerful self-correcting mechanism in all cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the force behind regression continues to exert itself, the momentum pushes the cycle past the midpoint to the next high or low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who don’t understand cycles will be surprised by, and often contribute to, it. Those who do understand will find opportunities in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extremes are not guaranteed for every swing, but cycles that reach extremes in one direction are often followed by an opposite extreme in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general pattern of a cycle matters, because the specific details at any point in a cycle will look different from similar points in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randomness makes recognizing the pattern in cycles more complicated and less predictable and dependable. The influence of people, their inconsistent behavior, emotions, and actions add to the randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Economic Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The long term economic cycle follows fundamental factors that produce a steady average growth rate over a longer secular trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factors include: population growth which impacts hours worked and GDP growth which is affected by demographic shifts, education, technology/innovation, automation, and globalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the longer secular trend, are short term cycles too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The short term economic cycle is driven by changing variables within a population — the people. For instance, spending fluctuates based on the fear of unemployment. The lack of fear or the “wealth effect” can spur spending. It can create a self-fulfilling prophecy. If people (or companies) believe there’s a recession on the horizon, they spend less (companies hold off on new projects), and the economy inevitably slides into a recession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most economic forecasts extrapolate the current trend because it’s safe (career risk) and sticks to the status quo. Those forecasts are likely already priced into the market and offer no performance benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuable forecasts are outliers that result in surprises that deviate from the trend dramatically. The downside is outliers rarely occur, are hard to predict, and usually wrong — thus can be costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflation is a result of increasing demand for goods relative to supply, an increase in raw materials and labor costs, and/or when a currency tied to imports declines relative to a currency tied to exports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Central Banks have a mandate to control inflation and stimulate employment. The two often work in opposition – steps to stimulate one, contract the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynesian economics: Keynes believed the government should step in to prop up a weak economy through spending/running a deficit but reduce spending/running a surplus in a strong economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Profit Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, the swings in the economy influence the rise and fall of corporate sales, which impacts profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodity, raw material, and basic components see demand rise and fall with the economic cycle. Luxury goods, travel, cars (consumer discretionary), and homes do too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic necessities (consumer staples) like food and medicine are less responsive to the economic cycle. Consumers may trade down — buy cheaper, lower-cost brands in a recession versus expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company profits follow a cycle similar to the economy but not all companies follow the same pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher sales do not guarantee higher profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two Types of Leverage:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Leverage: Most businesses have a combination of fixed and variable costs, meaning costs will fluctuate. So profits depend on the variability of revenues and costs (Profits = Revenues – Costs). Management has some control over profits by managing the variable costs (layoffs, store/factory closures) but it usually takes time and may increases costs in the short-run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Leverage: Debt – cost is tied to interest payments, which rises and falls based on the amount of debt and/or interest rate being charged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A host of independent developments — management decisions, technology changes, regulations, taxation, geopolitical events, natural disasters, etc. — impact profits too, making it hard to predict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor Psychology (Human Nature Cycle):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in psychology affect the economic, profit, and market cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market pendulum swings from greed to fear, optimism to pessimism, risk-tolerant to risk-averse, overpriced to underpriced, and focused on the infinite future to the immediate present. An excess in one direction sets the stage for the swing back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition, yearly market returns fluctuate across a wide range. In other words, earning the average market return in any year is rare. From 1970 to 2016, the return on the S&amp;#x26;P 500 fell within 2% of its average only 3 times! In fact, investors are more likely to experience an extreme return than the average. The wide range of returns in any given year is a good example of investor psychology at work (business fundamentals don’t change that drastically from year to year).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“This cycle in investors’ willingness to value the future is one of the most powerful cycles that exist. A simple metaphor relating to real estate helped me to understand this phenomenon: What’s an empty building worth? An empty building (a) has a replacement value, of course, but it (b) throws off no revenues and (c) costs money to own, in the form of taxes, insurance, minimum maintenance, interest payments and opportunity costs. In other words, it’s a cash drain. When investors are in a pessimistic mood and can’t see more than a few years out, they can only think about the negative cash flows and are unable to imagine a time when the building will be rented and profitable. But when the mood turns upward and interest in future potential runs high, investors envision it full of tenants, throwing off vast amounts of cash, and thus salable at a fancy price. Fluctuation in investors’ willingness to ascribe value to possible future developments represents a variation on the full-or-empty cycle. Its swings are enormously powerful and mustn’t be underestimated.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All investors deal with emotion. The superior investor keeps their emotions in balance and takes an objective approach to investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two failings of an emotional investor: biased perception and interpretation. Investors rarely take a balanced approach to good and bad news. They focus on one-side, leading to a biased view of events. For instance, economic data is twisted in a positive or negative light depending on the prevailing emotion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Risk Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing is “bearing risk in pursuit of profit. Investors try to position portfolios so as to profit from future developments rather than be penalized by them.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk lies in the future not being perfectly knowable. Uncertainty exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How investors behave toward risks influences the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk Aversion: the preference for safety over risk (loss). Most investors are risk-averse. They prefer a certain 7% return over a possible 7% return. An incrementally higher return is required for risk-averse investors to take on risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In theory, risk-averse investors police the market. They’re cautious, analyze investments objectively, use conservative assumptions, require a margin of safety, insist on a requisite return for the risk taken, and avoid investments without it. But that’s not what happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing attitudes towards risk leads investors to be too risk-averse or too risk-tolerant at times. Periods dominated by good news, optimism, greed, and euphoria push investors to be more risk-tolerant than normal. Periods dominated by bad news, pessimism, and fear lead investors to be more risk-averse than normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, risk is highest when investors perceive risk to be lowest. When the collective investor is most risk-averse they should be most risk-tolerant and vice versa. The reward for taking risk is greatest when investors are most risk-averse and vice versa. Opportunity seeking should be highest at peak risk-aversion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate management is not immune to the swings from risk-averse to risk-tolerant either (see the financial crisis).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Credit Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marks believes the credit cycle is the most volatile cycle and has the greatest impact on asset prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The credit cycle — the ability for businesses to borrow quickly and easily — swings from wide open to closed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies turn to credit markets to finance growth and refinance maturing debt. Financial companies depend on credit markets to operate their business smoothly. When the credit window is closed, credit is difficult/impossible to get, and it negatively impacts asset prices. A closed credit market can lead to widespread panic and fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The credit cycle is an example of lenders, borrowers, and investors swinging between risk-averse and risk-tolerant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lenders move from a cautious, risk-averse position unwilling to lend without higher rates and protection from losses to a risk-tolerant, willingness to lend at lower rates and no protection in place out of fear of missing out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive lending often inflates a bubble and creates a crisis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most raging bull markets are abetted by an upsurge in the willingness to provide capital, usually imprudently. Likewise, most collapses are preceded by a wholesale refusal to finance certain companies, industries, or the entire gamut of would-be borrowers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Distressed Debt Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonds and other debt securities are typically bought for the yield and the return of principal at maturity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distressed debt is bought on the basis that the company can no longer pay the interest and principal. When a company files for bankruptcy the equity shareholders are wiped out and debt holders become the new owners of the company. Distressed debt is bought on the anticipation that the new ownership interest in the company (after it emerges from bankruptcy) is worth significantly more than the value of the distressed debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distressed debt investing is cyclical and dependant on other cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires two ingredients: “unwise extension of credit” and “an igniter.” The igniter is usually a recession or credit crunch making it difficult for companies to service their bonds and/or refinance. Those bonds begin to fall in price, selling capitulates until failure is priced in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Real Estate Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real estate cycle has similar ingredients as other cycles — rising optimism, increased activity, higher prices, until it goes too far — but also includes the added time needed for development, involves higher leverage, and adjusting to supply/demand changes is more difficult/less flexible than other industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate development deals with delays, regulations, zoning issues, local approval, financial approval, and construction. It takes months to years to over a decade to complete a project. A lot can happen in the real estate market in the time span.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk is completing a project while the economy is headed for recession with a rising supply/shrinking demand in the market. It’s also an opportunity for would-be buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other risk is not knowing what other developers are doing/thinking. If every developer sees home prices rising and wants to start a project, that ends around the same time, it could lead to excessive supply, lower prices, and lower profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset prices are driven mostly by fundamentals and psychology, often more so by the psychological response to changing fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of the two — fundamentals and psychology — is what makes investing imprecise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor psychology affects and magnifies cycles. It’s also the driven force behind mistakes and losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Stages of a Bull Market: 1) when few people believe things will get better, 2) when most people see things improving, 3) when everyone believes things will stay better forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Stages of a Bear Market: 1) when a few people believe things won’t stay better forever, 2) when most people see things are getting worse, 3) when everyone believes things can only get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bubbles are blown by investor psychology and the suspension of fundamental analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is recognizing where investor psychology and market valuation sits in the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the market stands in the cycle dictates the future probabilities on returns. A market near the bottom of its cycle has a higher probability of higher returns than one closer to the top. Where the market stands in the cycle dictates the likeliness of future outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When to buy? You won’t know when the market bottoms. The risk of waiting “for the bottom” is in missing it and the rally that follows. Better to buy when the price is below value because you can always buy more if the price continues to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk is learning the wrong lessons from past cycles. — Marks references the 2008 crisis and investors’ “learning” that the market always quickly recovers because that was the outcome following the crisis. It fails to consider the alternative outcomes at the depths of the crisis. It could lead to investor behavior that amplifies future cycles because they learned the wrong lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors deal with two sources of error: the risk of losing money and the risk of missing opportunities. Removing one risks exposure to the other. Investing is about balancing the two — between aggressive and defensive. It should be adjusted as you move through a market cycle, assuming you can handle being wrong at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment success is ultimately determined by positioning, asset selection, aggressiveness/defensiveness, skill, and luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positioning: deciding the appropriate portfolio risk level — more/less risk-averse or risk-tolerant — based on the location in the cycles. Positioning increases or decreases the odds of outperformance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Selection: identify asset classes/securities that will be better or worse and weighting — over and under — them based on the required risk level of the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skill and luck determine the outcome of decisions. Luck plays a larger role in the short term than most will admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not knowing the future means being prepared for things that may not go as planned from a portfolio perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploiting market extremes offer the highest odds of success. Between the extremes, the odds become less certain because prices lie closer to value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing requires humility and confidence. Confidence to stick with a strategy when it fails to produce the results you expect but enough humility to know your own limitations. Yet, success often undermines both, leaving investors less humble and overconfident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future cycles will continue to be driven by the collective emotions and decisions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The plain truth is, there’s little of value to be learned from success. People who are successful run the risk of overlooking the fact that they were lucky, or that they had help from others. In investing, success teaches people that making money is easy, and that they don’t have to worry about risk—two particularly dangerous lessons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can’t create great opportunities to time the market through our understanding of cycles. Rather, the market will decide when we’ll have them. Remember, when there’s nothing clever to do, the mistake lies in trying to be clever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After 28 years at this post, and 22 years before this in money management, I can sum up whatever wisdom I have accumulated this way: The trick is not to be the hottest stock-picker, the winningest forecaster, or the developer of the neatest model; such victories are transient. The trick is to survive! Performing that trick requires a strong stomach for being wrong because we are all going to be wrong more often then we expect. The future is not ours to know. But it helps to know that being wrong is inevitable and normal, not some terrible tragedy, not some awful failing in reasoning, not even bad luck in most instances. Being wrong comes with the franchise of an activity whose outcome depends on an unknown future…” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As any system grows toward its maximum or peak efficiency, it will develop the very internal contradictions and weaknesses that bring about its eventual decay and demise.” — Peter Kaufman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study of cycles is really about how to position your portfolio for the possible outcomes that lie ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are two kinds of people who lose a lot of money: those who know nothing and those who know everything.” — Henry Kaufman, Salomon Brothers chief economist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Short-term investment performance is largely a popularity contest, and most bargains exist for the simple reason that they haven’t yet been taken up by the herd and become popular. On the contrary, assets that have performed well are usually the ones that have gained in popularity because of their obvious merit and thus have become high-priced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In investing, everything that’s important is counter-intuitive, and everything that’s obvious to everyone is wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tendency of people to go to excess will never end. And thus, since those excesses eventually have to correct, neither will the occurrence of cycles. Economies and markets have never moved in a straight line in the past, and neither will they do so in the future. And that means investors with the ability to understand cycles will find opportunities for profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are three ingredients for success—aggressiveness, timing and skill—and if you have enough aggressiveness at the right time, you don’t need that much skill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to note that exiting the market after a decline—and thus failing to participate in a cyclical rebound—is truly the cardinal sin in investing. Experiencing a mark-to-market loss in the downward phase of a cycle isn’t fatal in and of itself, as long as you hold through the beneficial upward part as well. It’s converting that downward fluctuation into a permanent loss by selling out at the bottom that’s really terrible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Falling for the sure thing—the asset that will provide return without risk, or what I call the “silver bullet”—is one of investors’ greatest recurring failings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no such thing as a market that is separate from—and unaffected by—the people who make it up. The behavior of the people in the market changes the market. When their attitudes and behavior change, the market will change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The key questions can be boiled down to two: how are things priced, and how are investors around us behaving?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No asset or company is so good that it can’t become overpriced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s only one form of intelligent investing, and that’s figuring out what something’s worth and buying it for that price or less. You can’t have intelligent investing in the absence of quantification of value and insistence on an attractive purchase price. Any investment movement that’s built around a concept other than the relationship between price and value is irrational.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is nothing as disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.” — Charles Kindleberger, Manias, Panics, and Crashes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Few things are as costly as paying for potential that turns out to have been overrated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our job as investors is simple: to deal with the prices of assets, assessing where they stand today and making judgments regarding how they will change in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Conscientious belief in the inevitability of cycles like I’m urging means that a number of words and phrases must be excluded from the intelligent investor’s vocabulary. These include “never,” “always,” “forever,” “can’t,” “won’t,” “will” and “has to.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not for nothing that they often say cynically—in tougher times, when optimistic generalizations can no longer be summoned forth—that “only the third owner makes money.” Not the developer who conceived and initiated the project. And not the banker who loaned the money for its construction and then repossessed the project from the developer in the down-cycle. But rather the investor who bought the property from the bank amid distress and then rode the up-cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In making investments, it has become my habit to worry less about the economic future—which I’m sure I can’t know much about—than I do about the supply/demand picture relating to capital. Being positioned to make investments in an uncrowded arena conveys vast advantages. Participating in a field that everyone’s throwing money at is a formula for disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When risk tolerance takes over and lenders compete avidly for opportunities, the bidding is likely to become overheated. The resulting opportunity to lend is likely to be at too high a price: a yield that’s too low and/or risk that’s excessive. Thus an overheated auction in the credit market—as elsewhere—is likely to produce a “winner” who’s really a loser. This is the process I call the race to the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prosperity brings expanded lending, which leads to unwise lending, which produces large losses, which makes lenders stop lending, which ends prosperity, and on and on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Superior investing doesn’t come from buying high-quality assets, but from buying when the deal is good, the price is low, the potential return is substantial, and the risk is limited… The slammed-shut phase of the credit cycle probably does more to make bargains available than any other single factor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In investing, there is nothing that always works, since the environment is always changing, and investors’ efforts to respond to the environment cause it to change further.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my view, risk is primarily the likelihood of permanent capital loss. But there’s also such a thing as opportunity risk: the likelihood of missing out on potential gains. Put the two together and we see that risk is the possibility of things not going the way we want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Essentially risk says we don’t know what’s going to happen… We walk every moment into the unknown. There’s a range of outcomes, and we don’t know where [the actual outcome is] going to fall within the range. Often we don’t know what the range is.” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Risk means more things can happen than will happen.” — Elroy Dimson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The events in the life of a cycle shouldn’t be viewed merely as each being followed by the next, but — much more importantly — as each causing the next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people understand that busts follow booms. Somewhat fewer grasp the fact that the busts are caused by the booms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The greatest lessons regarding cycles are learned through experience…as in the adage ‘experience is what you got when you didn’t get what you wanted.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Societies rise and fall, and they speed up and slow down in terms of economic growth relative to each other. This underlying trend in growth clearly follows a long-term cycle, although the short-run ups and downs around it are more discernible and thus more readily discussed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All these people see the same data, read the same material, and spend their time trying to guess what each other is going to say. [Their forecasts] will always be moderately right—and almost never of much use.” — Milton Friedman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have two classes of forecasters: those who don’t know — and those who don’t know they don’t know.” — John Kenneth Galbraith&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The mood swings of the securities markets resemble the movement of a pendulum. Although the midpoint of its arc best describes the location of the pendulum “on average,” it actually spends very little of its time there. Instead, it is almost always swinging toward or away from the extremes of its arc. But whenever the pendulum is near either extreme, it is inevitable that it will move back toward the midpoint sooner or later. In fact, it is the movement toward an extreme itself that supplies the energy for the swing back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of the highly superior investors I know are unemotional by nature. In fact, I believe their unemotional nature is one of the great contributors to their success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the real world, things generally fluctuate between “pretty good” and “not so hot.” But in the world of investing, perception often swings from “flawless” to “hopeless.” The pendulum careens from one extreme to the other, spending almost no time at “the happy medium” and rather little in the range of reasonableness. First there’s denial, and then there’s capitulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since risk (that is, uncertainty with regard to future developments, and the possibility of bad outcomes) is the primary source of the challenge in investing, the ability to understand, assess and deal with risk is the mark of the superior investor and an essential—I’m tempted to say the essential—requirement for investment success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good times cause people to become more optimistic, jettison their caution, and settle for skimpy risk premiums on risky investments. Further, since they are less pessimistic and less alarmed, they tend to lose interest in the safer end of the risk/return continuum. This combination of elements makes the prices of risky assets rise relative to safer assets. Thus it shouldn’t come as a surprise that more unwise investments are made in good times than in bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, the bottom line of all of this is that the greatest source of investment risk is the belief that there is no risk. Widespread risk tolerance—or a high degree of investor comfort with risk—is the greatest harbinger of subsequent market declines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s the greatest source of investment risk? … It comes when asset prices attain excessively high levels as a result of some new, intoxicating investment rationale that can’t be justified on the basis of fundamentals, and that causes unreasonably high valuations to be assigned. And when are these prices reached? When risk aversion and caution evaporate and risk tolerance and optimism take over. This condition is the investor’s greatest enemy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When total fear replaces a high degree of confidence, excessive risk aversion takes the place of unrealistic risk tolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I could ask only one question regarding each investment I had under consideration, it would be simple: How much optimism is factored into the price?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There can be few fields of human endeavor in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance. Past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.” — John Kenneth Galbraith, A Short History of Financial Euphoria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to fully understand most phenomena in the investment world unless you’ve lived through them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Value investing has a long record of excellent returns with limited downside risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a book about how to think about investing — you have to understand why value investing works. It’s not enough to know the rules behind it, but understand why the rules work, when they work, and when they don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wall Street Misbehavior: short term focused, driven by the volume of activity, ignorant of business fundamentals, casino operator, pushing index strategies designed to avoid volatility at the cost of mediocre returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutional Investor Misbehavior: short term focused, driven by performance pressure, compensation, and career risk, which pushes relative performance and fad chasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors Misbehavior: they are their own worst enemies — greed, fear, and other emotions cause investors to ignore fundamentals when making decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misbehavior creates opportunities for value investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can treat stocks as pieces of paper to be traded based on guessing its next price move or you can treat stocks as ownership in a business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest challenge is patience and discipline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors profit by:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free cash flow made by the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase in the multiple paid that’s reflected in the share price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share price moves closer to the value of the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading Sardines versus Eating Sardines: The story goes that sardines once thrived off the coast of Monterey, California until one day they disappeared. The commodity traders bid up the price of sardines and canned sardine prices soared. One day, a commodity trader helped himself to a can, opened it, and began eating. He quickly got sick. The sardines were no good. To which his friend replied, “These are not eating sardines, they are trading sardines.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculation can erupt anytime, anywhere, and not be recognized until much later, and after much money has been invested and lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driven by instant gratification: getting rich quickly is more appealing than getting rich slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greater Fool Game: buying a stock with the hopes a greater fool will quickly take it off your hands at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazy Game: requires no analysis or information about the business. It’s guessing what other investors will do, and try to do it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectibles are a speculative game since prices are driven by taste, not free cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winchester Disk Drive Mania:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;43 Winchester disk driver manufacturers received venture funding between 1977 and 1984.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By mid-1983, 12 of the publicly traded manufacturers of disk drives were valued at $5 billion in total.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was no chance all 12, much less 43, would dominate the market — only a few might survive. Nor would the market be remotely worth $5 billion in the future (based on a study done in 1983).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 1984, the total market of the 12 public companies was down to $1.5 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Market: is a helpful fellow. Every day he’s ready to buy or sell securities at a price he set that minute. Sometimes the prices are reasonable. Sometimes, emotion gets the best of him. He becomes optimistic or pessimistic and his prices reflect it. If you look to Mr. Market for guidance, thinking his prices hold meaning, it can lead to speculation and loss. Beware: Mr. Market’s prices hold no hidden meaning. He knows nothing. It’s only the collective action of millions of buyers and sellers whose actions aren’t always motivated by fundamentals. You can take advantage of Mr. Market’s frequent emotional moments or do nothing. It’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why security prices move (up and down):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reflect reality or changes in perception of reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short term changes in supply and demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all market selloffs are buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has a bullish bias. An optimistic case can be made for any security, and often is made. It’s also more enjoyable for management and investors to hear the optimistic view. But a focus on optimistic outcomes comes with a cost of ignoring risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Innovation: early success does not equate to being good. It often looks better early on, but the merits of any financial innovation must be determined over the course of a full market cycle. Problems often take time to surface. What’s lauded as a new improved way to invest is really just a fad — one that could be taken to an extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Fads: investors slap optimistic growth numbers on new technology, products, etc. that don’t fit reality. Unsustainable multiples are the end result. Market history is filled with optimistic fads that failed to live up to expectations and came to an abrupt end. The cycle of fads is a byproduct of investor behavior and unlikely to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career Risk: some fund managers invest to protect their jobs which can lead to groupthink, herd mentality, and mediocre returns closer to their benchmark (and underperform after fees). Because the risk of trying to earn the best return possible over the long run comes with the risk of underperformance, that might not sit well with investors. It leads to a short-term relative performance bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be wary of fund managers who don’t (won’t) invest their own money in funds they run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fully invested or not should depend on the number of available opportunities. Doing nothing — not being fully invested — is a smart option when opportunities are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why understand institutional investors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They dominate the market, so their behavior has a big impact on markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutional investors are often too big to invest in certain areas of the market that, in turn, offer rewarding opportunities for smaller investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk Bond Mania:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Junk bonds were sold as a new innovation in the 1980s that took on manic proportions. Initially hailed as “safe” investments but by 1990 defaults hit record levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W. Braddock Hickman showed, via a study, that a portfolio of low quality, high yield bonds could outperform a high-quality bond portfolio. The higher rates more than compensated for defaults and losses. It worked because enough investors avoided low-quality bonds, causing depressed prices. Price appreciation, not yields, was behind the better return. The real opportunity was in bonds priced to default — fallen angels selling well below par — which then improved and recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milken took the idea that high-yield bonds outperformed, pushed it excess, but left out the important point of depressed prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milken claimed low-rated bonds earned a historically higher return than highly-rated bonds. He also claimed that the risk was low because losses from defaults were easily compensated by higher yields. And he claimed liquidity wouldn’t be a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike fallen angels selling below par, Milken’s newly issued junk bonds were sold at par value. There was no chance of price appreciation. They were already priced for perfection (survival). New junk bonds came onto the market with limited upside and a big risk of default and loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because junk bonds were a new concept, the default rate was deceptively low for two reasons: defaults can take time and the number of defaults lagged behind the number of junk bond issuances — the denominator (# of junk bond issuances) outgrew the numerator (# of defaults). The true default rate was only uncovered once new issues slowed and ceased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deceptively low default rate was used to promote the “junk bonds are safe” narrative. High yields for little or no risk become a big selling point that quickly caught on. The high demand allowed junk bonds to be issued by virtually anyone looking to borrow money, from unsound small businesses in need of debt to corporate takeovers artists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study on the interest coverage ratio of newly issued junk bonds had fallen to below 1 by 1988. Pretax earnings were less than the interest expense on new issues. Debt to net assets tripled over the same period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newly created high-yield bond funds helped drive demand and forced their competition, which held higher-quality bonds, to swap high-quality for high-yield in order to compete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few thrifts (S&amp;#x26;Ls) used junk bonds, along with other risky assets, to offer a higher interest rate on accounts and grow their deposits, but it ultimately led to their insolvency and the S&amp;#x26;L crisis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rate resets became a widely used feature on junk bonds — it’s a promise that the issuer will reset the coupon at a specific date to cause it to trade around a specific price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBITDA became the proxy for free cash flow when valuing highly leveraged businesses. Which led to flawed analysis and overvaluation. If interest is large enough, like it was at the time, no earnings would exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a historically accepted investment yardstick proves to be overly restrictive, the path of least resistance is to invent a new standard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding loss should be the first goal. That does not mean no losses of any kind. A portfolio, over time, should not be exposed to the chance of significant losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loss avoidance strategy is not about having a fixed allocation to certain securities or having a fixed return goal to meet. It’s about knowing that unexpected things happen, risks always change, so you have to be prepared for that eventuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk depends on the price paid for a security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the effects of compounding even moderate returns over many years are compelling, if not downright mind-boggling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compounding requires perseverance in order to succeed. It’s important to avoid extreme losses since it can quickly wipe out years of compounding that has built up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors intent on avoiding loss consequently must position themselves to survive and even prosper under any circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the future is unpredictable, it’s impossible to know what markets will do next. Or the economy. Or interest rates. Bad luck, mistakes, rare catastrophes, and crises do happen. Investors need to be prepared for when these unexpected surprises happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value investing is buying dollars for 50 cents — buying securities at a discount to their underlying value. It combines a conservative value analysis with the discipline to only buy when a discount to value is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett’s baseball analogy: Investors have no called strikes. Nobody’s keeping track of the number of pitches you see. You don’t have to swing at any pitch (investments). You can patiently stand at the plate with the bat on your shoulder, waiting for the perfect pitches — the ones you’re most comfortable with, that you understand the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New investments must be weighed against other available opportunities and existing holdings. It ensures that your portfolio is always made up of the best opportunities. That means no investment is sacred, especially if a better one comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be comfortable with imperfect information because you’ll never know everything about an investment. And if you did know everything, then the opportunity is likely gone because the market already priced it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ways to protect from declining business values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always do conservative valuations, with the worst-case scenario or liquidation value in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require a wider margin of safety — a deeper discount to fair value — to account for risks like deflation that lower the value of an investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catalysts, that offer a time frame to realize value, help offset uncertainty that comes with the typical unknown time horizon for most investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin of Safety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows for imperfection, error, bad luck, or excessive volatility in order to avoid big losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between price and fair value is your margin of safety. The wider the difference, the wider margin, the more protected you are from surprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preservation of capital is built-in and necessary because valuation is imperfect, the future is unpredictable, and people make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin of safety can be improved by replacing a current holding with better opportunities, selling once value is mostly realized, and holding cash when no significant bargains exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to know why an investment is undervalued and to sell when it no longer applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for management that puts their own money at risk in the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear markets are the real test of an investment philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In market declines, stocks are often priced as if nothing can go right. They have the widest margin of safety and the lowest amount of risk because the worst-case scenario is priced in. They also have the highest upside. When focus and expectations shift from the worst-case to the strength of business fundamentals, the market will send prices higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value investing is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on bottom-up analysis – it makes it easier to know when the reason why behind an investment no longer applies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolute over relative performance – allows investments to be judged on their own merits, while not worrying about what the market is doing in the short term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused on what can go wrong over what can go right – keeps risk front of mind and helps to avoid losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk can’t be reduced to a number. Risk is weighed by imperfect analysis — the probability and amount of potential loss for any investment include unknowns. It’s why a margin of safety, diversification, and hedging are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunity Cost: Build a portfolio with opportunity cost in mind. Holding some cash or securities that throw off cash in a portfolio helps offset opportunity costs. Investments with catalysts, like risk-arbitrage, tend to be short term in nature which also helps as investments are sold for cash plus profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Valuation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business valuation is an art. It’s imperfect. It changes with micro- and macroeconomic changes. Assumptions of future cash flows can be made down to the penny. Just because you can discount future cash flows out to the nth decimal place doesn’t make the calculation precise or accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Graham sought to find a valuation that is adequate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets are the collective result of a difference of opinion. Buyers place the value of a security higher than what they paid. Sellers put the value lower than they’re selling price. They both feel they’re getting a deal. The buyer and seller likely differ on their assumptions of the future cash flows, the discount rate, etc. leading to a range in valuation. The true value likely falls somewhere in between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discount future cash flows (NPV analysis) can be a very accurate valuation method. But…less than certain cash flows, inaccurate growth forecasts, and arbitrary discount rates can be problematic and imprecise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More stable businesses tend to be more predictable (not always) but the predictability means it’s less likely to be selling at a deep discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many factors go into a business’s growth, making it difficult to predict — unit sales, population growth, product usage, market share, price increase…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biases — optimism or pessimism — influencing the numbers will throw the valuation further off. Too much optimism in projections could mean that everything has to go right for the projections to work out or losses are certain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conservative assumptions are the only solution to the problem of inaccurate valuations. Then invest at a discount to the conservative valuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no correct discount rate — it depends on: the investor’s risk profile, the riskiness of the investment, and alternative investment options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dividend discount method can ignore a large percentage of total cash flows and projecting dividends far into the future often ignores the chance of cuts or accuracy in predicting raises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private market valuation – must ignore inflated prices paid in takeovers when using private market valuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidation Value (net-net working capital) — current assets minus current and long-term liabilities. Offers protection — worst-case scenario — if bought below liquation value. Beware of operations that can quickly burn through current assets, underfunded pensions, environmental laws around plant closings, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relative valuation: is a yardstick for assessing how the market values businesses in a similar industry today. Useful in assessing how the market might value a subsidiary or spinoff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which valuation method to use? It depends on the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings per share is imprecise, hard to project, and can be manipulated. Nonrecurring earnings (one-time items) should be ignored as it inflates earnings. Earnings (or cash flow) is just one way to understand what’s going on inside a business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book value can be imprecise depending on the asset in question. Current assets are generally accurately valued. Building, plant, and equipment may not be. Outside factors like inflation, technology innovation, regulation can affect asset value too that can’t be easily assessed — not always negatively. Regulations may introduce scarcity making an old plant more valuable due to the higher cost of building a new one. Book value is only one piece in an analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend yield can be deceptive. A high yield might look attractive but is likely the result of a fallen stock price…with a potential dividend cut priced in. The company’s ability to survive a prolonged downturn and pay a dividend needs to assessed along with yield.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theory of Reflexivity — stock price can influence business value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a business needs additional capital, stock price determines its success. With a high stock price, built on optimism, the market might see new share issuance as a positive. Whereas with a low stock price, a new issuance might be viewed negatively or not be possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When management sees stock prices, not fundamentals, determine valuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflexivity is a wild card — occasionally very important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value Investing Niches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discount to Liquidation Value — net-net working capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate-of-Return Situations: where time frame and exit prices are more predictable — risk arbitrage around mergers, tender offers, etc. where a catalyst is involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset Conversions: distressed debt, bankruptcies, recapitalization, and exchange offers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important that investors figure out why a bargain became a bargain. Ask: What’s wrong with it? What are the flaws? The reason may help decide how predictable the outcome is and whether its a better or worse investment because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value investing is contrarian, investing against the herd, avoiding what’s popular, searching for the ignored and unloved securities. Because of this, value investors almost always look wrong and experience paper losses at first — get used to it. Eventually, opinions and trends change, the unloved become loved, and security prices rise to fair value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, no matter how much research is performed, some information always remains elusive; investors have to learn to live with less than complete information. Second, even if an investor could know all the facts about an investment, he or she would not necessarily profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamental analysis is subject to diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 80/20 rule: 80% of available information is found in the first 20% of the time spent searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low prices come with high uncertainty. Waiting for perfect information leads to missed opportunities (once all information is available, prices have risen). Investors buying at low prices in uncertain times, often do so at a wider margin of safety, that provides protection from the added risk of uncertainty, and still get rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying along with insiders can be profitable. Watch for insider buying, with their own money, in the open market. Insiders have many reasons to sell, but only one reason to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalysts help reduce risk. Since catalysts come with a defined time frame, value realization happens quicker and lowers the chance of loss in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalysts for total value realization: liquation or sale of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalysts for partial value realization: spinoffs, recapitalizations, buybacks, asset sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex Securities: securities with unusual contractual cash flow characteristics tied to a contingent event. Often rare, unusual, and hard to evaluate, which leads investors to avoid entirely, limiting demand and creating value. Klarman gives several examples:  participation certificates, certain preferred stock with unusual features, contingent-value rights, and rights offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk Arbitrage: gain/loss depends on the completion of a takeover deal. Returns are determined by the spread between the price paid and the amount paid on completion of the deal. The downside is the transaction or deal fails. Goes through periods of popularity. Periods of high uncertainty can make risk arbitrage opportunities attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All investment philosophies and niche strategies go through a cycle of popularity. When a strategy becomes popular, it sees more money flow in, increases buying, higher prices, and reduces future returns. A period of poor returns sees money outflows, prices fall, popularity wanes, and raises future returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinoffs result when a parent company distributes shares in a subsidiary to its existing shareholder. It’s often an attempt by management to unlock value — where the parts are greater than the combined business. Spinoffs can be underfollowed, often small-caps, that are quickly sold by existing shareholders for a number of reasons. It can lead to undervalued opportunities in the spinoff or the parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conservative valuation is more important in highly leveraged businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distressed/Bankrupt Securities: difficult to analyze and come with a stigma around bankruptcy that keeps most investors out of these securities. It creates attractive opportunities with debt selling way below par. Companies that file for bankruptcy have hit bottom — nowhere to go but up, once lenders are satisfied and new financing becomes available. But it requires caution. Not all companies recover to their former glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Distress Scenarios (must consider the possibility of each):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue payment of principal and interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchange new securities for those outstanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default and file for bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Cost-cutting, asset sales, or outside capital are other short-term options considered by management before the above scenarios. It can lead to a worsening of the long term business value.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bondholders, unlike shareholders, can’t be forced to go along with an exchange offer or other deal by the majority of bondholders who agree to it. There’s an upside and downside in holding out — like the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Often creditors will agree to a plan in advance of bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior securities, during a bankruptcy, often move independent of the market, since it’s tied to the progress of the reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Stages of Bankruptcy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Chapter 11 filing: highest uncertainty, lowest information, greatest opportunity (if it exists) — the financial situation is uncertain, financial statements missing/late, liabilities are not obvious, securities prices highly volatile, and debt holders may be forced to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiation of reorganization plan: months to years to reach this point — the financial situation is known but uncertainty exists around the plan and how each creditor class will fair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalization of a plan and emerging from bankruptcy: takes three months to a year — closer to a risk-arbitrage dependent on final approval, plan being contested or rejected by a creditor or plan falls through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Distressed Securities: requires patience, returns are dependent on timing, often illiquid, price must be the primary focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Distress Valuation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starts with valuing the assets, split into two groups — current assets (cash, investment securities, assets held for sale) and assets of the operating business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Account for any income statement or cash flow distortions like interest expense not being paid, costs of Chapter 11, etc. that will or won’t exist once out of bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at off-balance sheet assets — real estate carried below value, pension fund, patents, claims owed to IRS, EPA, PBGC, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze liabilities in descending order — may find opportunities at each level of debt structure, senior debt being less risky, junior debt offering greater returns but a higher risk of loss. Common stock should be avoided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duration must be assessed with liquidity risk. Investors should be compensated more for the risk of holding an illiquid investment over a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity is dependent on the availability of buyers and sellers. Liquidity is prevalent in normal markets, non-existent in panics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the right balance for a portfolio between liquidity and illiquidity, low risk and high risk, low return and high return can be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A portfolio with systematic liquation or cash flows built-in – via dividends or sales — can help avoid complacency and add a challenge of always looking for best available bargains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolio management should be about risk reduction. Reducing risk at the portfolio level, while accounting for risk in individual investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a fine line between diversification and over-diversification. 10-15 holdings is enough for Klarman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market risk can be limited by hedging, but can also be costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunity is a function of price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klarman recommends buying partial positions and averaging down if price declines. If your analysis is good, you should want to own more at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling is the hardest part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since valuation is imperfect, knowing what price to sell at is also imperfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should be based on underlying value, alternative opportunities, liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probabilities allow for the possibility of luck in investment returns. It’s up to investors to assess past success — their’s and fund managers’ — to luck or skill. Hopefully, done so humbly and objectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor returns might be due to a bad strategy, bad luck, or an out of favor strategy, soon to be in favor, thanks to mean reversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Disregarding for the moment whether the prevailing level of stock prices on January 1, 1987 was logical, we are certain that the value of American industry in the aggregate had not increased by 44% as of August 25. Similarly, it is highly unlikely that the value of American industry declined by 23% on a single day, October 19.” — Ruane and Cunniff on 1987.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since security prices reflect investors’ perception of reality and not necessarily reality itself, overvaluation may persist for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In investing it is never wrong to change your mind. It is only wrong to change your mind and do nothing about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The trick of successful investors is to sell when they want to, not when they have to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The essential point is that security analysis does not seek to determine exactly what is the intrinsic value of a given security. It needs only to establish that the value is adequate – e.g., to protect a bond or to justify a stock purchase – or else that the value is considerably higher or considerably lower than the market price. For such purposes an indefinite and approximate measure of the intrinsic value may be sufficient.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any attempt to value businesses with precision will yield values that are precisely inaccurate. The problem is that it is easy to confuse the capability to make precise forecasts with the ability to make accurate ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Small changes in either revenues or expenses cause far greater percentage changes in profits. The number of things that can go wrong greatly exceeds the number that can go right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As with any value investment, the greater the undervaluation, the greater the margin of safety to investors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A simple rule applies: if you don’t quickly comprehend what a company is doing, then management probably doesn’t either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the herd mentality of investors can cause all companies in an out-of-favor industry, however disparate, to be tarred with the same brush.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In an illiquid market the price at which a security transaction takes place is determined not so much by investment fundamentals as by the trading savvy of the participants. In the illiquid market for distressed and bankrupt bonds, being a smart trader may sometimes be more important than being a smart analyst.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All investors must come to terms with the relentless continuity of the investment process. Although specific investments have a beginning and an end, portfolio management goes on forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since no investor is infallible and no investment is perfect, there is considerable merit in being able to change one’s mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the stock market, there is liquidity for the individual but not for the whole community. The distributable profits of a company are the only rewards for the community.” — Louis Lowenstein, What’s Wrong with Wall Street&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Diversification, after all, is not how many different things you own, but how different the things you do own are in the risks they entail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best investment opportunities arise when other investors act unwisely thereby creating rewards for those who act intelligently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is only one valid rule for selling: all investments are for sale at the right price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Returns must always be examined in the context of risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;James Montier writes about the many ways investors are their own worst enemies. The book concentrates on the many repeated behavioral mistakes investors inflict on themselves that negatively impact returns in the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you get started… we all think the behavioral biases discussed below don’t apply to us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, we’re better at recognizing these biases in others than ourselves — bias blind spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, All of these biases can be found outside of investing too — diet, exercise, shopping, and other habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of our decision-making process is hardwired, having been built around survival over the past 100,000 years. It’s generally useful. Also, it tends to conflict with investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Montier breaks decision making into two systems: the X-system is the default, quick, emotional responses or the mental shortcuts. The C-System is the slow, logical, deliberate, deductive responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of us believe we run on the C-System.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of us really rely heavily on the X-System. Because it still works often enough, we trust it more often than we should. Especially for investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a three-question test to see how well we override the X-System:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bat and a ball together cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it takes five minutes for five machines to make five widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long will it take to cover half the lake?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answers: 1.  $0.05,  2.  5 minutes,  3.  47 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the original study behind the test, only 17% got all three questions right and 33% got none right. In a group of professional investors, 40% got all three right and 10% got none right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if you got all three questions right and think you’re impervious to biases, you’re not — overoptimism, overconfidence, and confirmation bias are not immune from the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the test prove? We’re good at leaping to the first conclusion rather thinking things through. It works great if we’re trying to survive being mauled by an animal, but works terribly if we’re trying to survive in the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best defense against your biases is “to ingrain better behavior into your investment approach.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy Gaps&lt;/strong&gt; — The “inability to predict our own future behavior under emotional strain.” In other words, we have a hard time predicting how we’ll act during some future stressful event. We overestimate our intellectual abilities and underestimate our emotional drive.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example #1: How we think we’ll act during the next market crash versus how we really act during the next market crash. It’s easy to think we’ll buy stocks during the next crash, especially when we think it while markets are calm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example #2: Our inability to factor procrastination into a project. The solution is to impose deadlines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors can prevent empathy gaps by planning ahead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Montier offers up the seven P’s: Perfect Planning and Preparation Prevent Piss Poor Performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to be able to buy the market when everyone is feverishly selling and not fall prey to similar emotional decisions, then have a plan of attack set up in advance that forces the action. Sir John Templeton used to set a wishlist of great companies he wanted to buy if they were only cheaper. He’d place standing buy orders at reduced prices to force purchases when emotions are normally running high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeremy Grantham: “There is only one cure for terminal paralysis: you absolutely must have a battle plan for reinvestment and stick to it. Since every action must overcome paralysis, what I recommend is a few large steps, not many small ones. A single giant step at the low would be nice, but without holding a signed contract with the devil, several big moves would be safer. It is particularly important to have a clear definition of what it will take for you to be fully invested.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-Optimism Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we tend to be optimistic by nature. we have a positive bias, believing good results will happen more often than bad results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Illusion of Control&lt;/strong&gt; — we think we can influence the outcome and often mistake randomness for control. Also, the illusion of control enhances our optimistic tendencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Serving Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we tend to act in our best interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default question for investors: “Why should I own this investment?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overconfidence Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we tend to be more confident in our own abilities. We believe we’re above average (drivers, lovers, workers, investors, predictors of the future) even though we can’t all be above average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, we often confuse confidence in ourselves and others for skill. We prefer people who sound confident even when they’re wrong. And worse, we tend to believe the more confident experts, and do so without any level of skepticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-optimism and overconfidence&lt;/strong&gt; in investing leads to more trading, higher turnover, and underperformance. Also, men are worse than women. Simply, it leads to a belief that we’re not only smarter than everyone else but we can get in and out of the market faster than everyone else.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, we can’t all be smarter than everyone else. What we can be is more disciplined than the overconfident, over-optimist investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guessing the future is hard. Overconfidence doesn’t help. All the evidence points to it being practically impossible without luck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if you want to try, you have to get the forecast right, then you have correctly guess how the market will react, and finally, you have to guess which investment vehicle will profit the most … even still, the only way you’ll beat the market is if it’s different from the consensus view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forecasts are demand driven by investors who somehow believe it’s useful (like in confirming their beliefs or offering an illusion of certainty or as an anchor to base decisions around).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or as Howard Marks says: “In my opinion, the key to dealing with the future lies in knowing where you are, even if you can’t know precisely where you’re going.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Illusion of Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; — confusing a surface understanding of something with a deep knowledge of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal vs Noise&lt;/strong&gt; — not a bias, but is made worse by biases. Being incapable of separating what’s useful (signal) from the useless (noise) leads to mistakes. And we tend to overweight some info, underweight other info, and completely ignore others. So more information doesn’t necessarily produce better results. Studies show more information does not make us more accurate, just overconfident on our accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checklists can help filter the noise from the few pieces of information or factors that really matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Jean-Marie Eveillard of First Eagle affirms my contention by saying, “It’s very common to drown in the details or be attracted to complexity, but what’s most important to me is to know what three, four, or five major characteristics of the business really matter. I see my job primarily as asking the right questions and focusing the analysis in order to make a decision.&quot;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day to day market fluctuations is mostly random. That doesn’t stop everyone from trying to give meaning to the movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“When it comes to the vagaries of the ups and downs of financial markets, Larry Summers provides us with the outside view. He co-authored a paper in 1989 that explored the 50 largest moves in the U.S. stock market between 1947 and 1987. Summers and colleagues scoured the press to see if they could find any reason for the market moves. They concluded “On most of the sizable return days…the information that the press cites as the cause of the market move is not particularly important. Press reports on adjacent days also fail to reveal any convincing accounts of why future profits or discount rates might have changed.” To put it another way, more than half of the largest moves in markets are totally unrelated to anything that might be classed as fundamentals.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fictional stories might offer some certainty for the randomness of markets but its all nonsense. It’s better to just tune out the noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we are more likely to look for information that agrees with our conclusions, beliefs, and decisions than disagrees.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes we discount disconfirming evidence as “wrong,” sometimes we’re willfully blind to it, and sometimes we twist it to support our conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Time and again, psychologists have found that confidence and biased assimilation perform a strange tango. It appears the more sure people were that they had the correct view, the more they distorted new evidence to suit their existing preference, which in turn made them even more confident.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falsification&lt;/strong&gt; — the process of trying to prove something wrong.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: We need to go out of our way to prove ourselves wrong. Learn the opposing view. Ask, “What are all the ways it could go wrong?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conservatism Bias — we’re slow to change our minds when new information arrives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunk Cost Fallacy — the tendency to allow past costs (like time, money, emotion, or effort) to affect current decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchoring, confirmation bias, overconfidence, and the sunk cost fallacy are reasons why we’re slow to change our minds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The classic study on conservatism…concludes its analysis by saying: “A convenient first approximation to the data would say that it takes anywhere from two to five observations to do one observation’s worth in inducing the subject to change their opinions.” In other words, people underreact to things that should make them change their minds…I should also point out that it appears that people are particularly bad at spotting regime changes. Researchers have shown that in a series of experiments using urns…people tend to underreact in unstable environments with precise signals (turning points), but overreact to stable environments with noisy signals (trending markets). This helps explain why economists and analysts tend to miss turning points in the market. They get hung up on the stable environment and overreact to it; hence they miss the important things that happen when the environment becomes more unstable (a recession starts) and underreact to such developments.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative Fallacy&lt;/strong&gt; — giving meaning to a sequence of random events or facts by weaving a story that forces a link of cause and effect rather than judging each individual event or fact on its own merits.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nassim Taleb describes it like this: “The fallacy is associated with our vulnerability to over-interpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stories are in constant supply in the stock market. Every stock covered in the media is given a story. IPOs literally go on a roadshow to spread their story. Then there are story stocks, which trade not on fundamentals, but hope and promise of future potential. All these stories affect our views. Almost all have an emotional pull to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The most-admired companies tend to be those that have done well in the past, in both stock market and financial performance. They also tend to be relatively expensive. For instance, the average sales growth for a company in the most-admired list is 10 percent per year over the last two years. In contrast, the despised stocks seem to have been disasters, with an average sales growth of just 3.5 percent. Thus the admired stocks have great stories and high prices attached to them, whereas the despised stocks have terrible stories and sport low valuations. Which would you rather own? Psychologically, we know you will feel attracted to the admired stocks. Yet, the despised stocks are generally a far better investment. They significantly outperform the market as well as the admired stocks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: Always stick to the facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Ben Graham insisted that “safety must be based on study and standards, ” and that valuations be “justified by the facts, e.g., the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct, let us say, from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excesses.” These wise words ring as true today as when Graham wrote them way back in 1934, but very few investors seem capable of heeding them. Focusing on the cold hard facts (soundly based in real numbers) is likely to be our best defense against the siren song of stories.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictable Surprises&lt;/strong&gt; — like bubbles, predictable surprises may be seen but the timing of them is always uncertain. Example: Several people recognized the housing bubble in advance but no one knew when it would burst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myopia — extreme focus on the short term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inattentional Blindness&lt;/strong&gt; — being blind to the obvious because we’re focused on something else.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over-optimism, the illusion of control, self-serving bias, myopia, and inattentional blindness help prevent us from seeing bubbles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: know that bubbles won’t last forever. All eventually burst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, bubbles tend to follow a similar pattern described by John Stuart Mill: Displacement –&gt; Credit Creation –&gt; Euphoria –&gt; Financial Distress (Critical Stage) –&gt; Revulsion
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Displacement — the start created by some opportunity or innovation in a sector of the market. New investment in the area germinates confidence slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit Creation — new credit (new money i.e. new share issuance) feeds the flames, feeds growth, confidence, and higher prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Euphoria — Prices can only go up is the story. New valuation metrics are created to replace the old and justify higher prices. Over-optimism and overconfidence abound. Speculation runs rampant. “This time is different!” is the word on the street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Distress (Critical Stage) — The weight of excessive leverage shows signs of cracking, fraud is found, insiders sell, prices fall, and margin loans are called.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revulsion — Panic ensues, investors would rather sell at any price than own it. The worst cases are scarred for life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Long term) Individual investors have an advantage over professionals when it comes to investing in bubbles (and in general). They’re not beholden to a benchmark or strategy or career risk or redemptions. And they don’t have to broadcast their holdings to anyone. They only have to manage their behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, bubbles continue to repeat because we fail to learn from past mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeremy Grantham on learning from the financial crisis: “We will learn an enormous amount in the very short term, quite a bit in the medium term, and absolutely nothing in the long term. That would be the historical precedent.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason we fail to learn from our mistakes is that…we don’t see them as mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Attribution Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we see success due to skill and failure due to bad luck, out of our control, or blame it on someone (something) else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hindsight Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — the knew-it-all-along-effect. After knowing the outcome, we believe it was more easily predictable than it was at the time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: keeping a record of the reasons behind investment decisions and track the outcomes — skill (right for the right reasons), good luck (right for the wrong reasons), bad luck (wrong for the right reasons), mistakes (wrong for the wrong reasons). It holds us accountable for our original views before the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Maynard Keynes: “Human nature desires quick results, there is a peculiar zest in making money quickly…compared with their predecessors, modern investors concentrate too much on annual, quarterly and even monthly valuations of what they hold, and on capital appreciation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — the need to do something instead of nothing.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study of soccer goalies was taken around penalty kicks. 94% of the time, the goalie’s dove left or right to block the kick. Had they stood in the center — done nothing — they would have blocked 60% of the kicks. They dove because they wanted to be seen making an effort and would have felt worse had they done nothing and missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myopia is not limited to bubbles. We love quick results. It’s why get-rich-quick schemes never go out of style. Also, we have a bias toward action and the urge to act is higher after a loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: PATIENCE! Discipline helps too. Also, trust in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Pain&lt;/strong&gt; — studies show we find it uncomfortable to go against the crowd even if the view is wrong. When we do, it can trigger emotional fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groupthink&lt;/strong&gt; — when the desire to conform is so high that the group’s decision-making suffers immensely. It spirals to the point that those with opposing views are shunned, leaving only those that share the same views. The eight symptoms of groupthink are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Illusion of Invulnerability — blind to overoptimism and extreme risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collective Rationalization — blind to confirmation bias and conservatism — discount all disconfirming evidence and fail to change their minds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belief in Inherent Morality — see their view as correct, so its morally and ethically right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stereotyped Views of Out-Groups — give negative stereotypes of all non-conforming groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct Pressure of Dissenters — vocal doubters are silenced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-Censorship — other doubters keep quiet themselves out of fear of retribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Illusion of Unanimity — views are seen as unanimous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mind Guards — confirmation bias is used as a filter to protect the group from disconfirming evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introspection Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we believe we know ourselves better than we actually do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundamental Attribution Error&lt;/strong&gt; — we tend to blame other people’s actions on their behavior while blaming our own actions on external factors.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We all want to think we’re contrarian, independent thinkers, or the exception to the rule. Being truly contrarian is difficult, not only because of conformity but because you’re guaranteed to initially look wrong while everyone else looks right (assuming you’re eventually proved right).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: courage, critical thinking, and perseverance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Steinhardt: “The hardest thing over the years has been having the courage to go against the dominant wisdom of the time, to have a view that is at variance with the present consensus and bet that view.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joel Greenblatt: “You can’t be a good value investor without being an independent thinker—you’re seeing valuations that the market is not appreciating. But it’s critical that you understand why the market isn’t seeing the value.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Graham: “If you believe that the value approach is inherently sound then devote yourself to that principle. Stick to it, and don ’t be led astray by Wall Street’s fashions, illusions and its constant chase after the fast dollar. Let me emphasize that it does not take a genius to be a successful value analyst, what it needs is, first, reasonably good intelligence; second, sound principles of operation; and third, and most important, firmness of character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss Aversion&lt;/strong&gt; — we hate losses about twice as much as we enjoy gains. Or losses loom larger than gains.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A short-term focus makes loss aversion worse, since the randomness of markets in the short term can deliver brief paper losses at anytime. Also, constantly checking your portfolio means you’re more likely to notice said paper losses. So stop constantly checking your portfolio!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disposition Effect&lt;/strong&gt; — the tendency to sell winning investments and hold on to losing investments.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terry Odean studied investor brokerage accounts. He found that investors held losing stocks longer than winning stocks, are almost twice as likely to sell winners than hold losers, and that the sold winners outperformed the held losers. Any number of biases – overoptimism, overconfidence, sunk cost, self-attribution — can be behind it. Simply, we hold on in the hopes of a recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, professional investors aren’t much better. Andrea Frazzini found that the average pros are 1.2 times as likely to sell winners than hold losers. The worst performing pros were no better than individual investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endowment Effect&lt;/strong&gt; — we put a higher value on things after we own it than before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status Quo Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we prefer things stay the same and show it by doing nothing.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believing something is worth more than the current asking price and a bias towards inactions result in a natural reluctance to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing when to sell is one of the hardest, yet most important parts of investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt; over Outcome!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Casinos have a natural advantage thanks to their process. They survive by offering games of chance that are ever so slightly tilted in their favor. They’ve built their business on a process that will win out over thousands of spins of the roulette wheel, rolls of the dice, or pulls of the slot machine. Time is a key ingredient to their process. In the short term, the casino will lose on some of those spins, rolls, or pulls. They fully expect that a few patrons will beat the odds and come out ahead. A casino’s process is built on looking “wrong” in the short term while being “right” in the long run. Doing so guarantees a good outcome in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Graham on process: “I recall to those of you who are bridge players the emphasis that bridge experts place on playing a hand right rather than on playing it successfully. Because, as you know, if you play it right you are going to make money and if you play it wrong you lose money—in the long run. There is a beautiful little story about the man who was the weaker bridge player of the husband-and-wife team. It seems he bid a grand slam, and at the end he said very triumphantly to his wife “I saw you making faces at me all the time, but you notice I not only bid this grand slam but I made it. What can you say about that?” And his wife replied very dourly, “If you had played it right you would have lost it.&quot;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So focus on the things you can control. No investment process is perfect. It will not produce good results every single time. A good process, that exploits edges, delivers bad breaks sometimes but will win out if given enough time. Good behavior is key with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcome Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we tend to judge past decisions based on the quality of the outcome rather than the quality of the decision.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every decision has four possible results: good decision/good outcome (deserved success), good decision/bad outcome (bad break), bad decision/good outcome (dumb luck), bad decision/bad outcome (poetic justice).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hyper-focus on outcomes leads to general stupidity — show higher loss aversion, embracing certainty, embrace noise, and follow the herd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge is not enough to improve behavior. Simply, knowing every behavioral bias does not equate to better behavior. Changed behavior requires changes in habits. Setting simple rules help too. Changing habits work much like compounding, small gradual improvements over time pay off in big ways. A focus on process is what produces gradual improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, focusing on process and its long-term benefits won’t necessarily help you in the short term. During periods of underperformance, the pressure always builds to change your process. However, a sound process is capable of generating poor results, just as a bad process can generate good results. Perhaps we would all do well to remember the late great Sir John Templeton’s words, “The time to reflect on your investing methods is when you are most successful, not when you are making the most mistakes, ” or indeed Ben Graham’s exultation, “The value approach is inherently sound…devote yourself to that principle. Stick to it, and don ’t be led astray.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, if we can’t invest by forecasting, how should we invest? As Ben Graham pointed out “Analysis should be penetrating not prophetic.” That is to say, analysts are called analysts, not forecasters, for a reason. All investors should devote themselves to understanding the nature of the business and its intrinsic worth, rather than wasting their time trying to guess the unknowable future. Different investors have approached the problem of forecasting in different ways. If you are wedded to the use of discounted cash flow valuations, then you may well benefit from turning the process on its head. Rather than trying to forecast the future, why not take the current market price and back out what it implies for future growth. This implied growth can then be matched against a distribution of the growth rates that all firms have managed to achieve over time. If you find yourself with a firm that is at the very limits of what previous firms have achieved, then you should think very carefully about your purchase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What can we do to defend ourselves against over-optimism? We must learn to think critically and become more skeptical. We should get used to asking ‘Must I believe this?’ rather than the far more common ‘Can I believe this?‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In fact, the illusion of control seems most likely to occur when lots of choices are available; when you have early success at the task (as per the coin tossing); the task you are undertaking is familiar to you; the amount of information is high; and you have a personal involvement. To me, these sound awfully like the conditions we encounter when investing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fear causes people to ignore bargains when they are available in the market, especially if they have previously suffered a loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors should remember bubbles are a by-product of human behavior, and human behavior is all too predictable. The details of each bubble are subtly different, but the general patterns remain eerily similar. As such, bubbles and their bursts are clearly not black swans. Of course, the timing of the eventual bursting of the bubble remains as uncertain as ever, but the patterns of the events themselves are all too predictable. As Jean Marie Eveillard observed, “Sometimes, what matters is not so much how low the odds are that circumstances would turn negative, what matters more is what the consequences would be if that happens.” In other words, sometimes the potentially long-term negative outcomes are so severe that investors simply can’t afford to ignore them, even in the short term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At a one-year time horizon, the vast majority of your total return comes from changes in valuation—which are effectively random fluctuations in price. However, at a five-year time horizon, 80 percent of your total return is generated by the price you pay for the investment plus the growth in the underlying cash flow. These are the aspects of investment that fundamental investors should understand, and they clearly only matter in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing something different from the crowd is the investment equivalent of seeking out social pain. As a contrarian investor, you buy the stocks that everyone else is selling, and sell the stocks that everyone else is buying. This is social pain. The psychological results suggest that following such a strategy is really like having your arm broken on a regular basis—not fun! Fortunately, although painful, a strategy of being contrarian is integral to successful investment. As Sir John Templeton put it, “It is impossible to produce superior performance unless you do something different from the majority,” or as Keynes pointed out “The central principle of investment is to go contrary to the general opinion on the grounds that if everyone agreed about its merits, the investment is inevitably too dear and therefore unattractive.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Greenblatt’s Little Book delivers a crash course in value investing. He covers how to view the market, why most people fail to beat the market, metrics for quality and low priced stocks, and how his Magic Formula works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market is an opportunity factory. It’s a place where you can buy a business for a lot less than its worth. Or you can sell a business for more than it’s worth. Or you can overpay and undersell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started is the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many people overlook the “importance of saving money for things that you might want or need in the future…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare every investment’s potential return against the 10-yr Treasury rate (risk-free rate of return). If other investments don’t exceed the 10-yr rate (or 6%, whichever is highest), then just own Treasuries. You’re taking an excessive risk when a better, lower risk option is available. Said another way, you must be able to earn more than the 10-yr Treasury (or 6%, whichever is highest), to make another investment worthwhile. (Greenblatt puts a hard floor at 6% (inverse of P/E 16 or 1/16) – the minimum return – whenever the 10-yr Treasury rate falls below that number.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying shares of a business entitle you to an equal share of the business’s future earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on price paid is E/P or earnings/price. But that only tells you what the business earned last year based on price. You need to know 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you think the business will earn next year — a best estimate — the same, more, or less?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How confident are you in that earnings estimate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will earnings grow after that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It boils down to attempting to measure uncertainty. More consistent businesses — smaller range in earnings from one year to the next — are easier to estimate. More erratic businesses — wider range in earnings from one year to the next — are much harder (to impossible) to estimate. The range offers a high and low estimate for potential returns to compare against a risk-free return (the conservative – low estimate – should be higher than the risk-free rate). Alternatively, consistency tends to offer less risk than inconsistent earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The range of stock prices, for individual companies, vary widely over a one-year period. The range of a stock’s 52-week high and low shows just how widely prices move in a short period of time. Over a 2 or 3 year period, the range would be even wider. Yet, we’re supposed to believe the value of these same companies move around that much too. It’s possible something drastically changed — selling much more product or much higher earnings — in the business. But it’s unlikely to be happening to every company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that? — “Well, here’s how I explain it to my students: Who knows and who cares?… The truth is that I don’t really have to know why people are willing to buy and sell shares of most companies at wildly different prices over very short periods of time. I just have to know that they do!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price paid is driven by attitudes and estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price and value are not the same thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to buy shares at a margin of safety — a big enough discount to value — to protect from losing money but also to have enough room to still make money in case your wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to predict the future. Thus, it can be hard to predict future earnings and value a business. So instead, focus on what you do know about the business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings Yield = E/P or Earnings/Price — “you would rather have a higher earnings yield than a lower one; you would rather the business earn more relative to the price you are paying than less!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on Capital — A higher return on capital is better than a low one; a company that reinvests its capital at a high rate of return is better than a company that reinvests at a low rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the two — a high earnings yield and high return on capital — you get high-quality businesses at bargain prices. Systematically investing in the two can make a lot of money. The gist of Greenblatt’s Magic Formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenblatt based the concept of his Magic Formula off Ben Graham’s net-net strategy. By buying a basket of 20-30 stocks that were cheap enough to meet Graham’s requirements, without doing additional work, the “results would be quite satisfactory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham showed that a simple system, stuck too, can achieve good returns over time. Essentially, Graham set specific rules on what type of stocks to buy, how many to buy, and when to sell. He did it in a way that, on average, bought bargains that produced “satisfactory” returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenblatt then adapted those rules to meet his high quality, bargain priced requirements and tested it. The results were good – from 1988 to 2004 his strategy earned about 30.8% per year, beating the market return of 12.3% per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The formula ranks the largest 3,500 companies by return on capital – highest to lowest – the best RoC gets #1 and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The formula ranks the largest 3,500 companies by earnings yield – highest to lowest – the best EY gets #1 and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The formula combines the two rankings – return on capital and earnings yield ranks – by adding them together. The companies are ranked by the combined total – lowest total is best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Formula ranks stocks by quality and cheapness, making sure that there will always be highly ranked stocks to invest in. It’s a relative ranking formula, meaning stocks are ranked in relation to every stock. Unlike Graham’s original formula where only stocks meeting the requirements were listed, the Magic Formula ranks every stock in relation to the entire group. As a model, there are always limits. In this case, while there will always be a ranked list of stocks, it’s possible that all the stocks ranked might, for example, be expensive (with the model showing the cheapest expensive stocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Formula doesn’t work all the time! It has periods where it underperforms the market. On average, every 5 out of 12 months it underperforms. You just don’t know which 5 months it will be. Over 5-yr periods, one of every 4 years it underperformed. The hard part is sticking with it and not second-guessing the formula during the underperforming periods. Most people quit after a losing period and chase returns somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to stick with a strategy, you must understand how and why it works. The basic principles behind it should be timeless. More important you must accept that it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the formula is systematically helping us find above-average companies that we can buy at below-average prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Formula Looks For:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above-average companies = Quality companies that can invest profits at a high rate of return (high ROIC).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Below-average prices = Bargain companies with a low share price based on earnings yield (earnings/price)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that earn a high ROIC can reinvest capital at a high rate, which can grow profits at a high rate. Companies that continue to earn a high ROIC, are candidates for some type of competitive advantage (temporary or permanent) that keeps competition from eating away at its returns. Companies without an “advantage” most likely earn a lower ROIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions to ask when thinking about risk in any strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What is the risk of losing money following that strategy over the long term?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What is the risk that your chosen strategy will perform worse than alternative strategies over the long term?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success happens over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Mr. Market is manic/depressive in the short term, you can buy and sell stocks at crazy prices. Over the long term, Mr. Market eventually get its right. It’s the short term that gets people in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, you have to wait about 2 to 3 years for Mr. Market to get it right. Buffett said something similar regarding his old Graham style investment strategy during the partnership years. This happens for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enough smart people recognize its a bargain, buy shares, and drive up the price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock buybacks lower the float (number of outstanding shares), which pushes the price higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M&amp;#x26;A, the company gets bought out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks sell at bargain prices because the view of these companies looks dim. Outlook and expectations are low, oftentimes ugly. They look less like bargains and more like trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, you’d estimate next year’s earnings and several years after to find companies with a high enough ROIC and EY. (And finding a management that can allocate capital at a high return). This is difficult. If you can’t analyze companies it’s best to take a broader approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to pick stocks, limit it to a small number of quality bargains. A concentrated group of 5 to 8 stocks in different industries can make up about 80% of the total portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Magic Formula, with its basket of stocks, shows that, on average, using last year’s earnings is a good indicator (estimate) of future earnings too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the stock market, you’re very much on your own. There’s no “tooth fairy” that magically hands out money. You need to do work to beat the market or accept average returns with index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of a solid long-term strategy — one can you stick with — combined with tax-advantaged accounts is the best way to compound your money over time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afterward covers the five year period after the 1st edition was published. The basic principles behind the Magic formula haven’t changed. Buying stocks with a margin of safety is still the most important investing concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett and Munger’s idea of buying good businesses with a margin of safety still works too. Owning businesses with a high rate of return – serial compounders – can grow value over time and increase its margin of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Formula has flaws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can underperform the market in the short term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Beating the market is not the same thing as making money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated MF returns 1988 to 2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min market cap of $50 million: 23.8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min market cap of $1 billion: 19.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S&amp;#x26;P 500: 9.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Formula is a long-only strategy. It was suggested and tested as a long/short strategy — going long the highest quality/cheapest stocks and shorting the lowest quality/expensive stocks. The long/short strategy blew up around 2000 with a 100% loss. The real benefits go to those investors who keep it as a true long-only strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the outperformance occurs when the market is moving higher — it captures 95% of the S&amp;#x26;P 500’s down months and 140% of the S&amp;#x26;P 500’s up months. (I’d explain it like this: People feel better when stocks are going up. And because they feel better, they’re willing to pay more. Alternatively, because these stocks are already “beaten down” they fall less than the overall market.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenblatt believes the principles behind the Magic Formula should work in other developed/emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenblatt admits that the Magic Formula — while it’s supposed to be simple — is not simple to manage. Just keeping track of buying and selling is difficult. Biases play a big role in that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on Capital = EBIT/(Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBIT was used because companies don’t have the same amount of debt or tax rate. It allowed for equal comparison without debt and tax rate distortions. Greenblatt assumed that EBITDA – Maintenance Capex/Expenditures = EBIT. He assumed that maintenance capex was roughly similar to depreciation and amortization charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Working Capital was used because a company has to fund receivables and inventory. Excess cash was excluded. Short term debt was excluded from current liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Fixed Assets was used because fixed assets — plant, equipment, real estate — are needed to run the business. The depreciated cost was added back into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Yield = EBIT/Enterprise Value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBIT/EV is used to find out how much the business earns in relation to the purchase price of the business. EV takes into account both the price paid and the debt used to generate operating earnings. EBIT is used for the same reason, to compare companies equally pre-tax and interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies confirm that value strategies outperform the market over time. There are several different simple measures for value: low P/B, P/E, P/FCF, P/S, and P/dividend. Most of these value measures perform best with smaller cap stocks. The Magic Formula does as well. The Magic Formula seems to outperform with large caps, where other value measures have failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Investing is hard. That’s why having a disciplined, methodical, long-term investment strategy that makes sense is essential to making it through and being successful in almost any market environment. But it can’t just make sense; it must make sense to you. Having a deep understanding is the only way to stick with a long-term strategy that might not work over shorter time periods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After more than 30 years of investing professionally and after 14 years of teaching at an Ivy League business school, I am convinced of at least two things:
If you really want to ‘beat the market,’ most professionals and academics can’t help you, and
That leaves only one real alternative: You must do it yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It takes a great amount of discipline to save any money. After all, no matter how much money you earn or receive from others, it’s simply much easier and more immediately rewarding to find something to spend it on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The big picture is that we want to make sure we earn a lot more from our other investments than we could earn without taking any risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Figuring out what a business is worth isn’t easy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It makes no sense that the values of most companies swing wildly from high to low, or low to high, during the course of each and every year. On the other hand, it seems pretty clear that the prices of the shares in most companies swing around wildly each and every year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe people simply justify high prices by making high estimates for future earnings when they are happy and justify low prices by making low estimates when they are sad.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Cohen tells the story of a Russian immigrant, Sam Zemurray, who saw an opportunity in the banana business and seized it. Along the way, he out-hustled and out-innovated the giant of the industry, United Fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray’s business life started after seeing his first banana in 1893.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three types of bananas, as far as Boston Fruit (the precursor to United Fruit) was concerned: greens, turnings, and ripes. “Boston Fruit used the following standard: one freckle, turning; two freckles, ripe,” freckles being brown spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ripes ended up in a pile at dockside. Ripes never got sold, never made it to market, tossed aside as trash, and left to spoil in the sun. Roughly, 15% of banana shipments would end in the ripe pile before refrigeration came around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing wrong with ripes was most people wanted to buy unblemished bananas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray saw his opportunity in ripes. His initial plan was to go to Mobile, Alabama, buy a pile of bananas direct from the fruit boats, and haul them back to Selma, Alabama to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took $150, all the money he had, bought a few thousand bananas (ripes), rented a partial boxcar, and began a race against time. Whether he made money or not was at the mercy of the speed of the train. He gradually sold his supply at each stop along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A train brakeman, after hearing his story, suggested he wire the towns ahead to get the word out to grocery store owners, so he could sell his product from the boxcar. Zemurray offered a Western Union telegraph operator a deal (he had no money) — wire every telegraph operator ahead and he’d share a percentage of sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His initial $150 investment after costs, came to a $40 profit — a 27% return — in 6 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Zemurray had stumbled on a niche: ripes, overlooked at the bottom of the trade. It was logistics. Could he move the product faster than the product was ruined by time? This work was nothing but stress, the margins ridiculously small (like counterfeiting dollar bills), but it was a way in. Whereas the big fruit companies monopolized the upper precincts of the industry — you needed capital, railroads, and ships to operate in greens — the world of ripes was wide open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray exploited the one area the major players refused to bother with, taking what United Fruit considered trash, and turning it into treasure. He sold 20,000 bananas in 1899, cleared over 500,000 in 1903, and passed a million within a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By his 21st birthday, 1898 (he was born in 1877), he was worth $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the late 1800s, the banana trade was booming. Like most boom times, it didn’t last. One bad year — 1899 — wiped out most of the banana crop in a series of natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons of 1899 were clear for surviving businesses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Big to Survive: A company needed enough capital reserves to survive whatever freak events mother nature threw at it (later on, it would add governments to the list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control Supply: Own the fields, control the planting, the harvesting, the labor, the governments (if necessary), the costs, the prices, and the supply during down years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversify: owning fields across multiple regions, meant a disaster in one region wouldn’t wipe out an entire supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of those lessons came United Fruit, the titan of the industry, and Zemurray’s Cayumel Fruit company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is a mere succession of fortunes made and lost, lessons learned and forgotten and learned again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1903, Zemurray signed a contract with United Fruit that gave him sole rights to all its ripes. At the time, United Fruit shipped half the bananas in the world. He would only expand from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took on a partner in 1903, Ashbell Hubbard, starting the Hubbard-Zemurray Company with $30,000, which would become Cuyamel Fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acquisition spree followed, buying up failed companies for the assets. In 1905, Hubbard-Zemurray bought Thatcher Brothers Steamships and Cuyamel Fruit Company on the cheap. Cuyamel Fruit was a gamble on land deeds in Honduras, but the boats opened the door to importing bananas himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1910, Zemurray started buying as much land as he could in Honduras for his first banana plantation, to better control his supply. It was all from borrowed money, sometimes from nefarious lenders at ridiculously high rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took full control of Cuyamel Fruit, buying Hubbard’s 45% share, giving Zemurray 90%, with United Fruit owning the 10%. Hubbard couldn’t handle the risk Zemurray was taking piling up debt to buy as much land as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Knox plan, an agreement to buy and refinance Honduran railroad bonds by J. Pierpont Morgan, jeopardized Zemurray’s plans in Honduras. The plan, if ratified would add up to a penny per bunch the Zemurray’s costs, making it impossible to stay in business. The only solution was to fund a coup via revolution, won in 1911. By 1912, Zemurray’s settlement with the new government of Honduras included duty-free imports, no taxes, a $500,000 loan to repay funds for the revolution, and 24,700 acres to be claimed later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1913, Zemurray bought back the 10% stake in Cuyamel held by United Fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray was a stickler for reputation. He believed his association with United Fruit damaged his reputation after United Fruit boycott by Nicaraguan banana growers (United Fruit used Cuyamel ships, instead of UF ships, to get around the boycott). Being totally independent was the only way to repair his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1915, he was buying up ships and adding refrigeration for more control over transportation. He also started diversifying with land — in Nicaragua and Mexico — and products — coconuts, pineapple, palm oil, cattle, timber, sugarcane — to hedge against natural disaster and market conditions. Cuyamel survived WWI thanks to sugarcane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He redeemed his Honduran land claim in 1915 — his new 24,700 acres bordered United Fruit land, putting the two companies in direct conflict. The land grab and resulting conflict would trigger a merger of the two companies 14 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1925, Cuyamel was debt free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray was a farmer at heart, preferring to be on the ground, working the plantation with the other workers. That gave him an advantage over other companies, like United Fruit, with suits who ran their companies a world away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being the small fish up against the behemoth of United Fruit, Zemurray had created a startup that could run circles around the bloated bureaucracy. He was more efficient, more innovation, more nimble, had a happier higher skilled workforce, and it all resulted in higher profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His banana innovations produced bigger, fatter, better bananas (most seem obvious today, but it is new back then and looked on as unnecessary or crazy):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selective Pruning: cut runts and dwarfs from bunches while still growing on the tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drainage: improved drainage with canals and spillways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silting: purposely flooded fields because silt made an excellent fertilizer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staking: tied trees to bamboo to protect against high winds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overhead Irrigation: watered during the dry season since rain was consistent year round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 1929, Zemurray would merge Cuyamel with United Fruit in a stock swap. Zemurray received 300,000 shares in United Fruit, valued at roughly $30 million, making him the largest shareholder in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He briefly retired from the business after the merger thanks to a standard noncompete clause. - He spent his short-lived retirement as a philanthropist (and returned to his philanthropic ways in a big way following WWII).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1932, United Fruit stock had collapsed — $100/share in 1929 were trading at $10.25 in 1932. UF management was doing everything to lower costs, save their jobs, and it threatened the companies survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray led and won a proxy fight for control of United Fruit in 1933. He went door to door talking shareholders and collecting their votes to oust management. Time reported the meeting this way: “One day last summer Samuel (“Sam”) Zemurray of New Orleans strode belligerently into a room at No. 1 Federal Street, Boston, where the directors of the potent, far-flung United Fruit Co. were holding a meeting. Down on the long table from his old enemy, President Victor Macomber Cutter, he flung a handful of proxies. Said he: “You’ve been fucking up this business long enough. I’m going to straighten it out.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would remake United Fruit in the image of Cuyamel by cutting out bureaucratic overlap and waste. He said, “I realized that the greatest mistake the United Fruit management had made was to assume it could run its activities in many tropical countries from an office on the 10th floor of a Boston office building… The management had tried to tell every executive in every country exactly what he must do and how he must do it. Executives on the spot were treated like messenger boys. I completely reversed that policy. I laid down what might be called a constitution for the company. This constitution provided for a maximum of home rule in the field. It was established as a fixed policy that if [a plantation manager] could not handle his difficulties reasonably satisfactorily, we would appoint some man who could.” He sold ships, rented space in other ships, left fields farrow to control prices, diversified into other products like sugarcane, pineapples, and quinine trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1933, sentiment on United Fruits stock was turning, the price was up to $26/share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray would lead the company until 1951. He sold all his shares of United Fruit upon retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banana Facts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The banana tree is an herb, not a tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can grow up to 20 inches in a day in perfect conditions, up to 30 feet tall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s the largest plant without a woody trunk, that grows from a rhizome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bananas — the fruit — come at the end of a cycle. It can bear fruit year round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bananas are a type of berry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trees only bear fruit (i.e. berries — bananas) in the tropics, with two exceptions — Iceland, on a volcano’s slope, and Israel, for a yet unknown reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rhizome, much like a potato, can be divided up and replanted to grow more banana trees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no seeds. To get more trees, you split the rhizome and replant each cutting. In that sense, each rhizome cutting is a clone of the primary tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rhizome cuttings — the cloning — are its great strength and weakness from a business perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strength: cheap, low-cost production growth with total uniformity between plants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness: highly susceptible to disease. Since every banana tree is a clone, if one tree is susceptible, all species of that type are susceptible. There’s also poor weather (natural disasters) to deal with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Big Mike was the first species of banana to be imported on a mass scale and the first to be wiped out by disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cavendish species is currently the mass import and also battling extinction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United Fruit Facts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also known as El Pulpo, the Octopus, because its tentacles reached everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founded in 1885, as Boston Fruit, by Lorenzo Baker, Andrew Preston, and 10 other investors who put up about $1,500 each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 1897, Boston Fruit had $4 million in assets and couldn’t keep up with demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boston Fruit turned bananas into a volume business. Low prices were key to sales and lack of supply risked higher prices — the only way to control prices was to get much bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 1899 — the worst year for bananas — Boston Fruit controlled 75% of the market. And it wasn’t big enough. It needed to diversify across different regions to protect itself from a repeat of 1899.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On March 30, 1899, United Fruit was born. Boston Fruit merged with Keith Minor’s Tropical Trading &amp;#x26; Transport Company, giving the company $20 million, 212,349 acres across 6 countries, and 184,000 unsold shares to entice independent companies to join United Fruit. 27 small companies seized on the offer of security with United Fruit in the first 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United Fruit purposely kept its ownership in the independent banana companies to 49%, to avoid anti-trust concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 1908, it shipped 60% of all bananas to the US, 36 million stems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first anti-trust lawsuit against United Fruit reached the Supreme Court in 1909 and failed. Too much of United Fruit’s business, being done overseas, couldn’t be judged by US law alone. The majority opinion in a nutshell: local law (non-US) allowed it so it wasn’t unlawful. Any other decision would have had an unknown ripple effect across multiple countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 1910, the company owned 115 ships (one of the largest navies in the world) that carried not only bananas but mail and cargo of Central America. The company had the power to control the region just by shutting down the ships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1929 merger with Cuyamel Fruit, gave United Fruit 68% market share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company would hit its peak around 1940, under Zemurray’s leadership, with a workforce of 100,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United Fruit orchestrated a successful coup (under Zemurray) in Guatemala, with the backing of the US government, in 1954. It triggered the beginning of the end for the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“At the time of the coup, U.F. led its industry by every measure: in profits, market share, volume (and it wasn’t even close). Within a generation, it would trail Standard Fruit in nearly every category. The overthrow had all the ingredients of irony: meant to prevent the establishment of a Communist beachhead in the hemisphere, it would help create just such a beachhead in Cuba. Meant to make Guatemala friendly for the company, it would engender such hostility that the company was eventually forced to abandon the isthmus altogether.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antitrust laws hit the company again in 1958. The company lost. The agreed settlement would create a competitor at 1/3 the size of UF in Guatemala. UF would have to sell 33% of its assets to an independent company — Del Monte, #3 in market share, became the buyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It dropped out of first place in market share within a few years and the company would spiral from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“A corporation ages like a person. As the years go by and the founders die off, making way for the bureaucrats of the second and third generations, the ecstatic, risk-taking, just-for-the-hell-of-it spirit that built the company gives way to a comfortable middle age. Where the firm had been forward-looking and creative, it becomes self-conscious in the way of a man, pestering itself with dozens of questions before it can act. How will it look? What will they say? If the business is wealthy and strong, the executives who come to power in these later generations will be characterized by the worst kind of self-confidence: they think the money will always be there because it always has been.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The company brain is hardwired. Which is why a corporation, though conceivably immortal, tends to have a life span, tends to age and die. Unless remade by a new generation of pioneers—in which case it’s a different company—most corporations do not outlive the era of their first success. When the ideas and assumptions prevalent at the time of their founding go out of fashion, the company fades.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Zemurray had stumbled on a niche: ripes, overlooked at the bottom of the trade. It was logistics. Could he move the product faster than the product was ruined by time? This work was nothing but stress, the margins ridiculously small (like counterfeiting dollar bills), but it was a way in. Whereas the big fruit companies monopolized the upper precincts of the industry — you needed capital, railroads, and ships to operate in greens — the world of ripes was wide open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is a mere succession of fortunes made and lost, lessons learned and forgotten and learned again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogle’s Enough draws from a lifetime of wisdom to reflect on the excesses of a financial system that led to the 2008 crisis and reminds readers of the benefits of a less greedy, long-term, client-first system (society) where success in life is defined by more than just money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, “Yes, but I have something he will never have…enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Return to Investors = Gross Return – Costs/Fees. The financial system siphons (or skims) the top of the returns earned by investors, businesses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On balance, the financial system subtracts value from our society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most money-making activity contains profoundly antisocial effects… As high-cost modality become ever more popular…the activity exacerbates the current harmful trend in which ever more of the nation’s ethical young brain-power is attracted into lucrative money-management and its attendant modern frictions, as distinguished from work providing much more value to others.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advice for those in finance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If you enter the financial field, do so with your eyes wide open, recognizing that any endeavor that extracts value from its clients may, in times more troubled than these, find that it has been hoist by its own petard. It is said on Wall Street, correctly, that “money has no conscience,” but don’t allow that truism to let you ignore your own conscience, nor to alter your own conduct and character.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“When you begin to invest so that you have enough for your own retirement many decades hence, do so in a way that minimizes the extraction by the financial community of the returns generated by business.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“No matter what career you choose, do your best to hold high its traditional professional values, no swiftly eroding, in which serving the client is always the highest priority. And don’t ignore the greater good of your community, your nation, and your world.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic of compounding works on costs, as well as returns. The higher the cost, the lower the return. Here’s an example: A $1,000 initial investment 50 years ago at 11% per year, would grow to $184,600. Of course, that’s before fees. A 2% fee per year, drops the net annual return down to 9% on that initial $1,000 investment and produces just $74,400. Now add 1.5% to cover income tax and capital gains every year — cutting the return down to 7.5% per year —  and the final total is $37,000. 80% of the total return is eaten by costs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect costs to rise if your strategy is more speculation than investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is my basic thesis — for the future as for the past — that an intelligent and well-trained financial analyst can do a useful job as portfolio adviser for many different kinds of people, and thus amply justify his existence. Also I claim he can do this by adhering to relatively simple principles of sound investment; e.g., a proper balance between stocks and bonds; proper diversification; selection of a representative list; discouragement of speculation operations not suited for the client’s financial position or temperament — and for this he does not need to be a wizard in picking winners from the stock list or in foretelling market improvements.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial System is not all bad. It does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitate optimal capital allocation for users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable efficient introduction of buyers and sellers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide ease of liquidity for assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow investors to capitalize or acquire future cash flows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow investors to take additional risk or hedge risk through numerous financial instruments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bogle wonders if the cost of the benefits above exceeds the benefits themselves. Do investors get what they pay for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investing is all about the long-term ownership of businesses… Speculation is precisely the opposite. It is all about the short-term trading, not long-term holding, of financial instruments — pieces of paper, not businesses — largely focused on the belief that their prices, as distinct from intrinsic values will rise; indeed, an expectation that the prices of the stocks that are selected will rise more than other stocks, as the expectations of other investors rise to match one’s own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most that owners in the aggregate can earn between now and Judgment Day is what their business in the aggregate earns.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation driven by emotion produces short-term volatility and opportunities for the patient long-term investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stock market is a giant distraction from the business of investing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average turnover rate for stocks was about 25% in 1951 and stayed there for the next two decades. Then it gradually rose to over 100% by 1998 and 215% by 2007. Turnover = number of shares traded as a percentage of shares outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the value of futures and options derivatives of the S&amp;#x26;P 500 Index totaled $29 trillion. The value of the companies in the S&amp;#x26;P 500 at the time was $13 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whenever stock prices lose touch with corporate values and bubbles begin to form, too many market participants seem to anticipate that values will soon rise to justify prices, instead of the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation encourages investors “to ignore the inevitable even as they discount the probability of the improbable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising speculation increases the chance of anything happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In financial markets, the improbable is, in fact, highly probable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Placing large bets on an unknown future is worse than gambling because at least in gambling you know the odds. Most of the decisions in life motivated by greed have unhappy outcomes.” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market timing is hard, if not impossible, to make money consistently. It requires being right twice: in getting out and getting back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, simplicity has always been the key to successful investing, and the time-honored wisdom of Occam’s razor…has stood me in good stead: When confronted with multiple solutions to a problem, choose the simplest one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, financial institutions and investors tend to choose complex solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial innovation revolves around complex products because it brings with it higher fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fund companies consistently create new funds to take advantage of the fad of the day, then charge a high fee for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors favor complex products because they believe complex works better than simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors in new fad funds often underperform the fund itself and a simpler broad market index fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Thanks to the innovation and creativity of fund sponsors — and surely the greed (or perceived need) of fund investors — the return that mutual fund investors received on their hard-earned capital was less than a third of the return offered by the stock market itself.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fad funds have a higher than average failure rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3,165 of the 6,125 funds that existed in 2001, were gone by 2008. Of the 4,356 equity funds, 2,314 fund managers failed to invest in the fund they managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are three i‘s in every cycle: first the innovator, then the imitator, and finally the idiot.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First principles: Commodities have no internal rate of return. Their prices are based entirely on supply and demand. That is why they are considered speculations, and rank speculations at that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In economics and finance, we place too much trust in numbers. Numbers are not reality. At best, they are a pale reflection of reality. At worst, they’re a gross distortion of the truths we seek to measure… Not only do we rely too heavily on historic economic and market data; our optimistic bias also leads us to misinterpret the data and give them credence that they rarely merit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the only valid prism through which to view the market’s future is the one that takes into account not history, but the sources of stock returns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on historical returns ignores the sources of those returns. Those sources being earnings growth, dividend yield, and a speculative element that moves price multiples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEOs and analysts fail at forecasting business growth. It’s almost always too optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1929, average after-tax profits grew at a 5.6% rate. GDP grew at a 6.6% rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&amp;#x26;A activity often creates fees for the finance system and costs shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When investors are focused, not on the intrinsic value of the corporation, but on the price of its stock, assuming some responsibility for corporate governance is the first casualty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, average CEO pay was 42x the average worker’s pay. By 2004, it was 280x the average workers. Adjusted for inflation, the average worker’s income rose 0.3% per year. The average - CEOs income rose 8.5% per year. In fact, CEO pay outpaced corporate profit growth (corporate profits, in real terms, grew at 2.9%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders rarely hold management accountable. Ben Graham complained about it in the 1940s and it hasn’t changed must since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average mutual fund investors held shares for 16 years in 1951. The average holding period was down to 4 years in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average stock in the average mutual fund in 1951 was held for six years. By 2008, that holding period was down to one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average expense ratio of the average mutual fund doubled from 1951 to 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogle’s “dreams” for the fund industry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give every investor a fair shake on costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve the investors for a lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on long-term investment strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve long-term investors (today’s clients are tomorrow’s clients too).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push corporate governance that’s in the best interest of investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogle’s Rules to Building a Great Organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make caring the soul of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget about employees (he wanted “crew members,” committed people linked together as part of a greater whole)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set high standards and values — stick to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk the talk — repeat the values endlessly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk the walk — Actions speak louder…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t overmanage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize individual achievement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loyalty is a two-way street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead/manage for the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press on, regardless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the original Fortune 500 companies, first published in 1955, only 71 still exist. Of the 2000+ that have made the list at some point, most are gone. Few companies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have had cause enough to know that the road to life is rarely smooth and that we need to be prepared for the inevitable reversals in our fortunes, whether constituted by wealth, or health, or family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowledge is not the personal property of its discoverer, but the common property of all. As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours, and this we should do freely and generously.” — Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Franklin began each day with the question, “What good shall I do this day?” and ended each day with the question, “What good have I done today?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it perhaps often in this history; for even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.” — Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have come to recognize that wealth is ill measured by mere dollars, that fame is ill measured by public accolades, and that power is ill measured solely by control over others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Success, in short, can be measured not in what we attain for ourselves, but in what we contribute to our society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man is incapable of comprehending any argument that interferes with his revenue.” — Rene Descartes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is moved along, not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker.” — Helen Keller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogle saved 15% of his salary, since 1951, toward retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worried about excessive speculation in the market in 1999, Bogle reduced his equity holdings to 35%, raising bond holdings to 65%. Otherwise, he focused on a balanced allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you plan your financial future, don’t fool yourself by focusing on the nominal gross returns on stocks and bonds; subtract the costs you expect to be assessed, and work with net returns. Then assume that even those returns will be reduced by inflation. Set realistic goals that you can reasonably expect to achieve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When investors are focused, not on the intrinsic value of the corporation, but on the price of its stock, assuming some responsibility for corporate governance is the first casualty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First principles: Commodities have no internal rate of return. Their prices are based entirely on supply and demand. That is why they are considered speculations, and rank speculations at that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In economics and finance, we place too much trust in numbers. Numbers are not reality. At best, they are a pale reflection of reality. At worst, they’re a gross distortion of the truths we seek to measure… Not only do we rely too heavily on historic economic and market data; our optimistic bias also leads us to misinterpret the data and give them credence that they rarely merit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the only valid prism through which to view the market’s future is the one that takes into account not history, but the sources of stock returns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are three i‘s in every cycle: first the innovator, then the imitator, and finally the idiot.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thanks to the innovation and creativity of fund sponsors — and surely the greed (or perceived need) of fund investors — the return that mutual fund investors received on their hard-earned capital was less than a third of the return offered by the stock market itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In financial markets, the improbable is, in fact, highly probable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Placing large bets on an unknown future is worse than gambling because at least in gambling you know the odds. Most of the decisions in life motivated by greed have unhappy outcomes.” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whenever stock prices lose touch with corporate values and bubbles begin to form, too many market participants seem to anticipate that values will soon rise to justify prices, instead of the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stock market is a giant distraction from the business of investing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most that owners in the aggregate can earn between now and Judgment Day is what their business in the aggregate earns.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investing is all about the long-term ownership of businesses… Speculation is precisely the opposite. It is all about the short-term trading, not long-term holding, of financial instruments — pieces of paper, not businesses — largely focused on the belief that their prices, as distinct from intrinsic values will rise; indeed, an expectation that the prices of the stocks that are selected will rise more than other stocks, as the expectations of other investors rise to match one’s own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is my basic thesis — for the future as for the past — that an intelligent and well-trained financial analyst can do a useful job as portfolio adviser for many different kinds of people, and thus amply justify his existence. Also I claim he can do this by adhering to relatively simple principles of sound investment; e.g., a proper balance between stocks and bonds; proper diversification; selection of a representative list; discouragement of speculation operations not suited for the client’s financial position or temperament — and for this he does not need to be a wizard in picking winners from the stock list or in foretelling market improvements.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you enter the financial field, do so with your eyes wide open, recognizing that any endeavor that extracts value from its clients may, in times more troubled than these, find that it has been hoist by its own petard. It is said on Wall Street, correctly, that “money has no conscience,” but don’t allow that truism to let you ignore your own conscience, nor to alter your own conduct and character.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you begin to invest so that you have enough for your own retirement many decades hence, do so in a way that minimizes the extraction by the financial community of the returns generated by business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No matter what career you choose, do your best to hold high its traditional professional values, no swiftly eroding, in which serving the client is always the highest priority. And don’t ignore the greater good of your community, your nation, and your world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, “Yes, but I have something he will never have…enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On balance, the financial system subtracts value from our society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most money-making activity contains profoundly antisocial effects… As high-cost modality become ever more popular…the activity exacerbates the current harmful trend in which ever more of the nation’s ethical young brain-power is attracted into lucrative money-management and its attendant modern frictions, as distinguished from work providing much more value to others.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Davis Dynasty is a story about Shelby Collum Davis and his family. The author mixes Davis’s story of how, over a 47-year investing career, he made a fortune with the market history he experienced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes are based on an abridged version of The Davis Dynasty (a few chapters were cut from the original) which was given out to fund shareholders back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby Cullom Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was born in 1909.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His success in investing came later in life. He started in his late 30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He bought a seat in the NYSE in 1941 for $33,000. Davis thought it was a great deal. 12 years early (1929), seats sold for $629,000! A year after his purchase, seats sold for half what he paid, but eventually rallied over the next few years. It grew to $830,000 in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis was extremely frugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis used leveraged in his portfolio. He noticed how mortgages (leverage) boosted net worth via real estate ownership over time. He believed leverage applied stocks had more profit potential than a mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis took a contrarian stance and embraced stocks fully. In 1947, the Dow traded at 9.6x earnings, with a 5% average dividend yield while bonds offered historic low rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis’s timing was nearly perfect. He started a few years before the post-war boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He focused on analyzing insurance companies because that’s what he knew best. He began his career working for the state’s insurance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance stocks were severely depressed because earnings were nonexistent due to low bonds yields. Most sold below book value but paid a high dividend. Davis saw it as an opportunity with limited downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance companies were compounding machines. Low cost to run, no factories to upgrade or high Capex costs each year. Just an increasing marginal cost that comes with a growing customer base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He quit the state’s insurance department in 1948, bought an interest in a brokerage firm (Frank Brokaw &amp;#x26; Co.), renamed it Shelby Cullom Davis &amp;#x26; Co., and promoted insurance stocks to anyone who would listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He began to heed his own advice around 1948 and started buying insurance stocks himself. His firm’s underwriting and brokerage operations became secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis had 2 advantages over the average investors because of his firm and NYSE seat. He could buy more shares on margin. His firm could borrow more money than an individual investor. And his firm paid a lower interest rate on margin loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis regularly visited insurance companies to meet with management. His favorite question: “If you had one silver bullet to shoot a competitor, which competitor would you shoot?” Then he’d research that competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked for greater leadership in management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked for low-cost operators in the industry and avoided the underachievers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His early portfolio was mostly in small-cap insurers that traded OTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saw his portfolio fall by $125 million in the 1987 crash but saw it as a buying opportunity. He went on a buying spree. The next year he made Forbes 400 list with a “lowball” estimated net worth of $370 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis Double Play: low-priced stocks with the potential for above-average earnings growth. Investors buy at a low multiple, get exceptional earnings growth, and then see multiples expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Davis’s financial life had three phases: learn, earn, and return. The learn phase lasted into his early forties, and the earn phase stretched from his forties into his late seventies. At that point, he tackled the return phase.” Return phase = philanthropy.  Davis died in 1994 leaving $900 million to personal causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1992, 100 insurance companies made up 75% of his portfolio, with the rest spread across 1,500 companies (including a few hundred losers). Davis had a habit of buying 1,000 shares anytime a company appealed to him. And he just rarely sold. “The printout left no doubt what had put Davis on the Forbes list. It wasn’t a phone book list of stocks; it was a few names in the phone book. These were oldies from the 1960s that he had faithfully held… Davis remained loyal. Names he owned in 1950 still occupied his portfolio in 1990.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis Dozen: 12 stocks accounted for a quarter of his total worth — $261 million — 11 were insurers plus Fannie Mae. All were bought before the mid-1970s. “He won this prize on the original cash outlay of $150,000. The prize required a 50-year waiting period to accumulate… Once he’d bought winning companies his best decisions were never to sell. As long as he believed in the strength of the leadership and the company’s continual ability to compound, he held.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was born in 1938.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He learned under his father, from “stock talk” at the dinner table, and by helping his dad make copies of a biweekly insurance letter starting around the age of 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early lessons from his father included the benefits of being a stockholder over a bondholder and compounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He learned the mistake of buying high-priced growth stocks and being sold by management after recommending Reynolds Aluminum a “buy” in 1960 when it was selling at 40x earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked for companies with potential for earnings growth and/or multiple expansion (low multiples was not a requirement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked for industries with changing characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early positions in the fund were in tech. The fund was up 25% the first year. Saw $55 million in inflows by the first quarter of 1970. Then the market crashed. Their holding fell in price after bad earnings reports. A position in Memorex dropped from $168 to $20 (were they sold after buying more on the way down!) It was a bottom 10% fund based on performance in 1970. It was a tough lesson learned that led to looking for undervalued opportunities too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ran the New York Venture fund until 1997. He beat the S&amp;#x26;P 16 out of 20 years and by 4.7% annualized over that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owner Earnings: the amount of reward pocketed each year after a company reinvests cash to maintain the status quo, but before reinvesting for growth and adjusted for stock options, depreciation, amortization, and deferred taxes. Owner earnings are almost always lower than reported earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much to pay for a company — compare the owner earnings yield to Treasury rates. Divide owner earnings by stock price to get yield. A $20 stock with $2 of owner earnings, yields 10% ($2/$20). A $70 stock with $2 of owner earnings, yields 2.9% ($2/$70). The smart investment goes to the higher of: owner earnings yield or Treasury rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market History&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign investors poured gobs of money into early U.S. railroad projects in the mid-1800s, leaving them with big losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynes called the low-interest rates of the 1940s the “balm and sweet simplicity of no percent.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enthusiasm for bonds hit a peak in the 1940s (the disdain for stocks was high). Rates on long-term Treasuries bottomed at 2% in 1946. It would kick off a 34-year bond bear market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1946 Federal Reserve Board survey showed 90% said they would not own stocks. The masses held a “collective grudge against the market.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The late 1960s kicked off a growth fund craze. Momentum-driven stocks soared. Electronics were hot stocks. The Nifty-Fifty were viewed as never sell stocks. Investors became performance chasers, moving in and out of the top mutual funds. Buffett closed his partnership in 1969 and bought municipal bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Nifty Fifty lessons:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only 3 Nifty Fifty stocks went on to grow earnings at 15% or more through 2000 — Philip Morris, McDonald’s, and Merck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study by Twentieth Century Fund found that blindly owning the entire market from 1960 to 1968 was more rewarding than paying a fund manager to pick stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1969 ended the bull market. It continued falling into 1970. Both inflation and recession existed — stagflation. Dow down 36%. Hot stocks and electronics got killed, down 77% on average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the bear market of 1973-’74, stocks still looked cheap in ’76. Buffett said he felt like an oversexed teenager at a dance hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1979 — stocks were priced for terrible news, selling at single-digit P/E’s and less than book value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1980s — the Fed fights inflation. Prime rates rose to 20.5% and 30-yr Treasuries hit 15% (bond deal of the century which few people bought). The average investor couldn’t see past high inflation to notice a great deal of 15% Treasuries. Investors are always too focused on short-term worries to recognize long-term opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold and silver prices soared in 1980. The high demand and fear buying dropped off after gold bugs predicted higher prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1981 — recession and the Dow fell 24%. The last bear market before a 20-year bull run. Inflation subsided, Fed cut rates, commodity prices fell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The late 1980s — Reagan added $1 trillion in new debt. Low rates drove consumer/corporate borrowing and overpaying on assets. Mike Milken led the junk bond frenzy, the famous Predator’s Ball, leveraged buyouts and hostile takeovers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1980s brought trading back in vogue. Newsletters popped up to profit off the fad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1987 crash — Dow lost 23% on Black Monday. A 36% drop from the high that year. Doom and gloom pundits called for further losses. They were wrong. Despite the crash, the 1987 market ended slightly positive for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1991 — recession. Banks had trouble due to the high debt of the ’80s. Citicorp was too big to fail in the late ’80s. Japan in the ’90s was like the US in the ’30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The similarity between the late ’60s and ’90s: ’69 was computer peripherals, mainframes, and electronics companies. The ’90s were Dotcoms, chip makers, networking, and connectivity. All were high P/E stocks which everyone was buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1920s, the 1960s, and 1990s were each high P/E market crash events. About 30 years between each one, roughly one generation removed, and enough time to forget each prior blowout and bust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Graham issued a market excess warning in the ’60s. Buffett did it in the ’90s. The Fed called market exuberance each time too – William McChesney Martin in ’65 and Alan Greenspan on Dec. 5, 1996. Both markets continued higher for 4 more years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s again drove high debt use, this time by consumers. People borrowed to pay bills, borrowed against homes to buy stuff, which doesn’t make debt work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s — like each boom before it, only short-term performance mattered to investors, media, and pundits. Mutual funds were graded based on their performance over 6 months or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative accounting pops up in boom times. It happened in ’69 and late ’90s (saw it in ’08 too), where some “companies were fluffing the books to meet Street expectations and create an illusion of predictable success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett called the 1999 top. Most people were buying the market at 50x earnings after fees (Fortune 500 companies were selling at $10 trillion, on $300 billion of earnings, minus the 1% fees or $100 billion, gives a payoff of $200 billion). Buffett said the market had to sell off slowly or quickly or stay flat until earnings caught up. It couldn’t rise further without violating the laws of financial gravity. $3 trillion valuation on $200 billion is reasonable, not $10 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Davis Tenets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid cheap stocks: it’s cheap for a reason, likely because it’s a poor company. Even if it turns around, it takes longer than most expect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid expensive stocks: great companies may be expensively priced but should be bought at sensible prices. “No business is attractive at any price.” — Shelby Davis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy moderately priced stocks with moderate growth: find companies with growth rates faster than the multiples — leads to earnings growth and multiple growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait until the price is right: bear markets are buying opportunities and can happen market-wide, industry-wide, or to individual stocks. “Bear markets make people a lot of money, they just don’t know it at the time.” — Shelby Cullom Davis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t fight progress: carefully choosing tech companies, with real earnings and franchises, lets you profit off dramatic changes in the economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in a theme: were the “top-down” theme influences were to look for “bottom-up” value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let your winners ride: “I was comfortable owning a stock through two or three recessions, or market cycles. That way, I learned how the company handled bad times, as well as good times.” — Shelby Davis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bet on superior management: never buy anything without assessing leadership. It may pay to follow great leaders that move to new companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore the rear-view mirror: “The most valuable lesson to learn from history on Wall Street is that history doesn’t exactly repeat itself.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay the course: investing is a marathon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Venture Fund Stock Checklist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-class management with a track record of honesty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovative research used to the company’s maximum advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operates home and abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sells products/services unlikely to become obsolete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High insider ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High returns on investor capital and management that rewards investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-cost producer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holds dominant/growing market share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History of being good at M&amp;#x26;A — makes acquisitions more profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s unrealistic to expect companies to grow at 15 percent for extended periods. Most great companies can’t do it. People who pay high prices for stocks, based on high growth assumptions, are asking for trouble up the line.” — Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Owning some of the finest companies in the world was a lousy deal if you overpaid and a worse deal if you bought the most expensive Nifties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fast growth in the latest emerging phenom doesn’t necessarily mean fat profits for foreign enthusiasts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’d be crazy to own a business that yields 3.3% instead of a 6% bond, unless the business can increase its earnings yield in the future. In other words, it must be able to grow. The challenge is to project the growth out eight or ten years. For any projection to be close to the mark, the business must be relatively predictable. You can’t pin a ten-year forecast on the typical tech company. Even if you buy tech at a relatively cheap price, it can take years before the return on the stock matches the return on a bond.” — Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our best bear protection is buying companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, real earnings, and powerful franchises. These companies can survive bad times and eventually become more dominant as weaker competitors are forced to cut back or shut down.” — Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re deploying cash today, hoping to get more cash back in the future. That’s all investing is. For us, the whole process hinges on two questions: What kind of businesses to buy, and how much to pay for them? To answer question one: A company worth buying makes more money than it spends. Its profit is recycled for maximum shareholder benefits. The second question, the price tag, is often ignored.” — Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Owning shares in a successful company is far more rewarding than owning its bonds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you know the rate of return on your investment, the Rule of 72 tells you how long it will take to double your money. The greater the return, the faster the compounding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line on this portfolio is: A few big winners are what count in a lifetime of investing, and these winners need many years to appreciate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any young, inexperienced investor has a built-in advantage over a mature sophisticated investor: Time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For maximum compounding, stocks can be held indefinitely, while bonds outperform intermittently.” — Peter Lynch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Great investing requires an independent spirit, and the courage to acquire assets the crowd disdains.” — Peter Lynch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of my most rewarding investments came from slow-growth industries where expectations were low and profits lackluster. By looking for the most inspiring competitors in uninspiring lines of work, I often found great growth enterprises priced for mediocrity.” — Peter Lynch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve all heard that people who are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat it. On Wall Street, history repeats itself routinely, as corrections and bear markets turn into bull markets sooner or later. Investors who are ignorant of this pattern aren’t necessarily doomed, but they are likely to lose money trying to escape stocks at inopportune moments.” — Peter Lynch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My father hated taxes, so margin became his favorite weapon against the IRS. The interest he paid on his loans was tax-deductible, and his deductions wiped out the taxes he’d otherwise have owed on the dividends he got. Also, by raising the stakes on his investing, margin kept him focused.” — Shelby Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Out of crisis comes opportunity. A down market lets you buy more shares in great companies at favorable prices. If you know what you’re doing, you’ll make most of your money from these periods. You just won’t realize it until much later.” — Shelby Cullom Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where is the incentive if children and grandchildren start out with a trust fund which guarantees they never had to work?… I believe in providing a “safety net” in case of emergency but, predominantly, I believe in the incentive to excel…and contribute to the common good.” — Shelby Collum Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Philosophy and theology give you the perfect background for investing. To succeed at investing, you need a philosophy. Then you’ve got to pray like hell.” — Shelby Collum Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On writing his insurance newsletter: “It’s not for the readers. It’s for us. We write it for ourselves. Putting ideas on paper forces you to think things through.” — Shelby Collum Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On insurance earnings: “New life insurance sales built future prosperity while resulting in continuously reporting short-term losses, because commissions and marketing costs were deducted from earnings up front. An insurance policy that brought income to the company for the next 30 to 40 years went on the books as a debit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buffett Partnership Letters are classic reading for any value investor. Readers get an inside view of Warren Buffett’s investment philosophy — seeing where it did and did not evolve — early in his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1957 to 1968, the Buffett Partnership earned a 31.6% annual return (25.3% for limited partners), with no losing years, compared to 9.1% for the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett saw a satisfactory return as one that beat the Dow by 10% over the long term. And if he could not beat the Dow, it was best for the partners to invest through someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His goal was to outperform in bear markets with average performance in bull markets — targeting a half percent decline for each 1% decline in the Dow. He constantly reminded the partners of it — tempered their expectations — every time he handily beat the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He favored a conservative approach, avoiding permanent capital loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 years is his minimum time needed to judge good performance (5 years is better), assuming the period saw both strong and weak markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At all times, I attempt to have a portion of our portfolio in securities as least partially insulated from the behavior of the market, and this portion should increase as the market rises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett’s Fees: one-fourth of profits above 6% per year, with any year falling short of 6% in profits would be carried forward against future profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexes are tough competition to beat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett annually compared four of the largest mutual funds at the time against the Dow: “I present this data to indicate the Dow as an investment competitor is no pushover, and the great bulk of investment funds in the country are going to have difficulty in bettering, or perhaps even matching, its performance.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of outperformance from the funds was due, in his opinion, to a combination of group decisions making it harder to come to a consensus decision, desire to conform (herd mentality) to what other funds are doing, that average performance is safer than the risk of being different, broad diversification, and inertia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That said, Buffett does see a benefit in mutual funds despite their lack of alpha — ease of use, freedom from decision making, automatic diversification, and a better alternative than the speculative trouble an investor can get into on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of a portfolio can help or hurt returns depending on how its invested — helpful in control situations, hurtful in passive investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conservative portfolio is measured by how well it performs in a bear market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good or bad performance should be measured against a benchmark(s), not by gains or losses in a year. Investors should objectively evaluate their performance against that benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I can and do promise is that: Our investments will be chosen on the basis of value, not popularity; that we will attempt to bring risk of permanent capital loss (not short-term quotational loss) to an absolute minimum by obtaining a wide margin of safety in each commitment and a diversity of commitments…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joys of Compounding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume the voyage of Columbus had been underwritten with $30,000 in venture capital. Had the money been invested differently, say at 4% compounded annually to the present (i.e. 1962), Spain would have watched it grow to $2 trillion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume Francis I of France paid $20,000 for Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa in 1540. Had he instead invested the money at 6% compounded annually (after-tax, of course), his estate would worth $1 quadrillion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manhattan was sold in 1626 to Peter Minuit for the rough equivalent of $24. Who got the better deal? A 1965 appraisal, at $20 per square foot puts the value at $12.5 billion. But had the Indians invested that $24 at 6.5%, it would be worth $42 billion over the same time. If they got a half point better — 7% instead — they’d have $205 billion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservative investing is not the same as conventional investing. There are times when a conservative approach means being conventional — investing like everyone else — but there will also be times when a conservative approach means being unconventional. Conservative investing is not about seeking agreement with others but making a proper assessment of many situations while maintaining the primary goal of avoiding the temporary and permanent loss of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of investing is to earn the best after-tax return possible, which is not the same as paying the lowest amount of taxes. Holding on to investments to avoid paying taxes is often at odds with earning the best after-tax return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing is about probabilities and expectations which results can diverge from in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Position Sizing: He based it on the probability that an investment might result in worse relative performance to the Dow. Given two stocks with the same expected returns, the one with the lower probability of performing worse than the Dow gets the higher weighting in the portfolio. Overall weighting is determined by how tiny the probability can get. He was willing to go as high as 40% in any one position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of 1967 was the first time Buffett complained about finding a lack of good opportunities. He questioned whether it was due to a change in the market environment, portfolio size, or more competition. He refused to invest outside his comfort zone, or chase the popular tech stock craze of the late ’60s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of 1967, Buffett said it was no longer possible for him to beat the Dow by 10% due to the late ’60s market behavior (he changed it to 5% over the Dow or 9%, whichever is lower). He saw a “distortion of a sound idea” — a shift in focus from long term performance to short term performance, leading to speculation in order to achieve the highest returns possible in the shortest amount of time. Buffett wasn’t willing to change his strategy to something he didn’t understand just to compete against the Go-Go funds. He would rather pass on the large, easy profits because of the risk of large capital losses that came with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1967 was the first time he floated the possibility of retiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Quantitative vs. Qualitative Analysis: both approaches can be used to make money. Investors who prefer one or the other, likely combine the two to some extent. Buffett considers himself of the quantitative type, but said his best ideas were qualitative — only when he had a “high probability insight.” But those insights are rare. The quantitative side needs no insight — the numbers are either obvious or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better to work with quality management that earn a decent return than chase a few percentage points higher returns by working with horrible management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommended partners read The &lt;a href=&quot;/money-game-summary&quot;&gt;Money Game&lt;/a&gt; in 1968.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go-Go Fund manager on investing in 1968: “The complexities of national and international economics make money management a full-time job. A good money manager cannot maintain a study of securities on a week-by-week or even a day-by-day basis. Securities must be studied in a minute-by-minute program.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett announced his retirement in the May 1969 letter and offered a plan to liquate the partnership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommended partners invest with Bill Ruane — Buffett’s classmate in Ben Graham’s class at Columbia — after the partnership liquidation. He earned similar returns to the partnership with more volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy bonds like you would stocks — only invest in what you understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bond maturity: selection should be based on the shape of yield curve, the expectation of future interest rates (most difficult to assess), and the ability to stomach price fluctuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio Construction:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generals:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undervalued securities, with a wide margin of safety, no view on corporate policy or when price appreciation might occur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bargain price is a must, but also good management or new management in a decent industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He likes to see companies with improving earnings/increasing asset values, that the market hasn’t recognized yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s the largest portion of the portfolio with the best total returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual position size: 5% – 10% for each of 5 or 6 generals, with small positions in 10-15 others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More concerned about buying at the right price then selling at the best price — squeezing the last penny out of a deal. He was happy selling below fair value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to move with the market — performing well in rising markets, poorly in declining markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 1964 letter, he split Generals into two groups: “Private Owner Basis” and “Relatively Undervalued.” The “Private Owner Basis” were the typical Generals as described above. The “Relatively Undervalued” were securities selling cheap relative to other similar securities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workouts (i.e. Special Situations):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are dependent on a specific corporate action or event in order to profit, making it easier to predict when and how much could be earned, and the risk of it falling through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually the result of corporate sales, spinoffs, mergers, liquidations, tenders, reorganizations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk is that something — anti-trust issue, shareholder disapproval — causes management to abandon the planned action or event making any potential profit impossible. Misjudging the risk can be expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to perform independently to the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workouts are used to insulate a portion of the portfolio from the short term (mis)behavior of markets. Typically, performing better in bear markets but lagging in bull markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second-largest portion of the portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically in 10-15 workouts at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett used borrowed money in workouts — a borrowing limit of 25% of the portfolio’s net worth — because of the higher degree of safety due to predictability of results and lower chance of short-term declines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control Situations:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The activist role: Buy a controlling interest in a company or a large enough position to influence corporate policy (he would rather others did the work).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires a wide margin of safety and a large profit potential to be worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each situation is expected to take several years — to gain enough shares to assume control and to realize a profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generals may become control situations if the price remains low for a long enough time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can insulate the portfolio from short-term market moves, like workouts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to move independently to the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once controlled, market price was irrelevant. Operating performance of the business was all that mattered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentioned Holdings:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commonwealth Trust Co. (1958 Letter)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 to 20% position in the three partnerships at the time — at roughly 12% of outstanding shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average purchase price was $51. The intrinsic value was $125. $10/share in earnings. $50 million in assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large bank owned 25.5% of outstanding shares, with the potential to merge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illiquid, inactive stock — only 300 shareholders with 2-3 trades per month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett eventually sold it for a profit — $80/share — because he found a (better) investment in a control situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sanborn Map (1960 Letter)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;35% position in the portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett’s first attempt as an activist investor in a control situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published and revised detailed city maps — showing water mains, fire hydrants, roof types, etc. — in the U.S. mostly for fire insurance companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The map was a monopoly, that eventually declined due to a new, competitive method of underwriting that didn’t require maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it also held a substantial investment portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1958, shares sold at $45/share, valuing the investment portfolio at 70 cents on the dollar and getting the map business free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal was to separate the two, the portfolio from the map business, to realize the fair value of the portfolio and make the map business profitable again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The board objected, instead offering to exchange Sanborn stock for the securities in the investment portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company (1961 Letter)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started as a general but took control (70%) in 1961 — started buying shares five years prior, with an average price of $28/share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly inactive market for the shares, only 15 shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufuctured farm equipment and water systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had static revenue and no profits over the prior decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially used a 40% discount on inventory and a 15% discount on receivables in estimating value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal was to sell off assets and turnaround the company by restoring earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installed new management — Harry Bottle — after old management refused to make changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottle exceeded expectations. He sold assets for cash and turned Dempster profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excess cash — from asset sales and profits — was invested in undervalued securities via a portfolio within Dempster. The portfolio was initially valued at $35/share — higher than the average purchase price of Dempster stock — plus the newly profitable business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The business (minus the portfolio) was sold in 1963 at $80/share. The partnership retained control of the portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berkshire Hathaway
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Announced a controlling interest in the November 1965 letter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially bought as a General.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought below net current asset value – initially valued it at 100% current assets and 50% fixed asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought National Indemnity and National Fire and Marine through Berkshire in 1967.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. through Berkshire in 1969.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett had low expectations of the textile business in 1969. He was more enthusiastic about the insurance and bank businesses. He didn’t want to liquidate the textile business and put 1,100 people out of work (so long as the textile business earned a decent profit and did not need large additional amounts of capital).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data and qualitative information from 10K and 10Q reports can be used to evaluate the following principles:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vigilant leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term prospects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stock stability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy at attractive prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, management focus more on optimizing their own pay rather than optimizing returns to the shareholders. In other cases, management may have the intention of maximizing the returns to the shareholders, but are taking high risks in doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many managers simply want to grow their “empire” with the shareholders’ retained earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio = liabilities/equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company’s goal should be the flexibility to enter good projects at all times and withstand any challenges in the market. This is generally achieved when the company sustains a low debt-to-equity ratio of below 0.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some industries are characterized by low debt-to-equity ratios; while banks, with a core product of debt, typically have higher ratios. You should therefore also consider industry standard for normal levels of debt.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current ratio = current assets/current liabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a company always receives more cash than it pays out, the company can meet its short-term debt obligations at any time (typically current ratio between 1.5 and 2.5)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a low current ratio may mean that the company has problems meeting their short-term obligations, while higher current ratio may indicate bad money management due to an inability to collect payment from vendors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return on equity = net income / shareholders’ equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in general, you should look for companies that have had a consistent ROE of above 8% over the last 10 years. It tells you that the company is consistently making a decent profit with the earnings that management retains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for a ROE that has been steady or even increasing over the last eight to ten years. This means that the company generally keep all or some of the capital for future investment and increases the equity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check the industry trend for comparison&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never be attracted to a high return while compromising security. In other words, manage risk first (i.e., D/E), then consider the remaining choices based on yield (i.e, ROE).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By choosing a company with historical D/E of below 0.5, you will most likely end up with companies with lower ROE, but they will likely be more sustainable in the future.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compensation packages based on stock price performance gives management wrong incentives to act truthfully to protect the shareholders’ interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trustworthy companies and management teams disclose the structure of the compensation plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managers should only be rewarded based on performance and long-term goals. You should look for long-term roadmaps with a variety of objectives to be obtained.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find business that has sustainable competitive advantage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher profitability, higher return on capital, and large market share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sustainable competitive advantage cannot be duplicated by competitors; hence the business will keep pouring money into the owners’ pockets.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, Coca-Cola has a great moat due to its enormous brand value, share of mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wal-Mart has a wide moat due to its cost structure where it can buy products with large volume from its suppliers at a cheaper price than its competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple has networks effect: the more people join apple community the more profit it made
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company enjoys a network effect advantage when the values of it’s product or service increases with the number of users. Network effect companies are often digital. Facebook, Google, eBay and Western Union are prime examples of such companies. Take Facebook as an example. The more users it has, the greater the reach it has with its ads, the more companies are willing to pay for its reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geico has low cost when price significant to customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample moats from different industries. High cost of switching to Samsung even iphone is more expensive
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intangible assets such as brands and patents
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples of intangible asset advantages include: patents, brand reputation and government licences such as Disney. Tiffany &amp;#x26; Co. is a prime example of a company with an excellent brand reputation. The company’s established brand name provides it with significant pricing power: a necklace from Tiffany &amp;#x26; Co. could easily costs several thousand more than a necklace from a less well-known brand. Vanguard’s patented technique that avoids taxes on mutual funds has enabled it to charge significantly less management fees for its financial products while preventing incumbents from imitating it. Bond rating agencies are great examples of companies that have a significant regulatory advantage. Ratings agencies must be granted a “Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organization” recognition before they can practice in the United States. This stringent regulatory requirement limits the playing field and allows ratings agencies to enjoy absurd profit margins (Moody’s was 50% according to the book).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low cost
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wal-Mart can buy at quantities and prices that competitors can’t match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost advantages can stem from four sources: cheaper processes, better locations, unique assets and greater scale. Process based advantages are often less desirable because other companies might attempt to copy their process. These types of advantages are the most salient in industries where price plays a critical part in the customer’s purchasing decision. According to the author, Southwest Airlines had a process-based cost advantage moat in the airline industry. The company used only one type of jet, minimized ground time and rewarded employee thrift, which allowed them to charge less than their competitors. Southwest was an exception to the generalization that process-based moats are less desirable. Their thrift-centric process was so different from their competitor’s processes that it could not be du&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high switching costs (“stickiness”)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most people will not bother with the hassle of changing operating system such as Microsoft, because they do not want to re-learn the new system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dorsey identifies three main flavours of switching costs — tight integration with a customer’s business, high monetary switching costs and high retraining costs. Oracle and Adobe are two companies in this category of companies. Oracle’s database systems are so heavily ingrained into their client’s businesses that it would be extremely costly for firms to replace them. Furthermore, replacing them could entail unwanted operational risks. Such tight integration with a customer’s business enables high retention rates, steady cash flows from customer annuities and a certain degree of pricing power for Oracle. Most digital designers have spent years mastering Adobe Photoshop. If a design firm were to force its designers to use a different image editing software it would incur a significant financial and timely retraining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;porter 5 forces
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;barriers to entry&lt;/strong&gt;: advantages that existing, established companies have over new entrants. A firm will enter the industry it it forecasts that the potential reward for being in it is greater than the cost of overcoming the barriers and the retaliation that is likely to happen.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supply-side economies of scale: spread the fixed costs over a larger volume of units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demand-side benefits of scale: network effect, people tend to value being in a ‘network’ with a larger number of people who use the same company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customer switching costs: airline frequent flyer programs are an example. Customer doesn’t want to switch to different product to avoid re-learning (such as microsoft operating system, or iphone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capital requirements: websites and apps can be launched cheaply and easily as opposed to the brick and mortar industries of the past. Railroads are almost impossible to enter. It takes a ton of capital and it is an enormous risk to build a second railroad network next to to the existing one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incumbency advantages independent of size (e.g. customer loyalty and brand equity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unequal access to distribution channels: new entrants may struggle to find a retail or wholesale channel to sell through as existing competitors will have a claim on them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;governmental policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;threat of substitutes&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perceived level of product differentiation: lowest price or differentiation. Developing multiple products for niche markets is one way to mitigate this factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number of substitute products available in the market, ease of substitution, availability of close substitutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;substitutes that are becoming cheaper relative to performance and substitutes that earn high returns on capital are likely to have more new entries in the future, which will drive prices down within that industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies within industry of power grids face pretty much no substitute at all. No matter how the electricity is produced, it must be transported somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;newspaper face tough competition from online and social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bargaining power of customers&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ability of customers to put the firm under pressure, which also affects the customer’s sensitivity to price changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RFM (customer value) analysis: how recently did the customer purchase? how often do they purchase, how much do they spend?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bargaining power of suppliers&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;degree of differentiation of inputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impact of inputs on cost and differentiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presence of substitute inputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strength of distribution channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supermarkets are powerful players in distributing products of suppliers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;competitive rivalry&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sustainable competitive advantage through innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;competition between online and offline organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;level of advertising expense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower prices, new products and increased service and common weapons of choice and they l0ead to lower profitability for companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for industry with few companies, high growth and low fixed costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;n : number of years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffet’s opinion is that no investment should yield a lower return than a federally issued bond because the federal reserve can simply print more money in order to fulfill its interest obligations; therefore, if a ten-year bond has a 3% return, the investor should never discount a ten-year investment decision lower than 3% annually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can use a conservative market price to determine the current discount rate or potential rate of return
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i = (FV / PV)&lt;sup&gt;1/n&lt;/sup&gt; - 1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffet says, “Intrinsic value can be defined simply: it is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every valuation technique can be boiled down to one thing: “How much money can I expect to get in return for my initial investment”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a great starting point for picking a percent would be an assessment of the company’s historical free cash flow growth rate. That can be found during your assessment of the company’s previous cash flow statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DF&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;: the discount factor during year n&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DR: discount rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the discount rate represents the return you would like to receive for owning the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DFCF&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; : discounted free cash flow for year n&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DPCF : discounted perpetuity cash flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LGR : long term growth rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for anyone who thinks they’ll be able to predict a company’s ability to grow their profits, beyond the 10 year mark, best of luck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is this company going to have the capacity to remain relevant beyond 10 years?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if yes, simply using the rate of inflation (2-3%) to protect your estimate from being too optimistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;DCF model allowed you to estimate the company’s value by discounting cash flows into perpetuity. The Buffet instrinsic value provide a finite solution and only summed the cash flows for a 10-year period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DCF model use free cash flow, and Buffetts calculator use dividends plus book value growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the model that provides the most conservative estimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limitations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it only works if a stock fulfills all four of Warren Buffett’s principles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a company lacks certain aspects of the principles discussed, those aspects should be assessed as additional risk to the investor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these qualitative aspects should be accounted for by lowering the book value growth rate, lowering the dividend rate, requiring a higher discount rate, ore not even evaluating the stock all together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high-growth companies
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high growth companies naturally have a better opportunity to grow their book value compared to large, slow-growth companies, even if it’s for a limited period of time. These growth rates will yield very high intrinsic values in the calculator. Avoid using more than 13-15% for book value growth in the calculator, even if the company has shown much higher growth over the past 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high degree of share buy-back
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy-backs distort the book value, which in turn also distorts the intrinsic value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it’s corporate strategy to reduce the number of shares outstanding, you’ll probably want to use the DCF model instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stock splits
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;historical book value growth rate isn’t representative of its actual performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe easier to use the DCF model to avoid the disparity when assessing how much the book value may grow in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buffettsbooks.com/how-to-invest-in-stocks/advanced-course/lesson-28/&quot;&gt;when to sell stocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probably wants to consider the impacts of capital gains and bank fees before you impulsively switch assets. You should revert back to Warren Buffett’s four principles:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is the company still managed by vigilant leaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does the company still have products and services that have long-term prospects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are the company’s earnings and debt management still stable and predictable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;based on the projected cash flows, what kind of return you expect at the current trading price?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe you feel that 20% or 35% of your portfolio in one stock is too risky. Although Buffett likes a focused portfolio, he still keesp more than 10 different picks in his portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to decide if you should keep or sell your current holding (stock A), or invest in another (stock B), follow these 4 easy steps:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calculate the expected annual return for stocks A and B based on the current market prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subtract the cost of capital gains tax from stock A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calculate whether stock A or B yields the highest expected annual return based on a given time frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company has changed for the worse. Perhaps the company’s management has shifted their focus to an area where you believe to drive less growth than you would like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s other investment with better opportunity cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I find it much easier to think about what should develop over a relatively long period of time than what is likely in any short period. As Ben Graham said: “In the long run, the market is a weighing machine – in the short run, a voting machine.” I have always found it easier to evaluate weights dictated by fundamentals than votes dictated by psychology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My mentor, Ben Graham, used to say: ‘Speculation is neither illegal, immoral nor fattening (financially).‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would consider a year in which we declined 15% and the Average 30% to be much superior to a year when both we and the Average advanced 20%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I make no attempt to forecast the general market — my efforts are devoted to finding undervalued securities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just because something is cheap does not mean it is not going to go down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You will not be right simply because a large number of people momentarily agree with you. You will not be right simply because important people agree with you… You will be right, over the course of many transactions, if your hypotheses are correct, your facts are correct, and your reasoning is correct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Short periods of measurement exaggerate chance fluctuations in performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I can and do promise is that: Our investments will be chosen on the basis of value, not popularity; that we will attempt to bring risk of permanent capital loss (not short-term quotational loss) to an absolute minimum by obtaining a wide margin of safety in each commitment and a diversity of commitments…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is always startling to see how relatively small differences in rates add up to very significant sums over a period of years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Never count on making a good sale. Have the purchase price be so attractive that even a mediocre sale gives good results. The better sales will be the frosting on the cake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If a 20% or 30% drop in the market value of your equity holdings is going to produce emotional or financial distress, you should simply avoid common stock type investments.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…my own investment philosophy has developed around the theory that prophecy reveals far more of the frailties of the prophet than it reveals of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The course of the stock market will determine, to a great degree, when we will be right, but the accuracy of our analysis of the company will largely determine whether we will be right. In other words, we tend to concentrate on what should happen, not when it should happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The availability of a quotation for your business interest (stock) should always be an asset to be utilized if desired. If it gets silly enough in either direction, you take advantage of it. Its availability should never be turned into a liability whereby its periodic aberrations in turn formulate your judgments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the really big money tends to be made by investors who are right on qualitative decisions but, at least in my opinion, the more sure money tends to be made on the obvious quantitative decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in 1937, Ben Graham covers the basics of accounting and financial statements. It’s a condensed guide on reading the balance sheet and income statement, explaining standard metrics, and providing tips on determining a company’s soundness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial statements show a company’s financial soundness and operating results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance sheet shows how much a company owns (assets) and owes (liabilities) at a particular time. Assets and liabilities must balance out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assets = property like plants and equipment, accounts receivable, cash, intangible assets like goodwill, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liabilities = accounts payable, current debt, long-term debt plus stockholder equity, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intangible assets can be over-inflated or deflated depending on the company. The same is true for goodwill and assets written down through depreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company’s size can be measured by its assets or sales relative to the other companies in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On small-cap investing: “Where the purchase is made for speculative profits or long-term capital gains, it is not essential to insist upon the dominant size, for there are countless examples of smaller companies prospering more than larger ones. After all, the large companies themselves presented the best speculative opportunities while there were still comparatively small.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “watered stock” was given to companies that inflated their asset value, thus inflating book value, which was later written off with special charges against earnings. Graham offers U.S. Steel’s inflated $600 million worth of assets. In other words, asset values on a balance sheet may or may not represent an accurate value of an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depreciation, amortization, and depletion apply a normal wearing out or aging of building and equipment over its typical lifespan. It allows the asset’s cost to be charged off (the income statement) over several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depletion is used in commodity businesses like mining or oil to account for resources taken out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current assets listed as “marketable securities” might be a place to unearth hidden value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intangible assets can’t be accurately weighed or measured. Includes patents, trademarks, goodwill, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be hidden value found in goodwill. If goodwill is written off after a company has improved financially, it’s likely that goodwill is worth more than what is stated on the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real value of intangible assets is more likely found in the income statement than the balance sheet. “The earning power of these intangibles rather than their balance sheet valuation counts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current assets are cash or assets that are easily converted into cash like receivables and inventory — and are shown in order of liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current liabilities are debts incurred during normal business operations to be paid or maturing within one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Ratio = current assets/current liabilities. A high current ratio shows that the company will have no problem meeting short-term obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More liquid current assets allow for a lower margin above current liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working Capital (or Net Current Assets) = current assets – current liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excess of Working Capital makes it easier for a company to run daily operations, grow the business, and meet emergency needs without taking on new financing. A lack of working capital means its harder to cover current liabilities and likely means forgoing business growth, with a worst-case scenario of bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham’s Net-Net Working Capital Strategy: “The working capital available for each share of common stock is an interesting figure in common stock analysis. Over the years, the growth or decline of the working capital position is also worthy of the investor’s attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory)/Current Liabilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inventory should be looked at concerning other factors to assess how efficiently the company turns assets into profit — like turnover (turnover ratio = annual sales/inventory). Inventory turnover can be compared on a year-to-year basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receivables can be looked at against sales and compared year to year. A large ratio of receivables to sales means the company may be at a higher risk of loss due to unpaid accounts. Also, watch for companies that allow long-term payment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks selling below their cash value per share may be worth more than their value by the market. Stockholders may benefit from an appreciation in price or distribution of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important individual item among the current liabilities is that of Notes Payable.” If notes payable — accounts payable — are larger than cash and receivables, the company may be too reliant on credit. Over several years, if accounts payable grows faster than sales and profits, it’s a sign of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserve is an all-encompassing term for money to be used for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham breaks reserves into three classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definite liabilities — for taxes, accident claims, legal settlements, customer refunds, etc., that are closer to current liabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offset against an asset — losses on receivables, decline in inventory may be an actual decline or set up to offset a future decline (if it’s a future decline, it may be a surplus).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a surplus — contingency reserves or money set aside for a future purpose that is more likely not used as intended but only if it gets transferred back to surplus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book value attempts to show the liquidation value of all the tangible assets, but the true liquidation value is more likely to be less than book value. The reason: inventory and fixed assets are likely to be sold at a significant loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book Value = total assets – intangible assets – liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book value may be overstated or understated depending on reserves that should be considered a surplus. Reserves considered a surplus should be added to book value to get a closer approximation of the true book value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Current Asset Value (NCAV) = Current assets – liabilities and preferred stock. NCAV might be a good representation of liquidation value if current assets are a large portion of total assets. Stocks selling below NCAV may be extremely undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earning Power = a company’s expected earnings over future years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintenance and depreciation may under or overstate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average earnings over several years should easily cover interest and dividend payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware of companies showing a trend in improved earnings. “However, before purchasing a common stock because of its favourable trend, it is well to ask two questions: (a) How certain am I that this favourable trend will continue, and (b) How large a price am I paying in advance for the expected continuance of the trend?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future earnings estimates explain why two stocks with similar earnings per share can trade at vastly different P/E ratios. A low P/E stock has a low expected earnings growth priced in, while a high P/E stock reflects a high expected earnings growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 ways that corporations can use financial reporting to enhance their value are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce their cost of capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve their credit ratings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase their price-earnings multiple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“every debit must have a credit,” double entry system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a well-managed and profitable business will show a strong cash flow through the plumbing of accounts from net income to growing/decreasing equity and/or dividend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cash-based accounting:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transactions are recorded based on the inflow and outflow of cash when the money changes accounts, not when the service or product is provided or received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;useful for small businesses that operate on a cash basis, such as “mom and pop” style businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s not a good fit for large businesses because it is slow and delayed in tracking revenues and expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accrual accounting:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expenditures must be recorded when incurred and not when paid. Similarly, revenue must be recorded when there is an outflow of services or goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it provides a more precise and realistic picture of the company’s performance. However, cash flow statement analysis would be required to account for any inconsistencies caused by accrual accounting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies with net incomes consistently at or more than 20% of revenues often are industry leaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies with strong liquidity and little external debt are likely to “sail on through the troubled times.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett sees stocks as “equity bonds” with ever-rising “yields,” or earnings per share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider selling any stock priced more than 40 times its earnings per share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid investing in companies with high expenses for research, depreciation and interest.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 1950s, an economist and professional investor named Benjamin Graham served as a mentor to Warren Buffett, who became one of the world’s wealthiest people. Graham pioneered the practice of value investing – buying into companies with low stock prices. Buffett, Graham’s student at New York’s Columbia University, later worked as an analyst at Graham’s Wall Street investment firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When he started his own investment business, Buffett altered the Graham value investing method in several ways. Buffett ignores the Graham rule of selling stocks after they appreciate by 50% because sometimes their prices will rise much more. Graham would buy a stock based primarily on its cost – the lower, the better. Buffett favours high-quality companies with predictable cash flows, so he is inclined to pay a “fair price” for their shares, not necessarily the lowest amount possible. Graham espoused the importance of holding a diversified portfolio of stocks, increasing the odds that moneymaking stocks would offset losers. Buffett prefers a portfolio concentrated on a few stocks that he considers excellent investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett studies the financial statements of companies to distinguish the best from the rest. He believes that top firms share certain financial characteristics. He invests only in financially self-sustaining companies with such a strong “durable competitive advantage” over their rivals that it creates “monopoly-like economics, allowing them either to charge more or to sell more.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-business-models-that-buffett-likes-best&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#three-business-models-that-buffett-likes-best&quot; aria-label=&quot;three business models that buffett likes best permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Three Business Models That Buffett Likes Best&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The companies that attract Buffett’s investment operate one of three business models: “They sell either a unique product or a unique service, or they are the low-cost buyer and seller of a product or service the public consistently needs.” Firms that sell unique products include, for instance, beer brewer Budweiser, soft drink producer Coca-Cola and candy maker Hershey. Many other companies sell beer, soda and chocolate, but they lack the singular brand power of Bud, Coke and Hershey’s. Examples of companies that sell uniquely branded services include credit rating agency Moody’s Corp., tax service provider H&amp;#x26;R Block, Inc. and bank Wells Fargo &amp;#x26; Co. Retail chains Walmart and Costco, and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, fit into the third type of business model: the lowest-cost provider of such staples as food and clothing or such fundamental services as transportation. Buffett favours these well-known companies with powerful brands that command “a piece of the consumer’s mind.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffett reads three types of financial statements to learn about a business: its income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. He analyzes these statements individually and collectively to discern the truth about a company’s prospects and the value of its stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The income statement, issued quarterly and annually, summarizes revenue, operating costs, overhead expenses and net results, which are either profits or losses. The cash flow statement accounts for cash provided or consumed by operations, investments and financing activities over some time. In contrast, the balance sheet captures the condition of a firm at one point; it summarizes the state of assets and liabilities on a particular date. Buffett compares different line items on financial statements to assess the strengths and weaknesses of companies. For example, he subtracts the cost of goods sold (materials and labour) from revenue to determine gross profit and then divides gross profit by revenue to calculate the company’s gross profit margin. A firm that reliably achieves margins of 40% or more probably has a durable competitive advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies operating activities generate selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses, such as executive compensation, advertising fees and legal costs. Like many line items in financial statements, SGA expenses convey limited information about an organization and its likely fate. Comparisons of line items are more instructive. For example, Buffett checks the percentage of gross profit these expenses devour. Companies with stable SGA expenses as a gross profit percentage tend to have dominant positions in their industries. In general, “anything under 30% is considered fantastic.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett avoids investing in businesses burdened by huge commitments to research and development, preferring companies like Coca-Cola, an industry leader selling the same secret-formula beverage for more than 100 years. In some industries, such as information technology, research and development is a critical sources of competitive clout. But technological change is so fast that any competitive advantage from a research breakthrough could prove fleeting. Consider the relative R&amp;#x26;D burdens of chewing gum maker Wrigley and automaker General Motors: GM constantly must invest in R&amp;#x26;D to design new vehicles or risk losing market share. Wrigley has been selling the same famous chewing gum brand for decades. Which company has been a better investment? By 2008, an investor who bought $100,000 of stock in each company in 1990 would have GM shares worth $97,000 and Wrigley shares worth $547,000. Buffett is not fond of heavy depreciation and interest expenses, either. Depreciation reflects the non-cash cost of wear and tear on operating assets, such as buildings and equipment. Buffett likes to invest in companies with low depreciation expenses as a percentage of gross profits. Similarly, he routinely seeks businesses with annual interest payments that consume the smallest possible fraction of gross profit – the less interest expense, the less debt the firm carries.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitable companies divide their net income by the number of outstanding common shares to determine earnings per share, a financial metric that securities analysts widely use. However, Buffett pays more attention to the net income in his appraisal of companies. He divides net income by revenue to calculate a firm’s return on revenue and, in turn, assess its competitive position. If its return on revenue is consistently greater than 20%, the company probably has a pivotal, ongoing advantage over the rest of its industry. If its return on revenue is steadily below 10%, the firm likely operates in an intensely competitive field. Many companies have returned from 10% to 20%, and some of them represent “long-term investment gold that no one has yet discovered.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance sheet shows a firm’s assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity at a certain date. Total assets minus total liabilities equals equity. These three balance sheet components convey essential information about a firm’s future. Current assets include cash and liquid investments as well as inventory and accounts receivable that the firm can convert to cash within a year. These “working assets” and their amounts vary depending on the company’s day-to-day operations. For instance, cash relative to accounts receivable may fluctuate as business conditions change. Non-current assets include property, plant and equipment, and such intangibles as franchises, copyrights and patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett likes to see a strong cash and liquid investments position paired with little external debt. Businesses with this profile are rather likely to “sail on through the troubled times.” Buffett also calculates the net amount of accounts receivable, or receivables minus bad debts, as a percentage of sales revenue; companies with a low percentage often are leaders in their industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-liability-side-of-the-balance-sheet&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-liability-side-of-the-balance-sheet&quot; aria-label=&quot;the liability side of the balance sheet permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Liability Side of the Balance Sheet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current liabilities are debts due within one year. These include accrued expenses, accounts payable and short-term loans. Other classes of liabilities include long-term debt maturing in more than one year. Generally, companies with an enduring edge over their rivals are generating enough cash internally to preclude the need to accumulate large amounts of long-term debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, or the “current ratio,” is a common measure of corporate liquidity. In conventional analysis, a current ratio of more than one indicates better liquidity than a ratio of less than one. But, according to Buffett, certain companies with a commanding advantage have current ratios below one because their reliably solid businesses negate the need for a big “liquidity cushion” against insolvency. Buffett applies the same argument to the ratio of long-term debt to shareholders’ equity: Some companies that lead their industries to have higher debt-to-equity ratios because they use a big portion of their net income to repurchase stock or pay dividends. These two uses of earnings affect the growth of shareholders’ equity, but neither indicates that a company is facing fierce competitive pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retained earnings represent net income that a company reinvests in its operations instead of spending it on stock repurchases or dividend payments. Retained earnings are a component of shareholders’ equity on the balance sheet; amassing retained earnings increases shareholders’ equity, or the firm’s net worth. Buffett believes companies with rapidly growing retained earnings will likely have a long-term advantage over their competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett runs a publicly traded investment holding company called Berkshire Hathaway that does not pay dividends to its shareholders. This policy has helped Berkshire accumulate a mountain of retained earnings, contributing to a significant, long-term increase in the firm’s value: Its pretax earnings per share rose from $4 in 1965 to $13,023 in 2007. Buffett prefers stock repurchases to dividend payments as a means of rewarding shareholders. By buying back its shares, a company can increase its earnings per share without actually earning more net income; as earnings per share increase, the price of the shares is likely to increase, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax liability is a major consideration. Buffett would have to pay income tax if he received dividends on his Berkshire stock. Instead, he will accumulate capital gains on his Berkshire stock tax-free as long as he holds the stock. He has already stockpiled $64 billion of unrealized capital gains on his Berkshire shares and has not yet paid any tax on these paper profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Berkshire Hathaway makes long-term investments in companies with substantial, sustainable competitive advantages, it owns stocks that behave like bonds with yields that rise over time. Buffett calls these stocks “equity bonds.” Instead of a regular bond’s cash interest payments, the yield on an equity bond is the company’s earnings per share. And as earnings per share growth over time, so does yield on an equity bond. For instance, during the late 1980s, Buffett bought stock in Coca-Cola at prices averaging $6.50 per share at a time when the company had annual earnings of 46 cents per share, “which in Warren’s world equates to an initial rate of return of 7%. By 2007, Coca-Cola was earning $2.57 a share,” translating to a 39.9% return on his original investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett is a long-term investor in the stocks of companies with durable competitive advantages because “the longer you hold on to them, the better you do.” Nevertheless, three types of circumstances make selling a great stock advisable: if proceeds from the sale could fund a better investment, if the company is ceding its competitive advantage or if the price of the firm’s shares soars in an overheated bull market. If a company’s stock price is 40 times more than its annual earnings per share, “it just might be time to sell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, rather than buy another stock trading at 40 times earnings, Buffett prefers to hold on to his cash until the market settles down and great equity bonds once again become available at affordable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the Buffett investing style requires patience, but the potential payoff is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gross profit margin&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firms with excellent long-term economics tend to have consistently higher margins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durable competitive advantage creates  a high margin because of the freedom to price over the cost
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater than 40% = Durable competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than 40% = competition eroding margins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than 20% = no sustainable competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency is key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales Goods and Administration&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with no durable competitive advantage show wild variation in SG&amp;#x26;A as % of gross profit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than 30% is fantastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearing 100% is in the highly competitive industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency is key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;#x26;D&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a competitive advantage is created by a patent or tech advantage, it will disappear at some point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High R&amp;#x26;D usually dictates high SG&amp;#x26;A which threatens the competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depreciation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with durable competitive advantages tend to have lower depreciation costs as a % of gross profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interest expenses&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with high-interest expenses relative to operating income tend to be either:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a fiercely competitive industry where large capital expenditure is required to stay competitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a company with excellent business economics that acquired debt in the leveraged buyout
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with durable competitive advantages often carry little or no interest expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren’s favourites in the consumer products category all have less than 15% operating income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest expenses vary widely between industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest ratios can be very informative of the level of economic danger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In any industry, the company with the lowest interest ratio to Operating Income usually has a competitive advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;net earnings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for consistency and upward long-term trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of share repurchase, it is possible for the net earnings trend to differ from the EPS trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred over EPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durable competitive advantage companies report higher % net earnings to total revenues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If net earnings are less than 10%, likely to be in a highly competitive business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a company shows net earnings history greater than 20% of total revenues, it is probably benefiting from a long-term competitive advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-year period showing consistency and an upward trend.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it may be an indicator that products don’t need to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cash and equivalents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A high number means either:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company has a competitive advantage generating lots of cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just sold a business or bonds (not necessarily good)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A low stockpile of cash usually means poor to mediocre economics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are three ways to create a large cash reserve.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell new bonds or equity to public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell business or asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has an ongoing business generating more cash than it burns (usually means durable competitive advantage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a company is suffering a short-term problem, Buffett looks at &lt;strong&gt;cash + marketable securities + little debt to see whether it has the financial strength to ride it out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test to see what is creating cash by looking at the past 7 yrs of balance sheets. This will reveal how the cash was created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inventory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufacturers with durable competitive advantages have the advantage that the products they sell do not change and, therefore, will never become obsolete. Buffett likes this advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When identifying manufacturers with a durable competitive advantage, look for inventory and net earnings that rise correspondingly. This indicates that the company is finding profitable ways to increase sales which calls for an increase in inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufacturers with inventories that spike up and down indicate competitive industries subject to boom and bust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Receivables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net receivables tell us a great deal about competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain an advantage by offering better credit terms, causing an increase in sales and receivables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the company consistently shows a lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some competitive advantage which requires further digging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Property, Plant &amp;#x26; Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company with a durable competitive advantage doesn’t need to upgrade its equipment to stay competitive constantly. The company replaces it when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows. In contrast, the no-advantage company requires debt to finance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Producing a consistent product that doesn’t change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca-Cola, Johnson &amp;#x26; Johnson etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;goodwill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you see an increase in goodwill over many years, you can assume it’s because the company is out buying other businesses above book value. GOOD if buying businesses with a durable competitive advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If goodwill stays the same, the company, when acquiring other companies, is either paying less than book value or not acquiring. Businesses with moats never sell for less than book value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intangible Assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intangibles acquired are on the balance sheet at fair value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internally developed brand names (Coke, Wrigleys, Band-Aid) are not reflected on the balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the reasons competitive advantage power can remain hidden for so long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Assets &amp;#x26; Return on Total Assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure efficiency using ROA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital is a barrier to entry. One thing that makes a competitive advantage durable is the cost of assets needed to get in. This is why we calculate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/how-to-asset-reproduction-value-analysis/&quot;&gt;Asset Reproduction Value&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/book-reviews/greenwald-earnings-power-value-investing-epv/&quot;&gt;EPV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many analysts argue the higher return, the better. Buffett states that high ROA may indicate vulnerability in the durability of the competitive advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example- E.g. Raising $43b to take on KO is impossible, but $1.7b to take on Moody’s is. Although Moody’s ROA and underlying economics are far superior to Coca Cola, the durability is far weaker because of lower entry cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, other current liabilities and short-term debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay away from companies that ‘roll over the debt,’ e.g. Bear Stearns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When investing in financial institutions, Buffett shies from bigger borrowers of short-term than long-term debt.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His favourite ‘Wells Fargo’ has 57 cents of short-term debt for every dollar of long term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggressive banks (like Bank of America) have $2.09 short-term for every dollar long term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durability equates to the stability of being conservative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Debt coming Due&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies lump their yearly long-term debt due with short-term debt on the balance sheet. This makes it seem like there is more short-term debt than the real amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important: Companies with durable comparable advantages need little or no LT debt to maintain operations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much debt coming due in a single year spooks investors and can offer attractive entry points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a mediocre company with problems with too much debt due leads to cash flow problems and certain bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;long-term debt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett says that durable competitive advantages carry little to no LT debt because the company is so profitable that even expansions or acquisitions are self-financed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are interested in long-term debt load for the last ten years. If the ten yrs of operation show little to no long-term debt, the company has some strong competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett’s historic purchases indicate that on any given year, the company should have sufficient yearly net earnings to pay all long-term within a three or 4-year earnings period. (e.g. Coke + Moody’s = 1yr)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies with enough earning power to pay the long-term debt in less than 3 or 4 years are good candidates in our search for long-term competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, these companies are targets for leveraged buyouts, which saddles the business with long-term debt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all else indicates the company has a moat, but it has a ton of debt, a leveraged buyout may have created the debt. In these cases, the company’s bonds offer the better bet in that the company’s earnings power is focused on paying off the debt and not growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important: little or no long-term debt often means a Good Long Term Bet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Liabilities &amp;#x26; Debt to Shareholders Equity Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt to shareholders equity ratio helps identify whether the company uses debt or equity (includes retained earnings) to finance operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company with a moat uses earning power and should show higher equity and lower liabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt to Shareholders Equity Ratio: Total Liabilities / Shareholders Equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem with using it as the identifier is that the economics of companies with durable competitive advantages are so great they don’t need a large amount of equity or retained earnings on the balance sheet to get the job done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if the Treasury Share Adjusted Debt to Shareholder Equity Ratio is less than 0.8, the company has a durable competitive advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retained Earning&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important indicators of durable competitive advantage. Net earnings can be paid out as dividends, used to buy back shares or retained for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the company loses more than it has accumulated, retained earnings are negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a company isn’t adding to its retained earnings, it isn’t growing its net worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth rate of retained earnings is a good indicator of whether it benefits from a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is negative because it chose to buyback stock and pay dividends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more earnings retained, the faster it grows and increases the growth rate for future earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;treasury stock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carried on the balance sheet as a negative value because it represents a shareholder equity reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with moats have free cash, so treasury shares are the hallmark of durable competitive advantages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When shares are bought back and held as treasury stock, it effectively decreases company equity. This increases the return on shareholders’ equity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High return is a sign of competitive advantage. It’s good to know if it’s generated by financial engineering, exceptional business economics, or a combination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To see which is which, convert the negative value of treasury shares into a positive one and add it to shareholders’ equity. Then divide net earnings by new shareholders’ equity. This will give the return on equity minus the effects of window dressing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the presence of treasury shares and a history of buybacks are good indicators that the company has the competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;preferred + common stock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in search for D.C.A., we look for the absence of preferred stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return on Shareholder equity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;d.c.a. show higher than average returns on shareholders’ equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the company shows a history of strong net earnings but shows lower equity, probably d.c.a. because strong companies don’t need to retain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Expenditures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never invest in telephone companies because of big capital outlays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important: company with durable competitive advantage uses a smaller portion of earnings for capital expenditure for continuing operations than those without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare CAPEX to net earnings, add up total CAPEX for the ten-yr period and compare it with total net earnings over the same period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important: &lt;strong&gt;if historically using less than 50%, then a good place to look for durable competitive advantage. If less than 25%, probably has a competitive advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stock buybacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an indicator of d.c.a. is a history of repurchasing/retiring its shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at cash from investment activities. “Issuance (Retirement) of Stock, Net”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Occasionally even a company with a durable competitive advantage can screw up and do something stupid…Think New Coke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rule here is simple: Little or No Long-Term Debt Often Means a Good Long-Term Bet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since the future is largely unpredictable, we are usually compelled to take either the current and past earnings as a guide, and to use these figures as a base in making a reasonable estimate of future earnings. If there have been reasonably normal business conditions for a period of years, the average of the earnings over the period may afford a better index of earning power than the current figure alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Outside of the field of banks, insurance companies, and, particularly, investment trusts, it is only in the exceptional case that book value or liquidation value plays an important role in security analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The book value of a common stock is usually not important, but it may be of interest where the book value is either much larger or much smaller than the market price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The book value really measures, therefore, not what the stockholder could get out of their business (its liquidation value), but rather what they have put into the business, including undistributed earnings. The book value is of some importance in analysis because a very rough relationship tends to exist between the amount invested in a business and its average earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To avoid being deceived by these devices, the investor must examine both the income and the surplus account over several years, and make due allowance for any amounts changed to surplus or reserves which really represent business losses during the period. Also…the investors should be particularly careful not to exaggerate the significance of a single year’s earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The book value of a security is in most cases a rather artificial value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During periods of depression it is particularly important to watch the cash account from year to year… In such periods the way in which the losses reflect themselves in the balance sheet may be more important than the amount of the losses themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We suggest that the property account be neither accepted at face value nor entirely ignored, but that reasonable consideration be given to it in appraising the company’s securities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“..the success of an investment depends ultimately upon the future, future developments, and the future may never be forecast with accuracy. But if you have precise information as to a company’s present financial position and its past earnings record, you are better equipped to gauge its future possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you know what the figures mean, you have a sound basis for good business judgment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ben Graham’s principle of always returning to the financial statements will keep an investor from making huge mistakes, and without huge mistakes the power of compounding can take over.” — Michael Price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The investor who buys securities when the market price looks cheap on the basis of the company’s statements, and sells them when they look high on this same basis, probably will not make spectacular profits. But on the other hand, he will probably avoid equally spectacular and more frequent losses. He should have a better than average chance of obtaining satisfactory results. And this is the chief objective of intelligent investing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When neither boom nor deep depression is affecting the market, the judgment of the public on individual issues, as indicated by market prices, is usually quite good. If the market price of some issue appears out of line with the facts and figures available, it will often be found later that the price is discounting future developments not then apparent on the surface. There is, however, a frequent tendency on the part of the stock market to exaggerate the significance of changes in earnings both in a favorable and unfavorable direction.”
Investing is both Quantitative and Qualitative: “At bottom the ability to buy securities — particularly common stocks — successfully is the ability to look ahead accurately. Looking backward, however carefully, will not suffice, and may do more harm than good. Common stock selection is a difficult art — naturally, since it offers large rewards for success. It requires a skillful mental balance between facts of the past and the possibilities of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The price of common stocks will depend…not so much on past or current earnings in themselves as upon what the security buying public thinks the future earnings will be… In the ordinary case the price of a common stock is the resultant of the many estimates of what the earnings are going to be in the next six months, in the next year, or even further in the future. Some of these estimates may be entirely incorrect and some may be exceedingly accurate; but the buying and selling by the many people who make these various estimates is what mainly determines the present price of a stock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a common occurrence to find that the true value of a company’s assets is entirely different from the balance sheet total.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An investor should recognize a very strong distinction between good-will as it appears — or, more generally, fails to appear — on the balance sheet, and good-will as it is measured and reflected by the market price of the company’s securities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is the earning power of these intangibles rather than their balance sheet valuation, that really counts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Warren has learned that time will make him superrich when he invests in a company that has a durable competitive advantage working in its favor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The place that Warren goes to discover whether or not the company has a ‘durable’ competitive advantage is its financial statements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When Warren is looking at a company’s financial statement, he is looking for consistency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Warren knows that one of the great secrets to making more money is spending less money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Warren has learned over the years that companies that are busy misleading the IRS are usually hard at work misleading their shareholders as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some men read Playboy. I read annual reports.” (Warren Buffett)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When deciding whether to invest in a company, carefully analyze its soundness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that doesn’t is speculation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors often profit by buying securities that are selling below their intrinsic value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three main classes of security are “investment bonds and preferred stocks,” “speculative bonds and preferred stocks,” and “common stocks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An issuer’s financial strength and ability to pay to determine its bonds’ safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred stocks should meet all the safety tests required of bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can profit from purchasing some bonds and preferred stocks that do not qualify as investment grade if they sell below their intrinsic value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privileged issues have the safety of preferred stocks, but they also have the upside potential of common stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio diversification can offset the variability of common stock prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an investor, you should evaluate common stocks based on dividends, earnings and asset values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each of the elements in valuation — assets, earnings power, and growth — is useful in its own right. Still, the best insights into a firm’s value come from comparisons among them, especially the direct comparison between the asset value and the EPV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the EPV is substantially greater than the asset value, that difference is due to superior management or competitive advantages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t make investments into things that have an NPV of less than zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security analysis is the process of deciding which securities are sound investments. True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that does not meet these criteria is speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;common obstacles to analyst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inadequate or incorrect data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uncertainties of future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;irrational behaviour of the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“in the short term, market is a voting machine, but in the long term, it tracks value.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 functions of analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Descriptive function&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collecting important facts and presenting them in an understandable manner. This would reveal:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveal strong and weak points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make comparisons with similar issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appraise for future performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Function&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;express specific judgment by determining whether an issue should be bought, held, sold, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;common approach is to analyze the company’s ability to earn and make payments to the investor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intrinsic value is the estimated valuation based on the analyst’s opinion of the intrinsic worth of the security from different sources of information such as assets, earnings, dividends, growth, management, etc…
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the value of a business can be analyzed from the perspective of multiple earnings (P/E ratio, “earnings power”). It is cautioned that valuing a business solely from the earnings power is risky and uncharacteristic of wise analysts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Function&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should seek adequate protective provisions (margin of safety) in bonds and preferred stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;must be alert to the misrepresentation by accountants and management’s bad practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market analysis, in contrast to security analysis, attempts to forecast prices of individual securities or the action of the whole market without referring to underlying facts about individual companies. One type of market analysis, called technical analysis, refers only to past market values to predict future values. The second type of analysis refers to indices of economic activity outside the market that, presumably, have some influence over security prices. Neither of these kinds of market analysis has proven effective, and both essentially promote speculation over reasoned, fact-based investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic value is an important concept for security analysis. However, “intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms, it is understood to be that value justified by the facts…the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct…from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excess.” Although investors cannot calculate an exact intrinsic value for a given security because so many variables are involved, a careful examination can determine whether the price the market quotes is appropriate. Securities that meet stringent safety tests and appear to be selling well below their intrinsic value can often be profitable investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities traditionally fall into two categories: stocks and bonds. This classification is inadequate because it pays more attention to the form of security than to its safety and purpose. The various types of securities may be more accurately classified into three groups, each of which has its criteria for what constitutes a sound investment: fixed-value securities, including high-grade bonds and preferred stocks; variable-value senior securities, including speculative bonds and preferred stocks; and common stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;criteria-for-investing-in-fixed-value-securities&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#criteria-for-investing-in-fixed-value-securities&quot; aria-label=&quot;criteria for investing in fixed value securities permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Criteria for Investing in Fixed-Value Securities&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are not automatically safe investments because of their form. Instead, the soundness of a bond investment derives from the issuer’s ability to pay, which is, in turn, based on its financial strength. Therefore, the investor considering purchasing a bond should ask the following questions: Is the value of the company’s business more than its debts? Can the company meet its financial obligations even in the worst-case scenario, such as a recession or depression?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although no company or industry is depression-proof, two factors contribute to a company’s resilience in hard times: dominant size within its industry and sufficient earnings to cover its bond interest by a large margin. Bonds of companies that do not meet these requirements are not considered investment grade, even if the yield is highly attractive. A high yield cannot compensate for failure to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred stocks combine the limited return of bonds with the instability of common stocks. Despite these unattractive features, preferred stocks can be safe investments if they meet the same safety requirements as a bond, and their margin of safety is large enough that management is unlikely to suspend preferred dividends. The stability of the company exceeds that required for a bond investment. These stringent requirements limit the number of investment-grade preferred stocks to a very select group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income bonds, also called adjustment bonds, should be subject to the same strict investment criteria as preferred stocks. Guaranteed issues occupy a position between bond debt and preferred stocks. Prospective investors must carefully examine the terms of the guarantee and evaluate the guarantor’s financial strength. Even with fixed-value investments, investors should periodically evaluate their holdings. There is no such thing as a permanent investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many bonds and preferred stocks do not meet the requirements that would qualify them as investment grade, some issues in this category may be worth purchasing because they are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Investors must avoid issues that are selling at a discount for other reasons – for example, because the company is financially unsound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid compromising the assumed risk for an increased reward to minimize the loss of principal
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the risk is assumed, it should be in the form of paying a lower price (therefore lowering the principal required to acquire the security) instead of accepting a higher coupon or dividend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safety is measured by the ability of the issuer to meet obligations - not by contractual rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in theory, if a business fails, the bondholder recovers his money from assets, but that often fails because:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;property values shrink when the business fails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is difficulty in establishing legal rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are inherent delays in receivership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to avoid trouble is better to seek protection after it occurs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt should bed assessed from the cashflow statement
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“good” debt is when the company is using financed capital for an opportunity or expansion that might require a quick entry into the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“bad” debt is when the business is required to borrow to sustain operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds should be bought on their ability to withstand a depression or recession; relative safety is found in companies of a) dominant size and b) substantial margin or earnings over bond interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presumption of safety based upon either the character of the industry or the amount of protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors should look for industries least likely to be affected by depression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment practice recognizes the importance of the character of the industry. &lt;strong&gt;historically, some industries and public utilities have been more stable than others, and equally, their degree of stability has altered with time&lt;/strong&gt;. This changing dynamic must be considered when assessing an organization’s ability to continue meeting future payments on fixed-income securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depression performance as a test of merit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various causes of bond collapses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the excessive funded debt of utilities: defaults were caused by over-extended debt, not by lack of earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stability of railroad earnings overrated: such as diminished earnings and a failure to recognize changes in transportation methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unavailability of sound bonds is no excuse for buying poor ones. The investor should never be tempted by the lack of a good opportunity to venture into a poor one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are two incorrect theories:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that issuing a bond is a statement of financial weakness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds are only issued when companies cannot issue stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proper theory of bond financing: A reasonable amount of funded debt is an advantage (typically rooted in the company’s ability to quickly take their product or service to market). If the company needs to issue debt to pay its bills and expenses, this is a signal that the bond is unsafe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the significance of the foregoing to the investor: whenever money is available, it is invested. When higher-yielding securities disappear from the market, analysts need to accept a lower-yielding security to ensure the protection of the principal instead of choosing more yield in a second-rate issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lack of safety is not compensated by a high dividend or coupon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no mathematical relationship between yield and risk: prices and yields often depend on popularity. Graham suggests that the public’s familiarity with the issuing company and its ability to be quickly sold on the market is an essential factor in the market price of bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the factor of cyclical risks: an insurance company spreads the risk over a large field; the investor has only a small field and cannot afford a program entailing a small sample size with a significant risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk and yield are incommensurable. Graham mentions, yet again, that the analyst should not pay a par value for a risky bond that has a high yield. Instead, he should pay a considerable discount below the par value, minimizing his principal risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a reversal of customary procedure is recommended: don’t start with inspecting the safest fixed-income issues on a list and work down. Instead, start with the security that represents a minimum safety threshold and work up on the list. This way, the analyst protects themselves from going deeper into the list - likely resulting in the purchase of an unsafe issue.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Graham recommends implementing similar rules and regulations that savings banks use for fixed-income investments since they are required and obligated by law to minimize their risk exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham recommends New York Savings Bank as the baseline, but the rules should be regarded loosely and amended if new metrics prove more useful and secure&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obligations of foreign governments
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham agreed with the decision to disallow the purchase of foreign bonds for the following reasons:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the factor of political expediency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the foreign trade argument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the individual record argument: it is suggested some countries are more creditworthy than others. Graham argues that only Canada, Holland, and Switzerland demonstrated “unquestionable investing ratings” during his era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two-fold objection to purchasing foreign government bonds. Generally speaking, foreign bonds should be avoided for two reasons
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the basis for obtaining credit is fragile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the past performance is unsatisfactory. Graham then provides Canada as the sole exception to his doubts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds of foreign corporations: in theory, no company should do better than the country it is located because the government could declare state ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small companies and municipalities are vulnerable, and their bonds should not be considered suitable for the conservative investor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NYSB criteria example. Municipal bonds required a population of 10000 in adjacent states and 30000 elsewhere; railroads had to have 500 miles of track and annual operating revenues of 10 million nominal dollars, etc…
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham agrees that the issuer should be of reasonable size, and he also suggests that the underlying theory of cash flow and the ability to repay the holder of the security is more meaningful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial bonds and factor of size: Graham feels these bonds are safe if tested against strict standards. He recommends limiting selections to the six largest corporations in any particular industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;large size alone, no guarantee of safety; the size should not be applied to municipalities and utilities but only to industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NYSB only accepts public utility bonds when secured by mortgages. An exception is made for unsecured railroad and income bonds if earnings and dividend records meet severe stipulated rules. Graham argues that the company’s ability to meet its obligations is the top consideration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;income bonds in a weaker position than debentures. Debentures are required to make payments, whereas income bonds are not required. As a result, Graham believes the mandatory coupon payment for a debenture provides less risk to the holder than an income bond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;standards of safety should not be relaxed because of early maturity if the same company issued and secured two different short-term and long-term bonds. The risk is no different for either bond if the short-term issue can’t be paid at maturity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the investor should ensure the bond issuer has a long record of financial stability and avoid those without a history of success. NYSBs require ten years’ history of payments on issues from other states and 25 years’ history from municipalities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors should not take higher returns for risk. Instead, they should pay a lower principal. For example, when a municipal government issues new bonds at higher interest rates because of the risk of default, the investor should be skeptical of such investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strict quantitative tests would focus on population size, the revenues received and current liabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dividend record not conclusive evidence of financial strength&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance sheet and income statement provide better clues about a company’s ability to meet future coupon payments than historical dividend performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the dividend is withheld or reduced to the common shareholders, the health of the bond may be in jeopardy&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the safety of a bond can be evaluated by comparing the company’s earnings to its interest obligations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total deduction or “Overall” Method
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests that all bonds depend on each other. He expects all issues to fail if the payment of one cannot be completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coverage ratio = earnings / total interests on all issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minimum requirements for earnings coverage. It’s different for each industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;period comprised of the earnings test. NYSB assesses the five previous years for determining the safety of an issue. Graham suggests that the most recent years are the most important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the relation of the coupon rate to earnings coverage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effect of coupon rate on safety: good companies fetch lower interest rates than risky companies. This means that good credit produces better credit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effect of rising interest rates on safety
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the investor considers a rise in interest rates probable, he should not buy long-term low-coupon bonds, no matter how strong the company is. Inversely, if an investor considers a drop in interest rates, he should buy long-term bonds that meet significant levels of safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the soundness of the bond rests on the ability of the issuing corporation to support its financial obligations and much less on the potential value of its property for a lien. With that in mind, there is no purpose in devising a minimal pledged level of property value to support the bond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;special types of obligations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;equipment obligations&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equipment trust certificates may be issued against specific items of use by the corporation, for instance, against, a car. Although these certificates promise safety at the time of sale, the debtor may only receive 50% of what he expects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;collateral-trust bonds&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these are bonds secured by common stock or other bonds, often of the same corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these bonds offer very little security if issued from the same corporation or subsidiary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real estate bonds&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the value of the property is often directly related to the corporation’s success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;property values and earning power are closely related. Graham forcefully cautions investors that this is not true for buildings that were erected for special purposes and manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the misleading character of appraisals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abnormal rental used as the basis of valuation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt based on excessive construction costs: over-valuation led to over-building, raising construction costs. When the market caught up, the loan against the expensive costs could not be supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weakness of specialized buildings such as hospitals or factory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;values based on initial rentals misleading: rentals obtained on a new building are higher than can be obtained for an old building. The duration of the bond issue needs to account for a declining premium for rent due to the age of the building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suggested rules of procedure
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for single-family dwellings, the lender should be sure the amount lent is not more than two-thirds the value of the property as determined by the market assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the lender should fully understand the costs associated with constructing the property and not exceed the mortgage by 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there should be a conservatively structured income account that accounts for vacancies and a building that doesn’t fetch the premium of a newly constructed property. This account should demonstrate quality coverage over the net income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of stock that follows all the different bonds issued by a company (senior and junior issues combined) will always be the resources that remain after all debts are fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;standards prescribed by the new york law&lt;/strong&gt; for the bonds of public utilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all combined mortgage debt will be less than 60% of the assessed property value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capital stock (or the common stock and preferred stock combined) at book value will not be less than two-thirds of mortgaged debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;equity test of doubtful merit in the case of utilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham states that many of the figures used on the balance sheets were unreliable during his era. He feels the test should be used if the company’s earnings are unreliable. In such cases, the analyst may want to increase the standards for test
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;75% of the property value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;importance of a real-value coverage behind a bond issue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham encourages the analyst to ensure the “going concern value” (or the market price if the company could be sold as a whole unit) is substantially higher than the funded debt. He challenges the analyst to look at the value of the business itself instead of its pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;shareholders’ equity measured by the market value of stock issues - a supplemental test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham states that a company with a large market price compared to its total debt is far safer than a company with a lower market price closely resembling its total debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;minima for the stock-equity test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public utilities -&gt; earnings should be 1.75 times the debt’s interest. The market price of the stock should be at least 50% of the total debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;railroads -&gt; earnings should be two times the interest of the debt. The market price of the stock should be 66% of the total debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrials -&gt; earnings should be three times for industrials. The market price of the stock should be 100% of the total debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these tests were developed to determine a bond’s safety, not common stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;income bonds equivalent to stock equity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since interest on income bonds (issues that aren’t required to pay coupons) is not a fixed charge, it should not be included in the total charges on which coverage is calculated. Similarly, the principal amount of such bonds is not to be included in the total funded debt. Instead, it is to be compared with the stock equity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;significance of unusually large stock-value ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the consideration of a bond’s security is primarily based on its coverage ratio (earnings compared to fixed interest charges) and its stock value ratio to total bonded debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the coverage ratio provides the coverage of the coupon payment, and the ratio of stock value to total bonded debt indicates whether the par value can be repaid. The issue may still be safe when either of these ratios is uncharacteristically high while the other is low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stock-value ratio for railroad and public utility companies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;applying a stock value ratio to railroads and public utility companies is difficult because of rental obligations and preferred stock of subsidiaries that rank before the parent company’s bonds. Regardless of those difficulties, Graham states that close attention to the stock-value ratio would have prevented major mistakes by bond investors in 1935-1937&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stock-value test not to be modified to reflect changing market conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysts might be inclined to adjust the stock-value ratio with changing market conditions (because it uses the current market price). For example, during a bull market, market prices are higher, but the total debt of a bond is fixed. Therefore a ratio of 2:1 should potentially be increased to 3:1 during growing market prices. Graham suggests practical application is too challenging to implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of minimum quantitative requirements suggested for fixed-value investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s important to note that the following recommendations were from the 1930s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the size of the issuing organization: Municipal bonds should be from a local government with more than 10000 tax-paying citizens. For businesses, they should produce annual gross revenues of $2 million for public utilities, $3 million for railroads, and $5 million for industrial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interest coverage is the comparison of earnings to fixed debt obligations. The seven years average interest coverage for each of the following enterprises is 1.75 times the fixed debt for public utility bonds, two times for railroad bonds, three times for industrial bonds, and 2 times for real estate bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the value of the property: the fair value of the property should be more than 50% of the bond’s par value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the market value of the stock issues: This compares the company’s stock market price to its total bonded debt. The stock price should be at least 50% of a public utilities bonded debt, 66% of a railroad’s bonded debt, and 100% of an industrial’s bonded debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham encourages investors to find companies with large working capital because it displays a healthy organization that can meet future debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parent company only vs consolidated return&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham identifies his deep distrust for the parent company’s operational subsidiary relationship concerning how the income statement is reported. He briefly describes and shows on a chart how the coverage ratio is drastically different when the income statement is viewed from the consolidated report to the “parent company only” report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dividends on preferred stocks of subsidiaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham provides an example where a parent company fails and goes into receivership. Before the failure, the parent company had a subsidiary paying a preferred share dividend. After the failure, the dividend was immediately discontinued. The event left the parent company’s bondholder (debenture holder) empty-handed. The example demonstrates the importance of thoroughly understanding this structure’s prioritization and having backed security.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subsidiaries’ bond interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subsidiaries’ preferred dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parent company’s bond interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;minority interest in the common stock of subsidiaries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the earnings of minority stock are usually deducted from the income statement after the parent company’s bond interest. Therefore, it does not reduce the margin of safety calculation. Graham suggests subtracting the minority interest before calculating the interest coverage for a more conservative estimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;capitalization of fixed charges for railroads and utilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, the railroad industry may lease their cars from other businesses. These leases hold considerable fixed expenses on the company and ultimately impact the health of the bonds the company has issued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after identifying this concern, Graham recommends a rule of thumb for multiplying the fixed charges on the income statement by 22. This would provide a capitalization of 4.5% on all the fixed charges. This was determined by taking the inverse of 22. It’s important to note that interest rates for railroad debts during 1938 were 4.5%. Therefore, this technique could be applied to any industry where fixed charges have numerous variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it would be important to adjust the capitalization rate based on the average rates for bonds in that industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The working-capital factor in the analysis of industrial bonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s important that a company has excess current assets compared to current liabilities. This excess is called working capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 requisites for working capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when assessing the working capital, Graham suggests three items should be evaluated
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cash holdings are ample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ratio of current assets to current liabilities is strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the working capital bears a suitable proportion of funded debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the general rule of thumb is that current assets should be double the current liabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham challenges the industrial bond investor to find companies with enough working capital to cover all the bonds issued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies with large working capital should be favoured without significant working capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some senior securities carry certain privileges that make them attractive purchases on a speculative basis, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Convertible issues” – In some instances, investors can exchange convertible issues for common stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Participating issues” – Investors can receive part of any increased dividend common stockholders earn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Subscription-warrant issues” include option warrants to purchase common stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These issues combine senior security’s increased safety and the common stock’s possible price appreciation. However, as with bonds, the attractive form does not mean that all securities of this type are safe. Only a limited number of such issues meet investment-grade safety requirements; the remainder belongs to the same category as common-stock investments because they share that category’s speculative features. When evaluating privileged issues, consider the amount of the profit-sharing benefits per dollar invested, the proximity of the event that will trigger profit-sharing advantages and the duration of the privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;criteria-for-investing-in-common-stocks&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#criteria-for-investing-in-common-stocks&quot; aria-label=&quot;criteria for investing in common stocks permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Criteria for Investing in Common Stocks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common stocks, as a class, are much more speculative than senior issues. Yet they are important to the US financial system, and novice and expert investors eagerly follow their prices, so security analysts know how to deal with them. The false belief that common stocks were a good buy at any price – as long as the company’s earning trend was positive – partly fueled the crash of 1929. Clearly, the practice of making common-stock investments safer deserves further analysis, because the possibility of significant price appreciation will always lure investors to this type of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the instability of common stock prices makes any given organization a dubious investment, portfolio diversification can somewhat offset this risk. Investors should subject their common stock portfolios to thorough analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty regarding future growth is usually the main reason why value estimations based on present value calculations are so prone to error&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theory-of-common-stock-investment&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#theory-of-common-stock-investment&quot; aria-label=&quot;theory of common stock investment permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;theory of common stock investment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment in common stock is often speculative, and analysis may be inconclusive and unsatisfactory.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;common stock is of basic importance and enormous interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the owners of the common stock with to know their value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;human nature often masks the logic behind an endless cycle of greed for profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;history of common stock analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: over the previous 30 years (from 1910-1940), common stocks have become more favoured due to their substantial earnings and dividends. With more and more companies providing detailed financial information, investors have had statistical data to substantiate their investments. During 1927-1929, Graham says most investors neglected this analysis and purchased more common stock based on speculative greed for profit and prophecy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;analysis vitiated by two types of instability&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests two types of instability will destroy the analysis of common stock:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instability of tangibles aspect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enormous importance placed on intangible aspects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a company’s market price was generally stable and predictable if the companies had the following characteristics:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the company paid a reasonable and consistent dividend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings were stable and averaged a substantial margin over the dividend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each dollar of market price was backed by actual assets of equal value on the balance sheet - Or in other words, the book value was similar to the market price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prewar (WW1) conception of investment in common stocks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before the world war, the analyst was primarily concerned with finding common stocks that paid consistent dividends and possessed stable earnings. Most emphases was placed on past performance and little on future earnings growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speculation characterized by an emphasis on prospects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the technique of investing in common stocks resembled that of bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buying common stocks is viewed as taking a share in a business
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a businessman were going to purchase an entire company outright, he would likely start with the net worth of all the assets (or equity on the balance sheet) and then consider if the choice produced adequate earnings for the price. After looking at the earnings that the company produced, the investor would decide if he was willing to pay a premium or discount to that par value (or book value)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new era theory&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during the roaring 1920s, there was the idea that the value of common stocks was completely dependent on what they will earn in the future. This new thesis had three supporting insights:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dividend holds a little emphasis on the value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the relationship between asset value and earnings power had little significance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the past earnings were of little significant value except when signifying momentum in growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cases for this changed viewpoint&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in short, Graham thinks that the drastic change in common stock valuation stemmed from unpredictable results often seen from using historical data and the irresistible potential for profits that had occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the early 1930s many liquidations occurred. These events often produced very little value for the companies’ fixed assets listed on their balance sheets. This experience also caused investors to abandon the emphasis on book value or net work of assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;attention shifted to the trend of earnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the common stocks as long-term investments doctrine&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;few key points
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the value was based on what the common stock could earn in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good common stocks have rising earnings (or EPS)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what it excludes is the idea that a price is associated with the earnings one can expect to receive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relies on an improvement in the stock’s future performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore approaching &lt;strong&gt;speculative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new era investment equivalent to prewar speculation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stocks regarded as attractive irrespective of their prices&lt;/strong&gt;: non-sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment trusts came to resemble this new doctrine
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analysis abandoned by investment trusts. Graham voices his disgust for the professional investor who didn’t safeguard the capital of their customers due to a lazy assessment of facts and risk analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a sound premise used to support an unsound conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 1924, a book by the name common stocks as long-term investments by Edgar Lawrence smith was published. The premise of the book is that common stocks outperform bonds because not all the earnings are paid to the owners as dividends. These retained earnings by the company make the value of the common stock increase in market price. Although Graham agreed with the basic tenants of Edgar’s thesis, he strongly disagreed with the exaggeration many investors took in their application of his ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;average vs trend of earnings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests that earnings trends and earning averages are nothing more than speculative tools for analysts to predict future results. Companies that have accelerated growth demonstrate an untapped market for more competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;secular expansion as basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a diversified portfolio of common stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when recessions occur, the investor can still benefit in the common stock markets by 1) diversifying their portfolio and 2) adamantly rejecting the common stock trade for excessive premiums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham says the investor cannot rely on historical earnings growth to provide safety and profit in the long haul. Specifically, he’s talking about companies that are commonly referred to as “growth picks”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;individual growth as the basis of sections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use quantitative and qualitative factors to determine the value of common stocks similar to the techniques for bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are growth companies?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe a company whose earnings move forward from cycle to cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe the company’s earnings grow at a faster rate than the general market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can investor identifies them?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no, the typical investors can’t really determine when and where the company’s growth will eventually subside. As a result, there’s a strong chance that the investor might select the stock “at the top of the earnings wave”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does the price discount the potential growth?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s difficult to determine the price to pay for future earnings that haven’t been demonstrated yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s impossible to predict how much longer the earnings growth will take. One thing almost everyone can agree on is that high earnings growth (like 30%) is temporary and not sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;may such purchases be described as investment commitments
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can thorough analysis and thought to go into the selection of the growth stock?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe yes, as some growth investors do conduct themselves appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is the price paid for the investment something that a reasonable person would pay if they could buy the whole business?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a person is willing to pay more than 20% more for a common stock than he would for outright ownership of the entire business, the pick becomes speculative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;utilize even more effort than bonds to assess the future outlook of common stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;selection based on the margin of safety principle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;factors complicating efforts to exploit general market swings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;index of leading stocks was selected and analyzed as a group (like the S&amp;#x26;P 500). Also, a base or normal value for the group of stocks could be determined by taking their average earnings and capitalizing them at the going long-term interest rate (like the 10 or 30-year federal bond). This is where Graham tells analysts that the intrinsic value of stocks is directly tied to interest rates.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this approach has three drawbacks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first, the general market patterns may be anticipated, but the buying and selling points may still be chosen poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market behaviour may change in the future and not respond in the same manner as before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this approach requires a very determined and vigilant individual because his actions will be the opposite of human psychology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the undervalued individual issue approach:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the likelihood of finding an individual common stock that possesses the qualitative factors and the quantitative factors (compared to price) is rare. if this type of stock issue is found, Graham says it should be classified as an investment, not speculation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham says the most important way to view the purchase of common stock is if the investor could purchase the entire business at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-dividends&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1-dividends&quot; aria-label=&quot;1 dividends permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. Dividends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before investing in a common stock, investigate the firm’s dividend rate and its history of paying dividends. The dividend rate is important because a dollar of surplus earnings is worth more to the investor when the company chooses to pay it as a dividend instead of reinvesting it in the business. Generally, companies that pay higher dividends have higher stock prices. However, management can suspend common-stock dividends at any time, so it is important to view the company’s dividend history as an indication, but not a guarantee, of future income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extraordinary stock dividends&lt;/strong&gt; (stock splits), on the other hand, are largely illusory because they give investors nothing they did not already own. An improvement in this practice is for companies to pay periodic stock dividends, representing a return to the shareholders of surplus earnings reinvested in the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although stock dividends and stock splits create no real value for the holders, much speculation about the value of the companies after the division is likely to occur due to the lower price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;periodic stock dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with a periodic stock dividend, the shareholder often receives a smaller and more reasonable stock dividend that adds value over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company should not provide a periodic stock dividend if the amount exceeds the funds retained in earnings. The dividend could eventually exceed the company’s ability to retain earnings power, and the EPS slowly declined over a 10-year period, along with the market price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests the dividend should be dispersed as a preferred share.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it doesn’t weaken the business’s capital structure like the common stock dividend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows the company to retain earnings until a safe and manageable surplus is realized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this technique gives management flexibility and control to pay the dividend as long as they choose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once the retained earnings have been distributed, the obligation is no longer on the books once the company repurchases the preferred share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham suggests that the market price of common stocks will perform similarly if management pays a healthy and sustainable dividend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;established principle of withholding dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham claims that two companies with the same general business model and the same earnings will trade at different prices if the dividend policy is different. The market will value the company with the higher dividend more favourably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should a company pay a lower dividend to create stability for the owner with an assured payment, or should it pay a higher dividend and meet its obligation irregularly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the merits of “plowing back” earnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’re two reasons retained earnings are beneficial to the stockholder.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whatever was good for the company was good for the shareholder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a company that retained earnings had more agility to remain competitive in difficult markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a company sustains a favourable ROE over a long period, it means the management is properly investing the retained earnings and adding value to the shareholder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dividend policies arbitrary and sometimes selfishly determined&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests that many board members are executives and friends of executives with very large portions of shares. As a result, they might want to minimize their tax burden by receiving smaller dividends from the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leadership may seek a larger and more impressive sized business, therefore, using retained earnings to full fill their pursuit of an ever-growing business (which may or may not add more earnings)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;management may seek the opportunity to purchase outstanding shares at lower prices with the retained earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;management that pays a small dividend can pay excessive salaries to executives and top-level employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;arbitrary control of dividend policy complicates the analysis of common stocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;suggested principle for dividend payments&lt;/strong&gt;: Graham strongly believes that a company should pay a large portion of their earnings to the shareholders. He says it’s more important for the shareholder to receive non-standard (or inconsistent) dividend rates at a higher return instead of a lower and more consistent dividend, which likely results in the company accumulating reserves that add little value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-earnings&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2-earnings&quot; aria-label=&quot;2 earnings permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. Earnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze earnings, carefully study the company’s income statement. While earnings are undoubtedly important, security analysts have accorded them too much weight in calculating a company’s investment soundness. Management can manipulate a company’s earnings in many ways. Therefore, always examine the firm’s income statement with a critical eye. For example, businesses can engineer nonrecurring charges and profits to produce a favourable earnings trend. A firm’s accountants also can generate perceived earnings by lowering or increasing the company’s reserves or by reporting subsidiaries’ results in different ways. Companies can also misleadingly present depreciation and amortization costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors must pay attention to more than current earnings. They should consider both the earnings trend and the long-term earnings average – preferably seven to ten years, putting more weight on the latter number. The analyst’s job is not predicting the future of a trend or intuiting possible price changes; it is making decisions based on facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts should combine the information from the balance sheet and income statement to garner the best valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;disadvantages of sole emphasis on earning power&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings statement has more variability than the balance sheet and therefore changes the value of the business, making it appear unstable. The income statement can be more misleading than the balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;simplified statement of Wall Street’s Method of appraising common stocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;price = Current Earnings Per Share (EPS) x Quality Coefficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how does the quality coefficient is determined?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probably by a whole host of factors such as dividend rate, history, size and reputation of the business. Graham suspects all these factors are dwarfed by the real factor, which is the earnings trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;earnings not only fluctuate but are subject to arbitrary determination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some of the techniques management can use to misrepresent earnings in the short term are the following
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through allocating items to surplus (on the balance sheet) instead of revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through misrepresented amortization charges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through an amendment of the capital structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through the use of large capital funds for items that don’t pertain to the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;significance of foregoing to the analyst&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the end, the analyst should be able to answer three questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the true earnings for the period studied?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what indications does the earnings record carry as to the future earning power?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what standards should be applied to the income statement to arrive at a reasonable valuation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;criticism and restatement of the income account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the analyst will need to pay close attention to the ambiguous way the account rules can be applied
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-recurrent profits and losses. This is a one-time or highly infrequent profit or loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operations of subsidiaries and affiliates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reserves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general observations on the income account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accounting rules permit management a range of choices in recording non-recurrent and special items, selecting between income and surplus. Such items may be:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;profit or loss on sale of fixed assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;profit or loss on sale of marketable securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discount or premium on the retirement of capital obligations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proceeds of life insurance policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tax refunds and interest on refunds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gain or loss from litigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extraordinary write-down of inventory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extraordinary write-down of receivables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cost of maintaining non-operating properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the above items must be separated from the ordinary operating results to indicate earning power clearly (what the company might be expected to earn if the business condition remained similar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non-recurrent items: profits or losses from the sale of fixed assets&lt;/strong&gt;: these are not to be shown in current net income. They should appear in the surplus account&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;profit from the sale of marketable securities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;must be separated from ordinary operating results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;methods used by investment trusts in reporting the sale of marketable securities: overall changes in principal value are the only measure of an investment trust’s performance, and this cannot be equated with recorded earnings of an industrial corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;profits through the repurchase of senior securities at a discount&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a corporation may buy back its securities at less than par value; any gain made is non-recurring and should be recorded as such. This was a feature of the depression years 1931-33&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as inventory losses are directly related to the conduct of the business, Graham suggests that they should not be treated as extraordinary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;manufactured earnings&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one example such as receivables and inventory written down to an artificially low “cost price,” which in turn will lead to a manufactured higher profit in the year to come. This illustrates the most vicious type of accounting manipulation: taking sums out of surplus and then reporting these same sums as income in the following years. The danger of this accounting method is that the public is not likely to recognize it, and even the expert analyst might have difficulty detecting it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reserves for inventory loss&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies continuously set aside reserves to absorb losses on inventory before they occur. The implication is that the income statement does not always reflect inventory losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;other elements in inventory accounting&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the standard procedure is to take inventory at the close of the year, measured by the lowest cost price or market price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last-in, first-out: measure the amount paid for the most recently acquired inventory. The theory behind this method is that a merchant’s selling price is related mainly to the current replacement price or the recent cost of the article sold. This method may be useful to reduce income tax if there is inventory fluctuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the normal stock or basic-stock inventory method: a more radical method of minimizing fluctuations is the company must possess a certain physical stock of materials from year to year. This “permanent stock” would therefore keep the same value and not be imposed on price changes. To permit the base inventory to be carried at an unchanging figure on the balance sheet, the practice is to mark it down to a very low unit price, so low that it should never be necessary to reduce it further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;idle-plant expense&lt;/strong&gt;: the cost of carrying non-operating properties is almost always charged against income. Graham suggests it should not. Doing so, it’s misleading to the expenses of the company’s core product or service. The analyst may properly consider the idle-plant expense as belonging somewhat different from ordinary charges against operating income, as these expenses, by nature, are not part of the company’s normal operations.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in theory, these expenses should be temporary since the management can terminate these losses at any time by disposing of the property. Therefore, if the company chose to spend the money, Graham does not deem it logical to consider these assets equivalent to a permanent liability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deferred charges&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a business sometimes incurs expenses which apply to a number of years rather than a single 12-month period, such as:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organization expenses (legal fees, etc…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moving expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;development expenses (for new products, processes, opening up a mine, etc…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discount on obligations sold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the company is allowed to spread these types of costs over an appropriate period of years (5 years is a customary period). It is entered upon balance sheets as deferred charges, which are written off by annual charges against earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is incorrect to write off these types of expenses in a single year and against a ‘surplus’ as net income for coming years would be overstated, followed by the understated operating expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amortization of bond discount&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the discount should be amortized over the bond’s life by an annual charge against earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the write-offs could be written against surplus to eliminate future annual deductions from earnings and in that way, to make the shares appear more valuable. This practice has aroused considerable criticism in recent years both from NYSE and from S.E.C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Earnings of subsidiaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the parent company has an unprofitable division, its losses must be shown as a deduction from normal earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;flagrant example of padded income accounts&lt;/strong&gt;: on rare occasions, management would include earnings in the income statement that have no existence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;balance sheet and income-tax checks upon the published earnings statements&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to check upon the reliability of the published earnings is to look at the amount of federal income tax accrued. The taxable profit can be calculated from the income-tax accrual, which is compared in turn with the earnings reported to stockholders. The two figures should not necessarily be the same since the tax laws may give rise to some divergences. However, the wide differences should be noted and made the subject of further inquiry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one cannot make a quantitative deduction to allow unscrupulous management; the only way to deal with such situations is to avoid them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subsidiary companies and consolidated reports&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consolidated reports occur when an enterprise controls one or more operational subsidiaries so that it can disclose companies’ financial reports as a ‘group’ or one entity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the important part of consolidation is to ensure nothing is counted twice, for example, the subsidiary’s profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;special dividends paid by subsidiaries&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parent companies can supplement their earnings through special dividends paid by their subsidiaries. This can be very misleading to an analyst, who needs to account for this in their evaluation process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;broader significance of subsidiaries’ losses&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should a subsidiary’s losses be represented on the parent company’s earnings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should the analyst discount the value of the parent company if they own an unprofitable interest in another company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is clear from the standpoint of proper accounting that as long as a company continues to control an unprofitable division, its losses must be shown as a deduction from normal earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the amount involved is significant, the analyst should investigate whether or not the losses may be subject to early termination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the analyst may consider all or part of the subsidiary’s losses equivalent to nonrecurring items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;leading questions relative to depreciation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a capital asset has a limited life, provisions must be made to write off the cost of the asset by charges against earnings distributed throughout the asset’s life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;three complications arise
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accounting rules may permit a value other than cost to acquire the asset as the basis for amortization charges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are numerous ways a company can execute their depreciation/amortization charges from the balance sheet to the income statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes, account rules allow companies to make depreciation charges which don’t represent the reality of assets depreciation over time. This makes the analysts’ job very difficult to assess capital expenditures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depreciation base other than cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests substituting the replacement value of all the fixed assets at a given date while everything prior is depreciated according to current accounting standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in most cases, companies don’t place much interest in ensuring their depreciation charges represent their assets’ ever-changing replacement costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mark-downs to reduce depreciation charges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham believes that excessive write-downs of fixed assets are inexcusable and should not be condoned by the accounting profession. Accountants should refuse to certify a report containing such mark-downs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;balance sheet-income account discrepancies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prevalent in the case of mining and oil companies, it is to mark up fixed assets and then fail to increase the corresponding depreciation charges on the income statement. This is done to benefit from the higher valuation in their balance sheet without accepting the burden of consequently higher depreciation charges against net income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the vast majority of industrial companies follow the standard policy or charing an appropriate depreciation rate against each class of depreciable assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the analyst knows that a company’s depreciation policy differs from the standard, there is a special reason to check the adequacy of the allowance. Comparison with a company in the same field may yield significant differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;depreciation charges are often an issue in mergers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;concealed depreciation, such as understated depreciation, hence overstating the earnings power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amortization charges of oil and mining companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depletion charges of mining companies&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depletion represents using capital assets by turning them into products for sale. It applies to companies producing metals, oil and gas, sulphur, timber, etc… As the holdings, or reserves, of these products, are gradually exhausted, their value must gradually be written off through charges against earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;independent calculation by investor necessary&lt;/strong&gt;: in mining, the investor must ordinarily compute his depletion allowances for his share of the mining property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depletion and similar charges in the oil industry:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the oil industry, depletion charges are closer related to the actual cost of doing business. Large oil producers normally spend substantial sums of capital each year on new leases and wells. This is needed to make up for the shrinkage of reserves throughout continued production. In general, depletion charges are cash outlays to maintain reserves and production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham then provides an assessment of how some oil companies would misrepresent the actual lifetime of the asset by extending or shortening the depletion and depreciation of their assets. This was typically exercised so the company could control the market price through earnings manipulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the meaning of these variations to the analyst and the investor&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analyst should seek to apply a uniform and reasonably conservative rate of amortization that reflects the realities of fixed assets.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depreciation on tangible assets. This should always be applied to cost - or a figure substantially less than cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intangible drilling costs. Capitalizing these costs and then writing them off as oil is produced is the preferable basis for comparative purposes and to supply a fair reflection of current earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;property retirement and abandoned leases. A loss on the property should be charged against the year’s earnings rather than against the surplus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depletion of oil reserves. The proper principle here is that the analyst should allow for depletion based on the current market values of the oil.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of integrated oil companies, accept the company’s depletion figure as the best available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In companies that are solely or virtually oil producers, the analyst can compute what the market is paying for the total developed oil reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;other types of amortization of capital assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;leaseholds and leasehold improvements&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a lessee is renting a property at a large discount to the actual cost of owning the property - and the terms of the contract are over a long period - there may be significant value to account for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oil lands are leased on a standard royalty basis, usually one-eighth of the production. Such leaseholds can be worth much more than the rental payments involved. If a company has paid money for a given leasehold, the cost is regarded as a capital investment that should be written off during the life of the lease. These charges are part of the rent paid for the property and must therefore be included in the current operating expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the leased property is improved with assets fixed by the lease, the cost must be written down to nothing during the life of the lease. This is due to the landlord ultimately owning the property and the tethered asset when the lease expires. The annual expense for this purpose is called “amortization of leasehold improvements.” Chain-store enterprises, and consequently, the annual write-offs may be of significant importance in their income statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amortization of patent&lt;/strong&gt;: in theory, a patent should be dealt with the same way as a mining property; i.e., its cost to the investor should be written off against earnings during its remaining life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amortization of goodwill&lt;/strong&gt;: in modern accounting. Goodwill is continually tested for impairment but isn’t amortized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inadequate depreciation revealed by transfer from surplus and reserves, such as in the case of Brooklyn Union Gas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;variety of depreciation policies&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depreciation Proper&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Straight-line method&lt;/em&gt;: each class of depreciable property is written down by equal annual charges during the period of its estimated life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;sinking-fund method&lt;/em&gt;: the effect of this method is to make the deductions somewhat smaller in the earlier years and correspondingly higher in the later years. This is because depreciation is assumed to earn interest until the property is retired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;the overall method&lt;/em&gt;: single annual percentage to the entire depreciable property account is used, instead of varying rates to different classes of assets. The object is to arrive at a simple approximation of the actual depreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;retirement reserve methods&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a retirement reserve intends to have funds available when an asset retires. Over any long period, proper depreciation and proper retirement allowances should yield the same results. In reality, the majority of retirement reserve policies operate simply to understate the current loss of property value and thus overstate the earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various methods of calculating retirement reserves are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;percentage of gross&lt;/em&gt;. this method would tend to approximate a regular depreciation rate if the percentage taken were adequate. Generally, this is not the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;fixed rate per unit of product&lt;/em&gt;. This method resembles the previous one and is subject to the same criticism. Instead of a percentage of gross product, an example used is $2.7 in depreciation for every thousand kilowatt-hours sold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall percentage of Gross for maintenance and depreciation combined&lt;/em&gt;. By this method, the larger the amount spent for maintenance, the smaller the amount saved in reserve for depreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;discretionary deductions&lt;/em&gt;. The annual deduction is largely based on the judgement of the management. It might be the same or varying amount from year to year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;double accounting policies on depreciation.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regardless of what method is followed in the annual reports, practically every company follows the straight-line basis of depreciation in computing its income tax. As a result, the investor must determine whether the depreciation is representative of the linear or non-linear erosion that takes place on the value of the asset over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reasons for accepting, in general, the income tax base&lt;/em&gt;. Graham presents five major reasons for accepting the income tax figure rather than the income statement as the basis of depreciation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the straight-line basis follows a definite and logical accounting theory. If there is an excessive deduction, the Treasure Department won’t’ accept it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the inadequacy of the “retirement reserve” idea has been shown by the necessity in many cases of making large transfers from surplus to support the retirement reserve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since 1934, there has been an almost universal increase in retirement allowances. This can be perceived as a strong indicator that past allowances were too small and, therefore an overstatement of earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some state commissions and federal commissions have now ordered companies within their jurisdictions to follow the income tax depreciation base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;instance when income tax basis should be rejected or questioned.&lt;/em&gt; while Graham generally believes in accepting income tax basis, there may be times when figures in the annual report should be accepted, or even seek the third basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;problem indicated by hypothetical example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;typical market appraisals
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a company with less valuable assets in terms of accounting is worth considerably more than a company with a higher value asset. This is done by a single gesture of writing down company C’s assets to almost nothing immediately upon the purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;a more rational approach&lt;/em&gt;. A more practical approach would be to include the fair value of the respective assets and add that to the cash holdings. The investor might consider which depreciation method should be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;practical application of foregoing reasoning.&lt;/strong&gt; depreciation is not a cash outlay but deducted as an expense on the income statement. As a result, the company reports no income, yet the cash account continues to grow because the displayed income is offset by depreciation charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to determine the proper depreciation charge&lt;/em&gt; the investor or the analyst must come up with an estimate for depreciation which aligns with the actual conditions of the business (based on the discoverable facts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;concept of expended depreciation&lt;/em&gt;. The primary reason for reducing a company’s depreciation charges is that it doesn’t properly reflect the company’s cash flow. In short, as an asset’s life continues to get older, the value that it is listed on the company’s balance sheet will continue to decrease. As a result, an investor should see the value of tangible and intangible assets slowly decrease over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;long-term depreciation a form of obsolescence&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, a plant may not be wearing out but rather being obsolete due to changes in the industry and the status of the corporation. This risk is rather due to the investment and not accounting. Hence it should be incorporated in the price and not in the depreciation, as it is a business risk. Therefore, the carrying value of the asset should be adjusted accordingly. The company’s management should conduct this value test for asset impairment quarterly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application of foregoing in determining earning power&lt;/em&gt;. For companies similar to a railroad, only the expended depreciation should be deducted from earnings due to maintenance, renewals and repair to a large degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depreciation on apartment and office buildings&lt;/strong&gt;. In short, the asset can’t be depreciated for more than the price paid to acquire it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inadequate allowance for depreciation&lt;/strong&gt;. Assets should not be written down in large amounts early in the assets’ life to make the earnings power appear more abundant during the assets’ final years of life. This represents the true cash flow of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stock watering reversed&lt;/strong&gt;. This manipulation of asset value by writing the book value up and down is interrelated with the value of the stock. This would inflate the stock prices by the higher book value of the fixed assets (known as &lt;em&gt;stock watering&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The purchases’ amortization calculation&lt;/strong&gt;. Where the life of a mining property is limited, the investor’s calculation of amortization should be deducted from earnings. He can base this on three factors 1) the price paid for the mining property. 2) the earnings before depreciation and depletion 3) the minimum life of the mine, and alternatively, the probability of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;purchaser amortization of oil reserves&lt;/strong&gt;. Depreciation and depletion charges per barrel are found by dividing the estimated remaining oil reserves into the net value of the properties on the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;purchaser’s amortization of patents&lt;/strong&gt;. The question for the investor is how much she is paying for the patent when she buys the stock at a given price. This is the amount she must use for writing-off subsequent earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;general rule&lt;/em&gt;. In reality, no single calculation shown above will represent stocks wholistically. For big companies, it is even harder since they have a bulk of patents and intangible items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;special cases&lt;/em&gt;. In some special cases, when a company’s business primarily collects royalties on a patent or a group of patents, some finite provisions can be made. This provision must be related to the price the investor paid for his interest in the patent and not to the book value of the patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;concept of earning power&lt;/strong&gt;: the average earnings per share should be seen over several years. One should notice if the observed years are all surrounded by the average. This is preferred to very volatile earnings, as repeated occurrences are more impressive than a single occurrence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;quantitative analysis should be supplemented by qualitative considerations:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;quantitative data is useful only to the extent that it’s supported by a qualitative survey of the enterprise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the steel company example, while current and past earnings are one thing, Graham aims to calculate ‘normal earnings.’ He suggests that the national steel output and the market position should be considered as part of a qualitative analysis. Reported earnings cannot be viewed without relative factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;current earnings should not be the primary basis of appraisal&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current earnings govern the market price of common stock prices more than the long-term average. While private businesses might earn twice as much as their average years, their local market price would never be purchased based on the extraordinary earnings year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the market price typically corresponds very closely to the earnings regardless of the abnormalities in earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the speculative public shares its vision with Wall Street, it would seem logical to buy the cheap stock at temporarily suppressed earnings and sell them at inflated levels created by the opposite effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The classical formula for “Beating the Stock Market”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Wall Street, the common assumption is that trends are likely to continue or persist regardless of qualitative circumstances. While the analyst, on occasion, can place pre-dominant weight on the recent earnings rather than the average, persuasive evidence has to be present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this strategy is not simple because the market timing is hard, and the underlying values of stocks continuously change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;average vs trend of earnings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;attitude of analyst where trends are upward.&lt;/em&gt; If a qualitative study of company A is positive, which it often should be, the analyst should base future results on a conservative estimate of what the company is currently producing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;attitude of analyst where trends are downward&lt;/em&gt;. The analyst must assign great weight to the unfavourable trend and the reasons why. However, one can’t make a hasty conclusion that this trend will persist either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deficits a qualitative, not a quantitative factor&lt;/strong&gt;: when a company reports a deficit for the year, it is customary to calculate the amount in dollars per share or with interest requirements. This is not a valid approach. Instead, the attention of the analyst should be directed elsewhere.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when an average is taken over a period that includes some deficits, some questions must arise as to whether or not the resultant figure is indicative of the earning power. This is especially true if the company has volatile numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;intuition not a part of the analyst’s stock in trade&lt;/strong&gt;: Unless there is a reason to think otherwise, the record is accepted as a basis for judging the future.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;analysis of the future should be penetrating rather than prophetic&lt;/em&gt;. In short, the investor should not be reliant on the company’s performance to improve to justify a premium price. Instead, the future results should be penetrated to the current capacity to earn and the price the market is trading the stock for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;large profits frequently transitory&lt;/strong&gt;: when capital flows into new industries, it may result in overcapacity and keen competition - dragging profits down for individual companies in the long haul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rate of output and operating costs&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when analyzing an individual company, each governing element in the operating results must be studied for signs of unfavourable changes. Governing elements may vary, but if the analyst was assessing the general factors of a mining company, they might focus on areas like (1) the life of a mine, (2) annual output, (3) production costs and (4) selling price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the future earnings had to be supported by higher costs, it would make the current facts speculative and much riskier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;freeport sulphur company&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the learning point is that a high valuation based on prospects is highly speculative. When the stock market moves away from sound sense and business experience, the common stock buyer will inevitably lose money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the future price of the product&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;change in status of low-cost producers&lt;/em&gt;: when analyzing the individual company, one must also look at the overall cost level and in which direction it can be expected to change. the cost price will be a determinant of the selling price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anomalous prices and the price relationships in the history of the I.R.T system:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the analysis not only showed that the current selling price was far above the value of the stock. It also showed that when there is an upper limit of earnings or value being fixed, there is usually a danger that the actual figure could be less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what happened afterwards for Interborough Rapid Transit System was that earnings were non-recurrent and temporary. As earning power declined, it ran quickly into severe financial problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Adjustments for changes in capitalization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;exact appraisal impossible&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before the bull market of 1927-1929, a price of 10 times earnings was accepted standard for measuring common stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of basing the valuation on current earnings is absurd since earnings are constantly changing. Stock market prices are not carefully computed but are the result of human reactions. A stock market is a voting machine rather than a weighing machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;limited functions of the analyst in the field of stock price appraisal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as facts and human behaviour change, the security analyst must not follow a general rule for his valuations. However, Graham proposes some limited functions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he may set up a basis for conservative or investment valuation of common stocks, as distinguished from speculative valuations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he may point out the significance of (a) the capitalization structure; and (b) the source of income, as bearing upon the valuation of a given stock issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he may find unusual elements in the balance sheet which affect the implications of the earnings picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a suggested basis of maximum appraisal for investment&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the profits of the most recent year might be accepted as an indicator of future earnings if (1) general business conditions in that year were not exceptionally good, (2) the company has shown an upward trend of earnings for some years past and (3) the investor’s study of the industry leaves him confident about its continued growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;note: a P/E of 20 equates to a 5% return - assuming earnings remain constant and are treated as a free cash flow to the shareholder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Higher prices may prevail for speculative commitments&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*other requisites for common stocks of investment grade and a corollary thereof: * as 20 times average earnings are the upper limit, the purchase price for ordinary businesses should be substantially less. 12 or 12.5 times average earnings can be considered a necessary multiplier but not a sufficient condition.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it must be emphasized that many other factors must be present, including the financial setup, not-unsatisfactory prospects and proper management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An attractive common-stock investment is attractive speculation. This is true because if a common stock can meet the demand of a conservative investor, then he gets full value for his money, plus satisfactory prospects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;examples of speculative and investment common stocks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks sold at multiple considerably more than 20 times average earnings. In other words, they all require large future growth to justify the price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks are speculative not because of the average earnings, but the speculative element of the instability of earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks that pass the quantitative tests of investment quality:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings have been reasonably stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;average earnings have a satisfactory ratio to market price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;financial setup is sufficiently conservative, and the working capital position is strong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;allowances for changes in capitalization&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when dealing with records of earnings on a per-share basis, the analyst must adjust to changes in capitalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;allowances for participating interests&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when calculating earnings for the common shareholder, the participating interests must also be included. (participating interests is a new structure dividing income when it increases.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;similar allowances must be made for the effect of management contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general rule&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the intrinsic value of a common stock preceded by convertible securities cannot reasonably be appraised at a higher figure than would be justified if all convertible securities were exercised in full. The same is the case if it is subject to dilution through the exercise of stock options or through participating privileges enjoyed by other senior security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;principle of optimum capitalization structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the optimum capitalization structure for any enterprise includes senior securities to the extent that they may be safely issued and bought for investment. The practical implication is that, under safe circumstances, no debt leads to an inefficient use of the shareholder’s capital. On the other hand, too much debt leaves no room for an appropriate margin of safety, as the interest coverage ratio is very small and risky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this safe environment may be composed of working capital of no less than the bond value and other conditions. Under such circumstances, a very conservative capitalization based only on the shareholders’ equity would make the shareholders’ dollars less productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;corporate practices resulting in a shortage of sound industrial bonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investors generally prefer strongly funded corporation-issued bonds as these offer a wider range of choices and make the sale of unsound bonds less likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the factor of leverage is speculative capitalization structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speculative capitalized enterprises can be sold at high prices during good markets. On the contrary, the same venture might be undervalued during a depression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the real advantage, however, lies in the fact that the stock can advance more than it can decline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;speculative attractiveness of “shoestring” common stocks considered:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;practical aspects of foregoing:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;senior capital for the company should be held in preferred shares rather than in bonds, as this would limit the risk of bankruptcy during bad times, permitting the common stockholder to wait for better times (preferred shares can omit dividend payments, while bonds, in general, are obliged to pay out coupon payments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Analysis of the source of income.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;arithmetical advantage of low-priced issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low priced stocks offer the advantage of being more likely to appreciate than decline. Securities are found to rise more readily from 10 to 40 than from 100-400, and because of this, the speculative public would rather buy into stocks of lower numerical value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some of the reasons most buyers of low-priced issues lose money:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the public may be buying lowed-priced stocks for the bad financial conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high number of shares are issued, which are priced higher than the actual value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insiders’ desire to dispose of their assets, sometimes resulting in rigorous efforts to persuade the unwary public to buy them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;low price coupled with speculative capitalization&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speculatively capitalized enterprises, according to Graham’s definition, are marked by relatively large amounts of senior securities and a comparatively small issue of common stock. Although the common share, in most cases, is sold at a low price, this is not always the case as long as the market value of common stock comprises only a small part of the enterprise value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;large volume and high production cost equivalent to speculative capital structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham shows how high production costs have the same effect as coupon payments for holders of senior securities. The simple effect is that the common stockholders have fewer earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;general principle derived&lt;/em&gt;. It can be derived from the example that when the price of copper increases, there will be a higher profit increase percentage-wise for the high-cost producer than for the low-cost producer. This will be reflected in the share price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sources of income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;special phase: analysis must be conducted for the company based on the source of income from a specific asset and not on the business’s general nature.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;northern pipeline company&lt;/em&gt;: breaking down the sources of income for this company, it can be seen that a substantial part of the income comes from the stable rental and interest earnings. This type of earnings must be evaluated based on the actual value of asset-producing income. Income from bonds should also be valued on a higher basis, compared to the rather volatile pipeline business showing a negative trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;tobacco products Corporation of Virginia&lt;/em&gt;: this company was traded with a price-earnings of 10. All income came from a 99-year lease given to a high-quality company that could meet the obligation without question. This made the source of income from Tobacco Products Company of Virginia equivalent to a high-grade investment bond, and on this basis, the company would be deemed undervalued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Asset Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gauge asset value, inspect the business’s balance sheet. A firm’s book value per share equals the total value of its tangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. Wall Street has almost entirely superseded the importance of asset value with earnings. Although rules of thumb for the proper ratio of market price to book value vary, you still should investigate the underlying value of a business’s assets before investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current-asset value – that is, current assets minus liabilities – is perhaps a more significant number. It excludes both intangible and fixed assets and is, therefore, a rough approximation of the company’s value should it go into liquidation. As a general rule, if a firm’s market price is below its liquidation value, the company has either been undervalued or should be liquidated. Investors who distinguish between the undervalued issues and those performing poorly due to fundamental unsoundness can realize a significant upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, examine the balance sheet to make sure that the company has a good cash position, that its current assets (exclusive of inventories) at least equal its current liabilities, and that it does not have a large amount of debt maturing soon, which could create refinancing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there should be no discount from the amount stated on the company’s books for cash and marketable securities, provided the securities are short-term or marked to the market. The same holds for property, plant, and equipment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the economic value of the assets is the reproduction costs of a new firm starting in the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we first find the current market prices for the securities. Then we must adjust the book value of the firm’s accounts receivable and inventory up or down to get more realistic reproduction costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is important to note that goodwill represents a prior blunder that must be ignored when calculating a company’s intrinsic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;liabilities and equity are the sources of funds that support the assets, which are the uses to which those funds are put&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there are three types of liabilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those that arise from the normal conduct of the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those that arise from past circumstances that are not pertinent to a new entrant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the outstanding formal debt of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we start with the reproduction cost of the assets and then subtract the first two categories of liabilities, we are left with the asset value of the whole enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defining characteristic of a franchise is that it enables a firm to earn more than it needs to pay for the investments that fund its assets. The intrinsic value of a firm is either the reproduction costs of the assets, which should equal the EPV or those assets plus the competitive advantages of the firm that underlie its franchise. The initial judgment that has to be made is whether the firm currently has a competitive advantage and, if so, how strong and sustainable it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance sheet can provide the following guidance for the investor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shows how much capital is invested in the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it reveals the ease of stringency of the company’s financial condition; i.e., the working-capital structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it provides an important check of the validity of reported earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it supplies the basis for analyzing the sources of income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;computation of book value&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(common stock + surplus items - intangibles) / number of shares outstanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;treatment of preferred stock when calculating book value of common stock&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in calculating the assets available for the common stock, the value of the preferred stock must be subtracted. Graham suggests we value preferred shares at par value plus back-end dividend payments and compare that to the market price. Whatever is highest (or most conservative) should be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;calculation of book value of the preferred stock:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when calculating the book value of a preferred stock issue, it is treated as a common stock, as shown in the equation above, and junior issues are left out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;current asset value and cash asset value&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current asset value of a stock consists of the current assets alone, minus all liabilities and claims ahead of the issue. It excludes not only intangible assets but also fixed and miscellaneous assets (various assets of value not related to the business, such as coin collections and artwork).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cash asset value of a stock consists of the cash assets alone, minus all liabilities and claims ahead of the issue. Other than cash itself, cash assets are defined as those directly equivalent to and held in a place of cash (such as certificates of deposit, and marketable securities at market value).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;practical significance of book value&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the intention was to show the value of the business, but since it is far from reality, the carrying value (the number you can read from the balance sheet) has lost its significance. In most cases, the assets could not be sold at that value, and the earnings do not justify the figure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The practice of writing up the book value of the fixed property or cutting it down to nothing to avoid depreciation charges has made the book value have questionable application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;even though Graham is very skeptical about using book value, he still believes that the book value deserves at least a fleeting glance before buying or selling shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a stock buyer should not know that the value of the stock is entirely related to the business in question, and what he gets from his money will be in tangible resources. A business that sells at a premium does so because it earns a large return compared to its capital. This large return attracts competition; generally speaking, it is not likely to continue indefinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham mentions that companies with high intangibles might be less prone to competition and that small companies, in general, are likely to show a more rapid growth rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham examines the following ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current asset value is generally a rough index of liquidating value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a large number of common stocks sell for less than their current asset value and therefore sell below the amount realizable in liquidation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the phenomenon of many stocks selling persistently below their liquidating value is fundamentally illogical. It means that a severe error is being committed, either: (a) in the judgement of the stock market, (b) in the company’s management policies, or (c) in the stockholders’ attitude toward their property&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;liquidating value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the liquidating value of an enterprise is the money the owners would receive, in theory, if they sold all assets and paid off all debt in the company. They might sell all or part of it to someone else or turn the various assets into cash. Such liquidations are an everyday occurrence in private businesses but not for public companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;realizable value of assets varies with their character&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in reality, a company’s balance sheet does not provide exact information about liquidation value, but it does supply valuable clues and hints. The first rule is that liabilities are real, but the value of the assets must be questioned. All liabilities shown on the books must be deducted at their face amount. The value of the assets, however, must vary according to the character. Cash, for instance, is worth the carrying value, while inventory might only be worth 50-75% compared to the market price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;object of this calculation&lt;/em&gt;: applying a general rule of thumb for a real-life company, it can be seen that the stock was undervalued as it sold for less than the company’s cash holding - even after deducting all liabilities. &lt;strong&gt;The aim of using current asset value as a liquidation measure is not to find the exact liquidation number but to establish a rough estimate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prevalence of stocks selling below liquidating value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at some time in 1932, over 40% of all industrial companies listed on the NYSE were quoted at less than their net current assets. Also, at that time, a considerable number sold for less than their cash asset value. That means that the owner would profit more by shutting the company down than by selling equity on a going concern basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one reason for the very low valuation is the high emphasis on the income statement. A company with no current earnings will be considered highly negative by the stock market. The seller might not know she was disposing of their interest in the company below liquidation value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;local significance of this phenomenon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a common stock sells persistently below its liquidating value, either the price is too low, or the company should be liquidated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 corollaries may be deducted from this principle:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although the low price offers an attractive opportunity to buy, such a price should incite the stockholders to question whether it is in their interest to continue the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such a price should incite the management to take all proper steps to correct the obvious disparity between market quotation and intrinsic value, including a reconsideration of its policies and frank justification to the stockholders of its decision to continue the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a range of potential developments which may result in establishing a higher market price:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the creation of earning power that moves in lock-step with the company’s assets (for instance, from a general improvement in the industry or a change in the company’s operating policies)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;general improvement in the industry&lt;/em&gt;: when the textile business improved, the share of Pepperell increased more than eightfold in just two years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;changes in operating policies&lt;/em&gt;: new lines of products, new sales methods, and reorganizing phases of production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a sale or merger, because some other concern can utilize the resources to better advantage and hence can pay at least liquidating value for the assets.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the white motor company suffered heavy losses and sold at a lower price than the liquidation value. An acquiring company found the big cash holding interesting, and the sales price was based on the current asset value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complete or partial liquidation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;complete liquidation&lt;/em&gt;: The investors of mohawk mining company received 2.5 times the cost of shares when it was decided to liquidate the company altogether. The liquidation value proved identical to the current asset value and could be directly derived from the balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;partial liquidation&lt;/em&gt;: sometimes, an effective higher market value can be created by partially liquidating parts of the business and distributing that wealth out to the shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;discrimination required in selecting such issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no doubt that stocks selling well below their liquidation value provide undervalued securities - and consequently profitable opportunities for purchase. Regardless, the securities analyst should exercise as much discrimination when selecting between the prospects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She can lean toward the five developments above (changes in operating policies, liquidation, etc…) if it is deemed that they may occur. Also, he can look at satisfactory current earnings and dividends or a high average earning power in the past. The analyst will avoid companies that are losing current assets rapidly and showing no sign of fixing the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bargain of this type&lt;/strong&gt;: common stocks that (1) are selling below their liquid asset value, (2) are apparently in no danger of dissipating these assets, and (3) have formerly shown a large earning power on the market price, may be said to belong to a class of investment bargains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;common stock representing the entire business cannot be less safe than a bond having a claim to only a part thereof&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the argument was that the company would have to pay coupon payments to the bond holders, while the dividend payments were unsecure. Here, Wall Street confuses the temporary consistency of income with the safety principle. Dividends paid out to stockholders would not make the stock any safer. What is happening is that the stockholders turn over their property. A rational stock owner would not surrender complete ownership for a limited claim and 5-6% returns on the investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the common purpose of balance sheet analysis is not to find bargain investments but to detect financial weaknesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;working-capital position and debt maturities&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;basic rules concerning working capital:&lt;/strong&gt; for the working-capital ratio, a minimum of $2 of current assets for $1 current liabilities was formerly a standard for industrial companies.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the second measure of financial strength is the “acid test,” which requires that current assets - exclusive of inventories - should be at least equal to the current liabilities. Failing these tests would make the security speculative and higher risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archer-Daniels-Midland company is an exception to the rule. Even though it failed the acid test, this was not a call for concern. While payables increased (lowering both the working-capital ratio and the acid ratio as inventory increased), it represented regular seasoned practice in the industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;large bank debt is frequently a sign of weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is rare that weak financial positions are created only by accounts payable. Weak financial positions are almost always characterized by bank loans or debts due within a short timeframe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the danger of early maturing funded debt&lt;/strong&gt;: when a large bond issue is due soon, it can create serious financial problems, especially when operating results are unfavourable. Maturing funded debt is a frequent cause of insolvency and can be identified from the balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;comparison of balance sheets over a period of time&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a check-up on the reported earnings per share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to determine the effect of losses (or profits) on the company’s financial position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to trace the relationship between the company’s resources and earning power over a long period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;checking the effect of losses or profit on the company’s financial position&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;taking losses on inventories may strengthen financial position&lt;/em&gt;: some losses are represented solely by a decline in the inventory account (which might only be worth 50-75%) of the carrying value)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the shrinkage in the inventory exceeds the losses, leading to an actual increase in cash or reduction in payables, it may be proper to say that the company’s financial position has been strengthened, even though it has been suffering losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;based on liquidation value, the investor in Manhattan Shirt company would have increased the value during the depression due to the company turning assets into cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;profits from inventory inflation&lt;/em&gt;: in the event of high inflation, the inventory will increase in value in terms of accounting.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. Rubber is an example of an increase in earnings, partly made from heavy expenditures on a plant and a dangerous expansion in inventory from 1919-1920, with high inflation. Only looking at the increased reported earnings would the investor not have found this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;long-range study of earning power and resources&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The significance of the foregoing figures&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the United states steel corporation, the effect of WWI is noticeable and has added a hefty sum to the earnings. However, the rate of earnings of investment capital has declined in the last decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this raises the question of whether the end of the war turned the industry into a relatively unprofitable business from a previously relatively prosperous one. It also raises the question of whether it is due to the high reinvestment, which led to overcapacity and, consequently, lower return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the past, a stock-option warrant was attached to a bond or a preferred stock and carried privileges. It was not seen as an independent instrument or an important part of capitalization. Today, opinions are reversed, and it has even become a popular medium for speculators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a (detachable) option warrant is a transferable right to buy stock. The right can be described in detail by the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(1) the kind of stock, (2) the amount, (3) the price, (4) the method of payment, (5) the duration of the privilege, and (6) anti-dilution provisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the type of stock covered by the privilege. Nearly all option warrants can be converted to common stock for the issuing company. Very few have rights that apply to preferred shares. Warrants have no right to receive interest, dividends or payments on account of principal, nor do they have the right to cash any vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resemblance to subscription “right”&lt;/strong&gt;: warrants are in many ways similar to the subscription rights issued by the corporation to stockholders in connection with the sale of additional stock. Differences occur, however, in terms of the exercised price and the period. Subscription rights will typically always be exercised unless the stock price drops substantially, and it will generally happen within the 60 days that the rights typically run. Warrants, on the other hand, are seldom exercised in such a short period, as the stock purchase price is typically set higher than the current stock price at the time of issue. The duration is most often longer than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;method of payment&lt;/strong&gt;. Most option warrants require payment of the subscription price in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;basis of trading in warrants&lt;/strong&gt;: option warrants are bought and sold in the market similarly to common stocks. The standard rule of a warrant is the right to buy one share of the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;examples of warrants issued for various purposes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attached to senior securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as compensation to underwriters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as compensation to promoters and management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issued in a merger or reorganization plan in exchange for other securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attached to an original issue of common stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold separately for cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;warrants as a vehicle of speculation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;qualitative element&lt;/em&gt;: Since a warrant’s value will only materialize from an increase in earnings, the prospects of increased earnings would make the warrant more attractive than its stability, characterized as low-priced common stocks with speculative elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;quantitative considerations: the importance of low price&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham feels that an option warrant has speculative attractiveness only if it possesses all three desirable qualities: low price, long duration, and option price close to the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a substantial part of an enterprise’s profits are distributed to operating managers, which is done without full disclosure. Stock options warrants have proven to be an excellent instrument for that purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dangerous device for diluting stock values.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as warrants give rights to buy the stock at a given price level when that price level is reached, earnings will be diluted for the common stockholder because they still must account for the cost to acquire the warrant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the original issue of common stock carrying warrants to buy additional stock does not give stockholders anything more than they would have without the warrant. Further, it violates an obvious rule of sound corporate financing. A properly managed business sells additional stock only when new capital is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cost of management: 3 items&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buyers of stock at $34 per share were asked to pay for the management in 3 ways:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the $3 difference between the price the investor paid and the company paid. While this money would go to the investment banker as an underwriter’s fee, that premium is paid in the belief that the management was worth the difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The issue of the warrants had taken value away from the common stockholder of one-third of the appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the salaries the officers were to receive plus additional taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the three items together may be said to absorb between 25 and 30% of the amount contributed by the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pyramiding in corporate finance creates a speculative capital structure utilizing a holding company or a series of holding companies. The organizers can control a large business with little or no capital through such construction. Often the intention is to “cash in” speculative profits and, at the same time, retain control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;evils of corporate pyramiding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it results in the creation and sale to investors of large amounts of unsound senior securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the common stock of the governing holding companies is subject to deceptively rapid increases in earning power during favourable years, which can lead to disastrous public speculation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the position of control of someone who owns only a little or no capital is bound to lead to irresponsible and unsound management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it allows for deceiving accounting techniques regarding indicated earnings, dividend return, and book value. This will again lead to speculation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;overstatement of earnings:&lt;/em&gt; holding companies can overstate their earnings power by valuing the stock dividends they receive from subsidiaries at an artificially high price. Earning power can also be overstated using profits made from the sale of stock of subsidiary companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;distortion of dividend return&lt;/em&gt;: stock dividends can be paid out with a market value exceeding current earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;exaggeration of book value&lt;/em&gt;. The exaggeration of book value may occur in cases where a holding company owns most of the shares of a subsidiary, consequently making it possible to manipulate the small amount of stock remaining in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some holding companies not guilty of excessive pyramiding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legitimate reasons for their creation include: permitting unified and economical operations of separate units, diversifying investment and risk, and gaining certain technical advantages of flexibility and convenience. Any holding company should always be considered on its merits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general procedure of the analyst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first method is to conduct a series of comparative analyses of industrial groups along the lines described in the previous chapter. Such studies will give a fair idea of the standard of usual characteristics of that industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the second general method consists of scrutinizing corporate reports. A glance over hundreds of such reports may reveal between five and ten that look interesting enough from the earnings or current asset standpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can cyclical swings of prices be exploited&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one can set up criteria to give an objective opinion of the price level of the stock market, then trade accordingly. While Graham argues the practicality of such a procedure is low and, under the Great Depression, would have made heavy demands upon human fortitude, he still finds the idea appealing. The reason is to look into such a procedure. One is more likely to buy at attractive intrinsic value levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;opportunities in “secondary” or little-known issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;the impermanence of leadership&lt;/em&gt;: the composition of the market leader group varies greatly from year to year, especially because of the recent shift of attention from past performance to assumed prospects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;opportunities in normal markets&lt;/em&gt; during a period when the market generally shows no definite signs of being too low or too high, stocks can still be found cheap on a statistical basis. These stocks generally fall into two classes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those showing high current and average earnings about market price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those making a reasonably satisfactory exhibit of earnings and selling at a low price to the net-current asset value. These companies will most often not be large and well known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the main drawback of a small company is its vulnerability to loss of earning power. Larger companies will be less prone to this. The counterargument is that successful smaller companies can multiply more impressively than those already in enormous size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;market behaviour of standard and nonstandard issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;standard or leading issues almost always respond rapidly to changes in their reported profits - they tend to exaggerate the significance of year-to-year fluctuations in earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the action of less familiar issues depends largely upon the attitude of the professional market operators towards them. If interest in the issue is legitimate and speculative, the price will respond extremely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;relationship of the analyst to such situations&lt;/em&gt; when the general market appears dangerously overvalued to the analyst, he must exercise caution when it comes to unfamiliar common stocks. The same applies when stocks appear to be bargains. A severe decline in the general market will affect all stock prices adversely, and the less familiar issues may prove especially vulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;market exaggerations due to factors other than changes in earnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;dividend changes&lt;/em&gt; while there is no doubt that a dividend increase is a favourable development, a large increase in stock prices based solely on this is absurd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;mergers and segregations&lt;/em&gt;: studies into whether mergers and acquisitions aid in increasing earning power have, in general, indicated that no such effect could be found. Instead, there is reason to believe that the personal element in corporate management often stands in the way of advantageous consolidations. In light of this fact, it is surprising that the stock market tends to react positively to mergers and acquisitions in the short run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;litigation:&lt;/em&gt; a lawsuit of any significance is highly disliked by the stock market, often to the extent that it is out of proportion to the impact of the case in question. Developments of this kind may offer real opportunities to the analyst&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;price-value discrepancies in receivership&lt;/strong&gt;: Graham argues that the analyst can invest in securities after such difficulties have arisen because senior securities have been found to sell at too low prices. Cases of reorganization and other situations where liquidation or sale to outside interest ultimately result in cash distributions that can produce attractive analytical opportunities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;price patterns produced by insolvency&lt;/strong&gt; certain price patterns tend to occur, especially if the receivership takes a long time. First, there is a tendency for the stock issue to sell too high, not only toward the bond issue but also toward their estimated value. For bond issues, the price typically declines over time, reaching the lowest point just before a reorganization plan is ready to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;opportunities in railroad trusteeships&lt;/strong&gt;: in the years following 1932 and the following year, a large part of the country’s railroad mileage fell into the hands of the trustee. This provided shrewd investors with interesting opportunities as it put pressure on the price levels of securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vulnerability of unseasoned issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the earnings power is maintained, the unseasoned issue would maintain the price, but even slight dissatisfactory development will lead to a severe price decline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;unseasoned industrial issues rarely deserve an investment rating&lt;/em&gt;: unseasoned industrial issues should only be bought on an admittedly speculative basis. This requires that the market price be low enough to permit a substantial rise, typically below 70.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;discrepancies in comparative prices&lt;/strong&gt;: it is easier to determine whether issue A is better than issue B than to determine whether issue A in its own right is a good investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham gives two recommendations for selecting an issue to purchase (1) the issue to be bought is attractive in its own right, or (2) there is a definite contractual relationship between the two issues in question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the first recommendation, a qualitative analysis must also be carried out to evaluate the future earning power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;discrepancies due to special supply and demand factors&lt;/strong&gt; can be due to special and temporary factors. As an example, Graham mentions a high-grade railroad issue that became priced relatively differently due to a heavy volume sale of another series&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;united states savings bonds offer similar opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; the disparity between US Government and corporate obligations has reappeared in recent years. In addition to their safety factor, there are also tax advantages, as well as the opportunity to liquidate in the market at any time, with no intermediate loss, due to the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparative-analysis-of-companies-in-the-same-field&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#comparative-analysis-of-companies-in-the-same-field&quot; aria-label=&quot;comparative analysis of companies in the same field permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;comparative analysis of companies in the same field&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one fact that the analyst should be aware of when conducting his analysis is whether or not he is looking at a homogenous industry. Homogenous companies respond similarly to a change in business conditions. In this case, an industry comparison is considered more dependable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it should be remembered, however, that a preferred stock is always less attractive, logically considered, than a common stock making the same showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most recent numbers would require more attention, and secondly, the analyst should aim to learn as much as possible about the underlying reasons for the difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as a general rule, the less homogeneous the industry, the more attention must be paid to the qualitative factors when making comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the analyst must consider qualitative factors and perhaps also allow for the lack of homogeneity. The comparative analysis technique may facilitate his task, but he must still expect to be wrong from time to time. Still, with intelligence and prudence, he should yield better results than the guesses of typical stock buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;observations on the railroad comparison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the average period should be seven years, shorter, or longer is an individual choice. In theory, it should be long enough to cover all cyclical fluctuations but not so long that it includes totally out-of-date data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;numbers to compare/look for:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;capitalization&lt;/strong&gt;: fixed charges, effective debt (fixed charges multiplied by 22), preferred stock at the market (number of shares x market price), common stock at the market, total capitalization, the ratio of effective debt to total capitalization, the ratio of preferred stock to total capitalization, the ratio of common stock to total capitalization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;income account&lt;/strong&gt;: gross revenues, the ratio of maintenance to gross, the ratio of railway operating income (net after taxes) to gross, the ratio of fixed charges to gross, the ratio of balance for common to gross&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;calculations&lt;/strong&gt;: number of times fixed charges earned, I.P. number of times fixed charges plus preferred dividends earned, earned on common stock per share, earned on common stock % of market price, the ratio of gross to the aggregate market value of the common stock, earned on preferred stock, per share, earned on preferred stock, % of market price, the ratio of gross to the aggregate market value of the preferred stock, credit or debit to earnings for undistributed profit or loss of subsidiaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;seven-year average figures&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earned on common stock per share, earned on the common stock, % of the current market price of common, earned on preferred stock per share, earned on preferred stock, % of the current market price of preferred, number of times net deductions earned, number of times fixed charges earned, number of times net deductions plus preferred dividends earned, number of times fixed charges plus preferred dividends earned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dividends&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dividend rate, the yield on common and preferred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trend figure&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earned per share on common stock each year for the past seven years. (Where necessary, earnings should be adjusted to present capitalization)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;public utility comparison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variations in depreciation rates are equally as important as in railroad maintenance ratios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;industrial comparison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 kinds of market analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first kind of market analysis makes predictions exclusively from the past actions of the stock market. (the market is its own best forecaster)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;implication of the first type of market analysis&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;often called technical analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chart-reading cannot be a science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has not proved itself in the past to be a dependable method of making profits in the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its theoretical basis rests upon faulty logic or else upon mere assertion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the other type of mechanical forecasting is based on factors outside the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;disadvantages of market analysis as compared with security analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in market analysis there are no margins of safety; you are either right or wrong and if you are wrong, you lose money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another disadvantage is that profits made by trading in the market are for the most part realized at the expense of others who are trying to do the same thing. The market analyst can therefore be hopeful of success only upon the assumption that he will be more clever or perhaps luckier than his competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prophesies based on near-term prospects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the argument is that if the outlook favours increased earnings, the issue should be bought in the expectation that it will increase in price when the actual profit is reported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham is skeptical of the ability of the analyst to forecast the market behaviour of individual issues over the near-term future. This does not matter if he bases his predictions on the technical position of the market, the general outlook for business, or the specific outlook for individual companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more satisfactory results are to be obtained  by confining the positive conclusions of the security analyst to these fields:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the selection of standard senior issues that meet exacting safety tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the discovery of senior issues that merit an investment rating, but also have opportunities for appreciation in value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the discovery of common stocks or speculative senior issues that appear to be selling at far less than their intrinsic value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the determination of definite price discrepancies between related securities for which situations may justify making exchanges or initiating hedging or arbitrage operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;summary of our views on investment policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;investor of small means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;investment for income&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 1940, United States Savings Bonds have safety and accumulated income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;investment for profit&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 approaches are open to both the small and large investor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purchase of representative common stocks when the market level is clearly low, as judged by objective, long-term standards. This policy requires patience and courage and is by no means free from the possibility of grave miscalculation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purchase of individual issues with special growth possibilities, when these can be obtained at reasonable prices in relation to actual accomplishment. The investor must remember that, when growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purchase of well-secured privileged senior issues. A combination of adequate security with a promising conversion or similar right is rare but possible. A policy of careful selection in this field should bring good results, provided the investor has the patience and persistence needed to find her opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purchase of securities welling well below intrinsic value. Intrinsic value takes into account not only past earnings and liquid asset values but also future earning power, conservatively estimated. In other words, qualitative as well as quantitative elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is logic in the belief that unless a man is qualified to advise others professionally, he should not prescribe for himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;speculation&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buying stock in new or virtually new ventures. The odds are so strongly against him that he might as well throw three-quarters of the money out of the window and keep the rest in the bank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trading in the market: Graham believes that, regardless of preparation and method, success in trading is accidental and temporary, or else due to a highly uncommon talent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purchase of “growth stocks” at generous prices. the chances of individual success are much brighter here than in the other forms of speculation. That said, as it is considered speculation, this approach is still inherently dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The individual investor of large means&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although he has obvious technical advantages over the small investor, he suffers from three specific handicaps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the investor must not only consider United States Savings Bonds, but also the broader field of fixed-value investment. We believe that the strict application of quantitative tests, plus reasonably good judgement in the qualitative area should yield a satisfactory end result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;possible inflation is more serious to him than to the small investor. As stocks to some extent are inflation-proof, they can be held as a defensive measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the size of her investment unit is more likely to induce the large investor to concentrate on popular and active issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;investment by business corporations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it seems fairly evident that other types of investments by business enterprises, be they in bonds or stocks, can offer an appreciably higher return only at the risk of loss and criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;institutional investment&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution that can manage to get along on the low income provided by high-grade, fixed-value issues should confine its holdings to this field. It can be doubted if the better performance of common stock indexes over the past periods will, in itself, warrant the heavy responsibilities and the recurring uncertainties that are inseparable from a common-stock investment program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-relationship-between-owners-and-managers&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-relationship-between-owners-and-managers&quot; aria-label=&quot;the relationship between owners and managers permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Relationship Between Owners and Managers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interests of shareholders and those of management do not always coincide. Most shareholders defer to the wisdom of management without demanding their rights as owners of the business. In the case of companies whose common stocks sell for less than the liquidating value, the shareholders may be best served by the liquidation of the company, but that would put management out of a job, so shareholders cannot depend on management to make the right decision. Investors need to educate themselves about management practices and consider these lessons when investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, however, that “analysis connotes the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions based on established principles and sound logic. It is part of the scientific method. But in applying analysis to the field of securities, [you will] encounter the serious obstacle that investment is by nature, not an exact science.” Still, professional analysis is “not only useful but indispensable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is the stockholders who own the company; the officers are only paid, employees. The directors are elected and virtually trustees whose legal duty is to act solely on behalf of the business owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interests of stockholders and officers conflict at certain points&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in some situations, the management may explicitly have interests in conflict with those of the shareholders
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compensation to officers - salaries, bonuses, options to buy stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expansion of the business - involving the right to larger salaries and the acquisition of more power and prestige by the officers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payment of dividends - should the money earned remain under the control of the management or pass into the hands of the stockholders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuance of the stockholders’ investment in the company - should the business continue as before, although unprofitable, or should part of the capital be withdrawn, or should the business be wound up completely?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;information to stockholders - should those in control be able to benefit through having information not generally given to stockholders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wisdom of continuing the business should be considered&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;management, by definition, is reluctant to return capital to investors, even though the capital might be more useful there. The reason is resource scarcity. For example, to pay the bills when the company has financial problems later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether or not the business should continue is a decision for stockholders, not management. A logical reason to consider this is when the market price is below the liquidation level. After all, that means that the market is wrong or the management is wrong in keeping the enterprise alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;various possible moves for correcting market prices for shares:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if directors are convinced that continuation is preferable to liquidation, the reasons leading to this conclusion should be supplied. A new dividend policy is one solution to maintain the business and limit the risk for investors. The rate should be equivalent to the liquidation value to ensure that stockholders do not suffer due to this decision to keep the business alive. A third option could be to distribute excess cash back to stockholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liquidating an unprofitable business with substantial assets is almost certain to realize more than the existing market price. The reason is earnings govern that market prices; the liquidation process is based on assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;repurchase of share pro rata from shareholders:&lt;/em&gt; if capital is no longer required, it can be advantageous to distribute it back through a share buyback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failure to distinguish one from another has led to tragedies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investments are bonds, outright purchases, permanent holding, for income, in safe securities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speculations are stocks, purchases on margin, for a “quick turn,” for profit, in risky issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specific standards have to be applied to give meaning to the term “safety.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an investment operation promises the safety of the principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an investment operation can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment is founded on the past and present, and speculation relies on the future to improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the investor, the future is to be guarded against rather than profited from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the speculator, anticipates the future will be better than the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“intelligent speculation” is taking a measured risk that seems justified after analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“unintelligent speculation” is taking a risk without adequate examination of the situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safety is measured in terms of the ability of the issuer to meet obligations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that ability should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high dividends do not compensate lack of safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding trouble is better than seeking protection after it occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a sound investment must be able to withstand adversity. Investors may favour enterprises that have withstood adversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment for profit, where growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the investor of small means may opt to step out of his role and become a speculator. He may also opt to regret his actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term analysis indicates a scientific and systematic study of facts, which results in logical conclusions. But investment is not an exact science, and success derives partly from personal skills and chance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;there are three variables used to rank stocks: fundamental, growth, and profitability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the most common variables used to select stocks are those that relate the price of the shares to some essential company information: share price to earnings, share price to cash flow, share price to book value, share price to sales, or share price to dividends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is very little altruism in finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The typical American stockholder is the most docile and apathetic animal in captivity. He never thinks of asserting his individual rights as owner of the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Modern financing methods are not that far different from a magician’s bag of tricks; they can be executed in full view of the public without it being very much the wiser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You cannot make a quantitative deduction to allow for an unscrupulous management; the only way to deal with such situations is to avoid them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Undervalued investment issues may be discovered in any period by means of assiduous search.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The investor cannot safely judge the merits or demerits of a security by his personal reaction to the kind of business in which it is engaged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An institution with securities of its own to sell cannot be looked to for entirely impartial guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Needless to say, an investor is never forced to buy a security of inferior grade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An investment in the soundest type of enterprise may be made on unsound and unfavorable terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Safety does not reside in titles, or forms, or legal rights, but in the values behind the security issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that no good bonds are available is hardly an excuse for either issuing or accepting poor ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever benefits a business benefits its owners, provided the benefit is not conferred upon the corporation at the expense of the stockholders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very frequently, the market’s appraisals are based on mob psychology, on faulty reasoning and on the most superficial examination of inadequate information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;quantitative data is useful only to the extent that’s supported by a qualitative survey of the enterprise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the stock market is a voting machine rather than a weighing machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham taught that intrinsic value can not be boiled down to a precise number. Nor was precision needed to make money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham set up the Ben Graham Joint Account in 1926. His fee was structured as 20% of the first 20% return, 30% of the next 30% return, and 50% of the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He ran an arbitrage strategy with convertible preferreds in the 1920s. He was long the preferreds and short the common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He lost 20% in 1929, after selling his shorts while holding the long positions in preferreds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believing the worst was over, Graham went all-in on value and lost 50% in 1930 (he used margin). In total, he lost 70% from 1929 to 1932!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Livermore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing rules of thumb offer simple shortcuts for investors but they hide the complex nature of markets. The rules work most of the time, but not always. The risk is that the rules become blinders to what’s going on in markets, which then leads to bad decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Livermore made and lost a fortune multiple times over. The lessons Livermore never learned: 1) by constantly trading (with leverage), you’re bound to go broke and 2) there are risks to never being satisfied with a ridiculous amount of money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40% of stocks since 1980 experienced a 70% decline and never recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twain had a bad habit of sinking money into horrible investments. He speculated on other people’s new business ventures, his own ventures, the stock market, and rather than get out, he doubled down on the losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A venture in the publishing business bankrupted him. He eventually repaid all his debts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid Twain-sized losses, investors should ask themselves how much they’re willing to lose before they invest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Meriwether&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans have a tendency to believe they’re above average — above-average drivers, above average at our jobs, above-average investors… We can’t all be above average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meriwether founded Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1994 with Robert Merton and Myron Scholes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LTCM earned 20% in 1994, 43% in 1995, and 41% in 1996. In 1997, Merton and Scholes won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LTCM ran an arbitrage strategy with a ton of leverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LTCM lost 6.7% in May 1998 as spreads between US and international bonds widened. Then they lost 10% in June. The collapse of the Russian stock market spiked short-term rates in August. LTCM was down 52% YTD, a $1.9 billion loss. From Sept. 10 to 21 they lost another $1.5 billion. The New York Fed forced a takeover of the fund before it infected the financial system. It was the largest hedge fund at the time at $3.6 billion, 40% was Meriweather, Merton, and Scholes personal wealth…wiped out in five weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their mistake was believing markets were rational and certain that math could solve it. They failed to acknowledge that the behavior of millions of participants around the globe might impact markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Bogle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bogle was promoted in 1965 to run the Wellington Group. The flagship Wellington Fund was a balanced fund created in 1928. As the Wellington fund began to lag the markets during the Go-Go ’60s, Bogle merged Wellington with Ivest, a young firm of “new era” managers, in an attempt to keep up with the times. Wellington fund would lose 40% when the Go-Go ’60s market crashed in 1969.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bogle was fired in 1974. With nothing to lose, he proposed he stay on as chairman of the Wellington Fund. His failure would lead to the creation of the Vanguard Group and the First Index Investment Trust — i.e. the index fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Steinhardt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Styles go out of favor. Portfolios hit hard times. Straying outside your comfort zone for opportunities during these difficult periods can make things worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steinhardt’s hedge fund earned a 24.5% annual return after fees from 1967 to 1995.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hedge funds were so popular in 1990s, people were begging hedge funds to take their money. Steinhardt used the opportunity to open a fourth fund — Steinhardt Overseas Fund — in 1993. Except, he had no knowledge of foreign markets, business environment, or political systems. He believed his experience trading U.S. stocks would translate over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Fed raised rates in February 1994, pushed U.S. bond prices lower but European bonds fell further. Steinhardt’s fund lost $800 million with the rate hike. He lost 29% on the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Tsai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors tend to associate gains with skill rather than bull market luck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bull markets drive investors to trade more because rising markets provide a positive feedback loop to investors. Investors trade stocks, make a little money, trade more, make more, and the trading increases…until the bull market ends. Then it blows up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The late 1960s bull market culminated with the Go-Go fund managers. Jerry Tsai was at the center of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He started the Manhattan fund in 1965, raising more money than initially planned. It had an 8.5% sales load. Tsai bought any stock that rose faster than the market. The strategy works great in ’67 earning a 40% return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tsai learned that high-flying stocks can fall faster than they rise. The market crashed in 1969. The Manhattan Fund lost 90% over the next few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endowment Effect: we put more value on things we own than before we bought them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett made numerous mistakes over his long career, but none like Dexter Shoes. He paid $433 million for Dexter using Berkshire stock. He diluted shareholders to buy a business that was worth nothing a few years later. It couldn’t compete with foreign competitors. His Dextor purchase was likely due to overconfidence thanks to his successful purchase of another shoe company — H.H. Brown — a few years early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Ackman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We prefer to talk more about our successes than our failures — especially for investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ackman’s battle with Herbalife began in 2012 with a very public presentation claiming it was a pyramid scheme that would go to zero. He was short Herbalife and the stock immediately sold off 35%. Which provided an opportunity for hedge funds to take the other side. The stock reversed course, rising 70% higher than where Ackman began to short it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk of being public about investments is it brings ego into decision-making. Can you publicly admit to being wrong? There’s also the added pressure from others who are following your coat tails (without doing their own research) and it feeds the trolls when it doesn’t work out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanley Druckenmiller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Druckenmiller bet against Internet stocks in 1999 that cost him $600 million, an 18% loss. He ended the year positive 35% thanks to a couple of new hires who took the long side of the Internet Boom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2000 he sold the Internet stocks out of concern — he knew it wouldn’t last forever — took his gains, and went back to investing in what he was comfortable with. Yet, he couldn’t help but watch the Internet stocks continue rising and his two new hires making money, until he couldn’t stand it and plunged back in. He bought back in at the height of the bubble, then it burst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His mistake was knowing better and buying the stocks anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Ruane — Sequoia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk of concentrated portfolios is a few big losses can set you back permanently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequoia was one of the most successful funds ever. It bought Valient stock in 2010 and it quickly became its largest holding. Valient relied on buying existing drug companies, then raising the price of the drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accusations of fraud at Valient surfaced in 2015. Its stock fell 19%. Sequoia lost 9% because of its large position. Then it bought more Valient stock. It represented 32% of the fund. 8 months later, they sold all the stock. Valient was down more than 90%!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before buying a position, write down why you’re buying and your exit plan. It gives you a reference point that may help combat the endowment effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Maynard Keynes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynes’s initial foray into “investing” was trading currencies and commodities based on macro bets after WWI. It didn’t end well. He lost it all and was bailed out by family and friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He shifted his strategy to a more long-term approach after taking over the King’s College endowment fund and the portfolios of two insurance companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Paulson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paulson is most well known for betting against mortgage-backed securities during the housing bubble. It paid off massively — 590% and 350% — in one year for two funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Off the back of that success, he went looking for another huge win. He settled on a big bet on gold. It failed to pay off. In fact, it lost money three years in a row — 75% in total. Because normal returns weren’t good enough!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trouble with abnormal gains like Paulson had, is it resets our expectations of what’s possible. Normal gains aren’t enough anymore. The other issue is overconfidence in our ability to repeat the success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger started his fund in 1962, earning a 24% annual return before fees over 14 years (vs. S&amp;#x26;P 500’s 5.2%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fund was highly concentrated. It brings the possibility of a wider range of returns in both directions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His investors felt the downside of concentration in the 1973/74 bear market. Munger lost 32% and 31% over those two years versus the Dows 13% and 23% losses respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people don’t have the stomach for such a huge drawdown. He lost a big investor because of it. The fund bounced back in 1975, then Munger liquidated it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Losses and drawdowns are part of the game. Get used to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You need patience, discipline, and an ability to take losses without going crazy.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best lesson investors can learn from one of the best to ever do it is that there are no good times without the bad times. Big losses are in the fabric of long‐term investing. And if you’re not willing to accept them, you will not harvest the long‐term returns that the market has to offer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50 percent or more two or three times a century, you’re not fit to be a common shareholder and you deserve the mediocre result you’re going to get compared to the people who do have the temperament, who can be more philosophical about these market fluctuations.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You only need to get rich once. If you’ve worked hard or just got lucky and now find yourself in the top 1%, stop trying to hit home runs, you’ve already won.”
Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Money earned by luck is indistinguishable from money earned by skill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea of wholesale shifts is for various reasons impracticable and indeed undesirable. Most of those who attempt it sell too late and buy too late, and do both too often…. I believe now that successful investment depends upon three principles: A careful selection of few investments having regard to their cheapness in relation to their probable actual and potential intrinsic value over a period of years ahead and in relation to alternative investments at the time. A steadfast holding of these in fairly large units through thick and thin, perhaps for several years, until they have fulfilled their promise or it is evident that they were purchased on a mistake; A balanced investment position, i/e, a variety of risks in spite of individual holdings being large, and if possible opposed risks.” — John Maynard Keynes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How could economics not be behavioral? If it isn’t behavioral, what the hell is it?” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every minute of every day, markets are putting out clues, little crumbs of information for would‐be market detectives. This is the most addictive game on the planet because it’s a game that never ends. The pieces are always zigging and zagging and by the time you think you’ve got things figured out, new rules are implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Professional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs…each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors… We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.” — John Maynard Keynes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we speak frankly, we have to admit that our basis of knowledge for estimating the yield ten years hence of a railway, a copper mine, a textile factory, the goodwill of a patent medicine, an Atlantic liner, a building in the City of London amounts to little and sometimes to nothing; or even five years hence.” — John Maynard Keynes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want to make big money in the stock market, you have two choices: (1) buy a lot of stocks, an index fund, for example, and hold them for a long time (even then, no guarantees) or (2) buy a few stocks and hope you’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re looking for a manager you want someone who is intelligent, energetic, and moral. But if they don’t have the last one, you don’t want them to have the first two.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your six best ideas in life will do better than all your other ones.” — Bill Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Concentrate to get rich, diversify to stay rich.” — old adage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea of caring that someone is making money faster is one of the deadly sins. Envy is a really stupid sin because it’s the only one you could never possibly have any fun at. There’s a lot of pain and no fun. Why would you want to get on that trolley?” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I bought $6 billion worth of tech stocks, and in six weeks I had lost $3 billion in that one play. You asked me what I learned. I didn’t learn anything. I already knew that I wasn’t supposed to do that. I was just an emotional basket case and couldn’t help myself. So maybe I learned not to do it again, but I already knew that.” — Stanley Druckenmiller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would have been nice to go out on top, like Michael Jordan, but I overplayed my hand.” — Stanley Druckenmiller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a winner’s game the outcome is determined by the correct actions of the winner. In a loser’s game, the outcome is determined by mistakes made by the loser.” — Charley Ellis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bad things tend to happen when we compare our portfolios with others, especially if they possess a lesser IQ and extracted a higher return.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fundamentals are how fast the horse runs and expectations are the odds.” — Michael Mauboussin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The casual investor thinks a good company makes for a good stock, without giving consideration to the fact that the majority of investors share a similar opinion. Perhaps, like‐minded investors have pushed the price of a good company into that of a great company, making it less than it appears at first blush.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s my philosophy, which has been reinforced by Mr. Soros, that when you earn the right to be aggressive, you should be aggressive. The years that you start off with a large gain are the times that you should go for it.” — Stanley Druckenmiller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first thing I heard when I got in the business, not from my mentor, was bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered. I’m here to tell you I was a pig. And I strongly believe the only way to make long‐term returns in our business that are superior is by being a pig.” — Stanley Druckenmiller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ideas are part of who we are. They become like possessions. Especially publicly. I mean, flip-flopping is a bad word. I love changing my mind!” — Daniel Kahneman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I clearly made a mistake in paying what I did for Dexter in 1993. Furthermore, I compounded that mistake in a huge way by using Berkshire shares in payment.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It behooves us to take a minute and think about why we’re investing and what we really know. Do you know more than the person on the other side of the trade? Do you know something that’s not in the newspaper or on the Internet? Will we know when we’re right? What about if we’re wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the game is no longer being played your way, it is only human to say the new approach is all wrong, bound to lead to trouble, etc. I have been scornful of such behavior by others in the past. I have also seen the penalties incurred by those who evaluate conditions as they were – not as they are. Essentially I am out of step with present conditions. On one point, however, I am clear. I will not abandon a previous approach whose logic I understand even though it may mean foregoing large, and apparently easy, profits to embrace an approach which I don’t fully understand, have not practiced successfully and which, possibly, could lead to a substantial permanent loss of capital.” — Warren Buffett, 1967&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Genius is a rising market.” — John Kenneth Galbraith&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“1987 had shaken me; 1994 had been devastating. It had taken a part of me that could not be retrieved.” — Michael Steinhardt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Putting too much money into something you don’t fully understand is a good way to lose a lot of money. But what’s more damaging than losing money is the psychological scar tissue that remains after the money vanishes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bad behavior is one of the greatest dangers investors face, and traveling outside your circle of competence is one of the most common ways that investors misbehave. It’s not important how wide your circle of competence is, but what is critically important is that you stay inside it. Knowing what you don’t know and having a little discipline can make all the difference in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors who confine themselves to what they know, as difficult as that may be, have a considerable advantage over everyone else.” — Seth Klarman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The important part is finding a methodology that you are comfortable with. But a methodology means something that is repeatable. It means having a process. The stock market throws far too many curveballs for you to wing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first five years you would have described Bogle as a genius. And at the end of the first 10 years, roughly, you would have said: the worst merger in history, including AOL and Time Warner. It all fell apart. Their management skills were zero. They ruined the fund they started, Ivest. They started two more and ruined both. And they ruined Wellington Fund.” — Jack Bogle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can hardly find words to describe first my regret and then my anger at myself for having made so many bad choices. Associating myself – and the firm whose leadership I had been entrusted – with a group of go‐go managers.” — Jack Bogle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The lesson we can learn from one of the most influential investors of all time is that investing is a long journey, often lasting a lifetime. It is filled with success, failure, hopes, dreams, and everything in‐between.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were able to calculate the odds of everything, but they understood the possibility of nothing. The lesson us mere mortals can learn from this seminal blowup is obvious: Intelligence combined with overconfidence is a dangerous recipe when it comes to the markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They made absolutely no allowance in the episode of LTCM for the possibility of their not understanding markets and their methods being wrong.” — Nassim Taleb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They believed the risk was low, but their leverage in both the United States and Europe soared. LTCM had about $40 million at stake for every point in volatility the markets moved. At one point, they had $1.25 trillion in open positions and they were levered 100:1. This leverage would lead to one of the largest disappearing acts of wealth the world has ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…markets don’t compensate you just for being smart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The iron rule of life is that only 20% of people can be in the top fifth.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are two times in a man’s life when he should not speculate, when he can’t afford it, and when he can.” — Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining and wants it back the minute it begins to rain.” – Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is strange the way the ignorant and inexperienced so often and so undeservedly succeed when the informed and the experienced fail.” — Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.” — Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing when speculating is that you keep your losses manageable. Paper cuts sting, but they heal. Shotgun wounds on the other hand, those are tough to come back from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got drubbed by the 1973 to 1974 crash, not in terms of true underlying value, but by quoted market value, as our publicly traded securities had to be marked down to below half of what they were really worth.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem with small losses is that it’s easy to hold onto them as they morph into big losses. In the world of finance, nothing springs eternal like hope. We’ll watch with indifference as a 5% loss becomes a 10% loss, with fear as it cascades to a 20% loss, and with utter terror as it falls any further.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that he remained steadfast in his conviction that security analysis was a worthwhile endeavor is nothing short of remarkable. The partnership earned 6% a year from 1926 to 1935, compared to…3.8% for the Dow. Despite the hard times and enormous drawdown, Graham would continue to operate under the assumption that value investing is the most intelligent way to achieve superior results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately in this kind of work, where you are trying to determine relationships based upon past behavior, the almost invariable experience is that by the time you have had a long enough period to give you sufficient confidence in your form of measurement just then new conditions supersede and the measurement is no longer dependable in the future.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I must say frankly our studies indicate you have your choice of tossing coins and taking the consensus of expert opinion, and the results are just about the same in each case… Everybody in Wall Street is so smart that their brilliance offsets each other. And that whatever they know is already reflected in the level of stock prices pretty much and consequently what happens in the future represents what they don’t know.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s critically important to be aware of value, but it’s more important not to be a slave to it. Graham taught us that there are no iron‐clad laws in finance and that cheap can get cheaper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I wasn’t in it – or it went way down and I was completely in it. My intention was to minimize my future regret.” — Harry Markowitz on his asset allocation decision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my nearly fifty years of experience in Wall Street I’ve found that I know less and less about what the stock market is going to do but I know more and more about what investors ought to do; and that’s a pretty vital change in attitude.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important lesson that investors should take from the person who taught us the difference between value and price is that value investing is not a panacea. Cheap can get cheaper. Rich can get richer. Margins of safety can be miscalculated, and value can fail to materialize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You will do a great disservice to yourselves, to your clients, and to your businesses, if you view behavioral finance mainly as a window onto the world. In truth, it is also a mirror that you must hold up to yourselves.” — Jason Zweig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you are ready to give up everything else and study the whole history and background of the market and all principal companies whose stocks are on the board as carefully as a medical student studies anatomy‐ if you can do all that and in addition you have the cool nerves of a gambler, the sixth sense of a clairvoyant and the courage of a lion, you have a ghost of a chance.” — Bernard Baruch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mistakes are an inevitable part of the process.” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The lesson that investors should learn from Livermore is how dangerous rules of thumb can be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems incredible that knowing the game as well as I did, and with an experience of twelve or fourteen years of speculating in stocks and commodities, I did precisely the wrong thing.” — Jess Livermore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I kept trading – and losing. I persisted in thinking that the stock market must make money for me in the end. But the only end in sight was the end of my resources.” — Jesse Livermore, 1909&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a man is both wise and lucky, he will not make the same mistake twice. But he will make any one of the ten thousand brothers or cousins of the original. The mistake family is so large that there is always one of them around when you want to see what you can do in the fool‐play line.” — Jesse Livermore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trusted place I can easily find and look at to see additional/support information on any projects that are working on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a reliable place for ideas and tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain perspective and trust in the focus and the priorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting in-tray(s) to zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid open loops and cognitive loads in mind to remember the open loops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reference system to retrieve information within 30 seconds or less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to access the visualization of the tasks in the inbox/today/next action lists, so it’s easier for you to take action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair this with &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/&quot;&gt;Tiago Forte’s PARA system&lt;/a&gt;, start using &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/&quot;&gt;progressive summarization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 key objectives:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture all the things to get done, or that have usefulness for you, outside your head (and therefore off your mind).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide about what “inputs” you allow into your life, which dictate your list of “next actions”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to curate and coordinate all that content, so you can access it at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key ingredients in relaxed control are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(1) clearly defined outcomes (projects) and the next actions required to move them toward closure, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(2) reminders placed in a trusted system that is reviewed regularly. This is what I call horizontal focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for Zapier and build one very simple automation. It doesn’t matter which one. Maybe create some kind of reminder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for Todoist and start just putting tasks into the Inbox. Maybe create a few Projects. Install it on your phone. Practise using it to get things out of your head for a couple of weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you decide after a few weeks that you don’t hate Todoist, spend one afternoon/evening doing the Core Dump, where you just create Projects and add Tasks until everything seems out of your head. It is probably not that important to have links from Todoist tasks back to specific emails as long as you know what to search for in Gmail when needed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it easy to extract the information out of the brains
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it usually takes less than 30 seconds to create the todo item on the phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;index cards can be used to write down ideas, but the items on index cards need to be transferred to Todoist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apply a label to an email, which then is picked up by Zapier action and creates a card in Trello with the text of the email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the Todoist Gmail plugin to create a task and put it in the in-tray
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://todoist.com/help/articles/use-gmail-with-todoist&quot;&gt;Use Gmail with Todoist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is probably not that important to have links from Todoist tasks back to specific emails as long as you know what to search for in Gmail when you need it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there’s an inbox item and There’s no project fit for it, it should be deleted forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a todo item from a voice command

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“OK, Google, Ask Todoist to add a task. Wash the car today.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Siri Action
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios&quot;&gt;Shortcut Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell the action’s title to Siri, and it prompts the card’s title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inbox/Task List: a combination of Todoist and 1-5 index cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;core Dump where you just create Projects and add Tasks until everything seems out of your head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/remind-yourself-to-schedule-x&quot;&gt;Remind Yourself To Schedule A Thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you choose not to document something in your inbox
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what does that choice feel like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when this happens, what do you do instead? (Keep it in your brain’s memory? Write it on a piece of paper. Something else?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why did you choose not to do the task?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forgot to think about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thought about it but never felt like I could schedule it because I had other things to do that I consciously decided were more urgent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thought about it and consciously decided, “I’ll do it later,” but then I forgot to think about it a second time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thought about it and consciously decided, “I can’t justify taking time from my schedule to do this now,” but then I forgot to think about it a second time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some other reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after deciding the reason(s) not to do the task
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move the item from your inbox into a new Project. Let this project have only one task: do it! Move this new Project up your list of Projects until everything above it is more urgent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a new recurring task called “Decide when to do (the original task).” Remind yourself once per week. If you notice that you never even decide when to do the original task, then the original task wasn’t important enough or urgent enough. &lt;strong&gt;Throw it away, and maybe it comes back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick an exact time to do the task, and then put that on your calendar. At the moment that time arrives, either you do the task, or you throw it away (and maybe one day it comes back)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need somewhere to put everything (physical tray, digital tool, etc.).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize the number of capture locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty the capture tools regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be clear about what is required and how it will get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it actionable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s the next action?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do it, delegate it, or defer it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-minute rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the next action can be done in 2 minutes or less, do it now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make sure things are where you expect them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-action items: trash, incubation, reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For action items, add a calendar and a list of reminders to the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 primary types of things to keep track of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Projects list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projects: any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should have an index of projects where you capture relevant information and tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For actions: they should go on a Next Actions list (not your calendar!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep a Single list of all current projects&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add a project to the Todoist projects list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project support material&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calendar actions and information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to keep the calendar as the most trusted part of the todo system, use it to record the following kinds of information
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time-specific actions: i.e. appointments, reserved time for a certain activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;day-specific actions: i.e. a shipment must be sent today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;day-specific information: i.e. daughter’s birthday, office moves, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Actions lists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apply the Todoist label next action on the task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make sure each project has at least one task with a next-action label&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can’t even guess the effort of a smaller next action, then maybe the next action is “Spend 30 minutes figuring out what it means to complete this project”. Maybe the lack of vision/clarity about the “acceptance criteria” makes it hard for you to know where to start.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe one next action which you can guess how long it will take—even if that next action is tiny or seems insignificant. That means moving the item from Inbox to New Project, then writing two tasks for that project:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the new, smaller next action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;figure out how to do the rest of this project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Waiting For list&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apply the Todoist label wait-for for the specific task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference material&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store and access (reference material easily when needed, whether it is paper or digital)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reference: a combination of Standard Notes and one Git repository (Or Google Drive), which I back up on Gitlab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coming up with keywords with: “How am I likely to search for this six months from now.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Drive folder name general-reference. Organized by keywords like general-reference/meme. Each folder is mapped to a keyword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tags note appropriately so it can be found later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Someday/Maybe list&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Someday/Maybe as a project in todoist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get in-tray(s) (paper or digital) to empty every day or so&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Is the Weekly Review?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very simply, the Weekly Review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again and get oriented for the next couple of weeks. It’s going through the steps of workflow management—capturing, clarifying, organizing, and reviewing all your outstanding commitments, intentions, and inclinations—until you can honestly say, “I know right now everything I’m not doing but could be doing if I decided to.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a practical standpoint, here is the three-part drill that can get you there: get clear, get current, and get creative.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting clear will ensure that all your collected stuff is processed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting current will ensure that all your orienting “maps” or lists are reviewed and up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The creative part happens to some degree automatically. As you get clear and current—you will naturally generate ideas and perspectives that add value to your thinking about work and life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use project template GTD Weekly review from Todoist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Right Time and Place for the Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I recommend you block out two hours (too long, maybe 30 minutes?) early in the afternoon of your last workday for the review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Bigger Picture” Reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, at some point, you must clarify the larger outcomes, the long-term goals, the visions and principles that ultimately drive, test, and prioritize your decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your key goals and objectives in your work? What should you have in place a year or three years from now? How is your career going? Is this the lifestyle that is most fulfilling to you? Are you doing what you want or need to do from a deeper and longer-term perspective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;regularly review the professional and personal todo list&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;daily review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use embedded widgets from Todoist on phone/browser, so the tasks in inbox/next action/today can easily be viewed and acted on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;identify and address your limiting criteria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;context, time available, the energy available (tackle frog labels with the highest energy), and priority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recommended at least 60-90 minutes daily, but I often only have 5 mins to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tasks that are hard to classify&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I just want to remember to have the option to do this task, but I’m OK if it waits five years.” Put it in Someday/Maybe or create a new project for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I just need to decide whether to do it or not.” Set a reminder for “Decide when to do X,” or just put the damn thing on your calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe, just &lt;strong&gt;delete it, and it will come back if it is significant enough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolve the possible guilt about it. Put it out of your mind. You can do it either by deciding “I’m going to do it on a Specific date” or “I’m going just to put it in the list, and I’m happy if I do it next week, next month, next year, or next decade.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when reviewing the inbox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use Projects aggressively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if there are no projects fit for an item, delete it forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;engage&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#engage&quot; aria-label=&quot;engage permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Engage:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One model is to choose based on: context, time available, energy available, and priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Your Work
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The six levels of work may be thought of in terms of altitude, as in the floors of a building:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon 5: Life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon 4: Long-term visions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon 3: One- to two-year goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon 1: Current projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground: Current actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s recommended that you start at the Ground, complete your action lists, and work your way up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to set up systems and tricks that get you to think about your projects and situations more frequently, easily, and in depth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two types of projects, however, that deserve at least some sort of planning activity: (1) those that still have your attention even after you’ve determined their next actions and (2) those about which potentially useful ideas and supportive detail just show up ad hoc.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first type—the projects you know have other things that must be decided on and organized—will need a more detailed approach than just identifying the next action. For these, you’ll need a more specific application of one or more of the other four phases of the natural planning model: purpose and principles, vision/outcome, brainstorming, and/or organizing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second type—the projects for which ideas just show up, ad hoc, when you’re on a beach or in a car or at a meeting—need to have an appropriate place to capture these associated ideas. Then they can reside there for later use as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools matter for supporting project thinking. Some tips:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you always have a method of capturing ideas and information on hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep good writing tools around all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have whiteboards around where you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of the Capturing Habit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people with whom you interact notice that without fail, you receive, process, and organize in an airtight manner the exchanges and agreements they have with you, they begin to trust you uniquely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More significantly, you incorporate self-confidence in your engagement with your world that money cannot buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It noticeably enhances your mental well-being and improves the quality of your communications and relationships, both personally and professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Much Capturing is Required?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When will you know how much you have left in your head to capture? Only when there’s nothing left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the only thing on your mind is the only thing on your mind, you’ll be “present,” in your “zone,” with no distinction between work and play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This doesn’t mean that your mind will be empty. If you’re conscious, your mind will always be focusing on something. But if it’s focusing on only one thing at a time, without distraction, you’ll be in your “zone.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suggest you use your mind to think about things rather than think of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a culture adopts “What’s the next action?” as a standard operating query, there’s an automatic increase in energy, productivity, clarity, and focus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Three Tiers of Mastery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 | Employing the fundamentals of managing workflow;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 | Implementing a more elevated and integrated total life management system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 | Leveraging skills to create clear space and get things done for an ever-expansive expression and manifestation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering the Basics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other basic practices, which, even if implemented initially, easily regress into incomplete, out-of-date, and therefore dysfunctional usage, include:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding next-action decision-making on “stuff to do.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully utilizing the “Waiting For” category, such that every expected deliverable from others is inventoried and reviewed for follow-up in adequate timing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Agenda lists to capture and manage communications with others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping a simple, easily accessible filing and reference system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping the calendar a pure “hard landscape” without undermining its trustworthiness with extraneous inputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing Weekly Reviews to keep one’s system functional and current&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graduate Level–Integrated Life Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a complete, current, and clear inventory of projects;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a working map of one’s roles, accountabilities, and interests—personally and professionally;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an integrated total life management system, custom tailored to one’s current needs and direction and utilized to dynamically steer out beyond the day-to-day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;challenges and surprises trigger your utilization of this methodology instead of throwing you out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s on your mind, your mind isn’t clear. Anything unfinished must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small, manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.”—Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are only two problems in life:
(1) you know what you want, and you don’t know how to get it; and/or
(2) you don’t know what you want.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have you learned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s a refactoring to pattern exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take this opportunity to review into domain/refactoring to patterns and Arlo commits -&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jay.bazuzi.com/why-acn/&quot;&gt;https://jay.bazuzi.com/why-acn/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy I followed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stumble upon the pyramid of refactoring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/course/pyramid-of-refactoring-java-interpreter-factories/learn/lecture/17510056#overview&quot;&gt;refactor pyramid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emilybache/Necklace-Refactoring-Kata&quot;&gt;https://github.com/emilybache/Necklace-Refactoring-Kata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it turns out that it has a very good examples to illustrate the introduction indirect layer, so I have added a new example to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonytvo/introduce-indirection-layer/tree/main/pyramid-refactor-example&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tonytvo/introduce-indirection-layer/tree/main/pyramid-refactor-example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn’t realize it such a foundational patterns that allow other patterns/flow in the system to emerge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it seems like for this exercise I would lean more using these examples to update introduction to indirect layer kata, so it can be used to practice refactoring to patterns as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attempt the chain of responsibility refactoring from wlodekkr here -&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonytvo/chain-of-responsibility/pull/1&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tonytvo/chain-of-responsibility/pull/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once I finish with updating the introduction indirect layer, I will try to finish this kata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;options are about the trading - the buying and selling of risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the objective is to generate high yield income from writing/selling puts and do so while minimizing risk as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning to identify the important factors in a trade and then lining up those factors as much as possible on your side, leads to clarity - you suddenly “get” why some traders are really successful and why others struggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;adopt probabilistic mindset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep diary of your trades

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 minutes rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s best to limit yourself to 1 or 2 positions, that is, options that have not yet been sold or used - at a time. Otherwise, it’s easy to lose track of how many open positions are in play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checking the expiration date and the strike price. All of this information is located in the options chain. Many traders get into trouble here: if you enter 100 call contracts when you only meant ten or one, you have a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check the bid-ask price, which is the highest price a buyer will pay and the lowest price a seller will accept. If the bid ask spread is too wide - meaning there’s too large a gap between the two - find another stock to trade. It’s too difficult to make a profitable trade if the bid and ask prices are too distant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make sure you place a limit order and not a market order. It’s very risky to buy stocks at market price. Instead, a limit order lets you name your price, which should be somewhere between the bid and ask prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;review the stock charts one last time to confirm that your initial observations still hold true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can always take 5 minutes - especially when it will keep you from rushing into a problematic trade because of a careless mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;covered call&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for each 100 shares that a trader owns of an optionable stock, the trader can write (or sell) one call option (sell to open) against those shares in exchange for a cash premium payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the stock closes at expiration above the strike price, the call will be exercised and the trader will be required to sell his or her underlying shares to the holder of the call at the agreed upon strike price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the stock closes at expiration AT or BELOW the strike price, the call will expire worthless, the trader retains the shares, and is free to write a new covered call if and when he or she chooses to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the covered call writer may also buy back the call at any time prior to expiration (buy to close) for either a profit or a loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rolling covered calls: buy back expiring calls and sell new call with later expiration
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rolling out: rolling to later expiration and the SAME strike price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rolling out and up: rolling to later expiration and to a higher strike price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;benefits: not losing money on the roll, increases the strike price, and captures more of the cap gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drawbacks: requires longer rolls and smaller credits. Would not works when there’s big pops in stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;naked puts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy $40 put on a $45 stock, no matter how low the stock trades, you will be able to sell @ $40&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a put writer becomes the insurance company. He or she collects the premium in exchange for assuming the responsibility of purchasing the shares should the shares be below the strike price when the put expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cash secured puts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strategy: writing short-dated, at the money, cash-secured puts on high quality companies when they’re trading at fundamentally and technically attractive prices.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fairly close to expiration date (20-45 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time value component of option is highest at the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully backed with cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the biggest risk is when there’s big move lower
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;could be minimized in the trade setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what does it mean to be high-quality?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;might need to wait for the stock to be fundamentally sound or technically attractive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bull spread credit spread&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ratio call spread&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What determine the price of an option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intrinsic value: difference between the underlying price and strike price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time value
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volatility (expected/implied)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;general market conditions or mood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company-specific history &amp;#x26; events: earnings, legal/regulatory/other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time until expiration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dividends and dividend cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interest rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;option greeks:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delta: sensitivity to price change in the underlying security.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impacted by:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the strike price and share price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time remaining until expiration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the deeper in the money, the higher the delta. Inverse, the father out of the money, the lower delta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as back door predicting mechanism
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not very accurate (esp. longer dated)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delta 0.5 = 50-50 chance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delta 0.9 = strong likelihood to be in the money (ITM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the farther away expiration is, the deeper in the money you need to generate high delta. A lot can happen to share price in long time period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gamma: sensitivity of delta to price change in the underlying security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theta: sensitivity to time. The amount of daily time decay in the price of option assuming nothing else changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vega: sensitivity to volatility changes. The amount of change to the option for each percentage unit change in the underlying security’s volatility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rho: sensitivity to interest rates. The amount of change to the option for each percentage unit change in interest rates.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;systematic method to iterate through all the possible configurations of a search space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at each step in the backtracking algorithm, we start from a given partial solution, say, a = (a1, a2, …, ak) and try to extend it by adding another element at the end.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after extending it, we must test whether what we have so far is a solution - if so, we should print it, count it, or do what we want with it. If not, we must then check whether partial solution is still potentially extendible to some complete solution. If so recur and continue. If not, we delete the last element from a and try another possibility for that position, if one exists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backtracking templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;boolean finished = false;
backtrack(int a[], int k, data input) {
  int c[MAX_CANDIDATES];
  int ncandidates;
  int i;

  if (isASolution(a, k, input)) {
    processSolution(a, k, input);
  } else {
    k = k+1;
    construct_candidates(a, k, input, c &amp;amp;ncandidates);
  }

  for (i=0; i&amp;lt;ncandidates; i++&gt;) {
    a[k] = c[i];
    backtrack(a, k, input);
    if (finished) return;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isASolution(a, k, input)&lt;/code&gt; tests whether the first k elements of vector a are a complete solution for the given solution. The last argument, input, allows us to pass general information into the routine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;construct_candidates(a, k, input, c, ncandidates)&lt;/code&gt; - this routine fills an array &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; with the complete set of possible candidates for the kth position of a, given the contents of the first k -1 positions. The number of candidates returned in this array is denoted by ncandidates.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have you learned?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a classic application for backtracking algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s lots of solutions but none of them really shares the approach on how to get to the solution and how to TDD it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I were a little confuse on how to mark and unmark the position we have visited, but it turns out that the simplest thing is just avoid side-effects for the currentPosition parameter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still don’t like the side-effects I have on QueenPositions to keep track all of the possible solutions on queen positions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strategy I followed?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was on my bucket list to read through these programming challenges and algorithm design manual from Steven S Skiena as it seems to have good documentation on how to design algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with smallest solution is n=4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s expensive to go through 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; true/false vector for 8x8 board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to make a backtracking program efficient enough to solve interesting problems, we must &lt;strong&gt;prune the search space by terminating every search path the instant it becomes clear it cannot lead to a solution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since no 2 queens can occupy the same column, we know that the n columns of a complete solution must form a permutation of n, this reduce the search space to 8! = 40320.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to start from the client first/intention first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid using getter (help to reasoning where to put the behavior to avoid the getter method)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to use approvals, but needs to reset the approved file whenever I need to change the test name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;here’s the PR -&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonytvo/n-queens/pull/1&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tonytvo/n-queens/pull/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;takes about 2 mins and 500MB to find solution for 12x12 board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have you learned?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems like as soon as we give Quality an abstraction, we can remove more duplication code around increase/decrease quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it seems like verifyAllCombinations is handy, but it’s not available as part of jest snapshot testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, simplify the condition to true/false after the condition is flipped to the top level then leverage ‘Alt+Enter’ to simplify the conditions as much as possible (instead of manually remove dead-code or code that is highlighted as red from test-coverage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;couldn’t get the code highlight for warnings and not-covered works as the demonstrated video from Llewellyn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it seems like for … forEach … stream is a pattern in languages that support stream/functional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a better and easier way to wrap primitive fields
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;typically, add new field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isolate the accessor/updater to the primitive field to reduce the reference to the field that I want to wrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make set/get using both new and old field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch the set/get using the new field as primary field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the old field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove as many side-effect (command function) as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a strategy I followed?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flip conditional with as little effort as possible as demonstrate by Llewellyn Falco
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp6oSVDdbXQ&amp;#x26;ab_channel=CraftHubEvents&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp6oSVDdbXQ&amp;#x26;ab_channel=CraftHubEvents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid mutable state, creating new object instead of updating the state of the object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the steps I followed?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RefactoringCombos/ArlosCommitNotation&quot;&gt;Arlo commit notation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Over the duration of this course, I’m sure we would discuss many patterns regarding mobbing. I hope those discussions could be documented somewhere so we can refer back to it and improve on it later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the moment, I see this topic as an iterative process to hash out some patterns that we would agree would be useful to our daily work and we would use it in our daily work and in our ensembles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hence, I was thinking of accepted/proposed, when it’s in proposed means it’s something we have discussed but we haven’t adopted to our daily working/ensembles yet. When it’s accepted, it means that we would do it in our ensembles and daily work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe it’s a wrong way to look at it, so maybe it makes more sense to have pain points section and the patterns section to address those pain points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Avoid criticizing others by following patterns such as:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people feel that they’re attacked or being criticized, the conversation becomes much harder and prevents people from contributing further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would rather do X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel uncomfortable doing X because Y&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When navigating and don’t know the direction, feel free to ask “I don’t know where to go next, Can someone help me?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s better to try it than debate/argues about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the driver doesn’t understand the instruction, feel free to say so and ask for more details
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intention, location, details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendly, Kindness, Consideration, and Respect atmosphere, which would create psychology safety to help the team improve&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reduce waste time and energy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e.: setting up the environment before joining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensemble Summary Pattern
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;summarize the intent of the previous navigator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red button to hit when someone has some tests to add&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X is &lt;strong&gt;future&lt;/strong&gt; Y, it’s a way to avoid using &lt;strong&gt;X is better than Y&lt;/strong&gt;. it’s a way to say &lt;strong&gt;I care, but I don’t mind y or x, I know y is an intermediate step for X anyway.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driver should use search more often compare to scrolling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobber should try to engage more with Driver/Navigator (.i.e: providing helpful information) as long as they do not try to control the driver/navigator
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;tricks in helping describe ideas in code
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write pseudo-code in English or your own native language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe the intention what you try to accomplish with the loop, filter, map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the loop is complicated, try to describe how the key data structures inside the loop are evolved through each iteration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance between the discussion and the code
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the discussion is too long, mob ask the group to continue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at any moment, you’re stuck and don’t know what just happened? please speak up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you notice something to discuss/debates, write that down, and have that discussion at the end of the session, or wrote that down in the slack channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show up part-way through and you’re very welcome to announce your arrivals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notes from open space mob sessions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires people to have/get the skill in crucial conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impossible to rate individual performance when you mob fulltime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;law of contributing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do you have anything to contribute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can you learn from the session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people that dominates from the mob/ensemble could be rejected from the ensemble because of law of contributing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the task is known, take the mob to create a generator for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;introduce indirection steps to avoid big steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonytvo/introduce-indirection-layer&quot;&gt;Introduce an indirection layer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;read it, understand it, and put the information in the code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean up as we go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep track of which clean-up items to propose so that we can eventually do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it’s appropriate to isolate production code into their own file/module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe follow domain oriented guidelines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a note, we started it out with production code and test code are closed together because it would be easier for us to move in small steps. The production code is still changing quite a bit and we’re not sure what kind of abstraction/API we want to publish yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organize the source code so that the public API functions are closer to the top of the file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you aren’t sure how to do something, consider these things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do you already know how to do? maybe you can get there, but “the long way”. If you understand the long way better, you can turn this into a vocabulary problem: I don’t know enough shortcuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how far can you get before you’re stuck? once you’re stuck, you can ask a more specific question, which might lead to collecting a new “word”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can you get what you want another way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to practice solving the same problem in different ways and compare/contrast solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stub query/expect action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does the tests detect query or side effect, if it detect side-effects, we would like to make that side effects as direct as possible, like verifying calling the message on the interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When to do inside out (jump to details)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the risks in the details/certain tasks/components are large/noticeable and you want to mitigate the risks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wbitdd2-prerelease-discuss.jbrains.ca/t/noticing-signals-for-getting-stuck-when-test-driving/108/4?u=ttrung.vo&quot;&gt;https://wbitdd2-prerelease-discuss.jbrains.ca/t/noticing-signals-for-getting-stuck-when-test-driving/108/4?u=ttrung.vo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: “I need a thing to do X. I think library L can be made to do X. I’d better check that before I continue here.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the next steps are not clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When to do outside in (jump back to the big pictures)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you feel there’s a risk in missing some important details and it could delay the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you have difficulty in thinking about tests/what to test, it’s good to think in term of one level higher in the call stacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“when in doubt, zoom out”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patience in practicing evolutionary design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“programmers do not allow the various refactoring patterns to become so easy/comfortable that their fingers can execute them without conscious thought. This interferes with their progress because they have to switch more often among the questions “which refactorings will improve this design?” and “how do I perform this micro-step?” If they don’t become able to perform the micro-steps (a sequence of 3-7 nano steps) &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt;, then they might not breakthrough from “I know how to safely lead the design where I want it to go” to the more-powerful “I can just start removing duplication and improving names and a good design will emerge”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t get me wrong: the first of these two outcomes is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, but the second of these two outcomes is &lt;em&gt;much better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One consequence of never breaking through is that the programmer will miss out on finding helpful designs that are simpler than the ones that their intuition can see.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Independence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps to decide whether an object hides too much or hides the wrong information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has no built-in knowledge about the system in which it executes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should not use terms from multiple domains, unless it’s part of a bridging layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with the consumer of the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expressing the highest level of intention possible from the client/consumer perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another strategy is to use the pieces already there to build the next test. In the process, I often identify one small piece that is missing or identifies 2 pieces that don’t quite fit together yet. In either case, I see a smaller, clearer goal: write the missing piece or refactor so that A and B can connect together more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“if the implementation is wrong, how would a business person know?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that helps me to write the tests in higher-level language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not only “business person”. This is one of those questions to ask when you have trouble writing a test: “if the implementation were wrong, how would I know? what would I check?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build the things/abstraction we need in the test and move it to production code later
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“This is One way that the tests can drive the design, it reminds me of the chapter in the The Goal where the factory engineers a sale for the first time.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vocabulary problem
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because you don’t know enough “words” (options) to choose from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to build your vocabulary, you need to expose yourself to more “words”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;first, write a summary of the book to get a high-level overview of the topics of the book cover (I often copied from previous summaries to get things started and update the summaries as I go along)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then, elaborate/dig deeper into each topic wherever the curiosity takes you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the trick to retention is not to read it once but to write a good summary and review it often as much as you can.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it’s appropriate to isolate production code into their own file/module?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe follow domain oriented guidelines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a note, we started it out with production code and test code are closed together because it would be easier for us to move in small steps. The production code is still changing quite a bit and we’re not sure what kind of abstraction/API we want to publish yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the patterns for removing duplication?

&lt;li&gt;???&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is intelligence made visible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People think that design is styling. Design is not style. It’s not about giving shape to the shell and not giving a damn about the guts. Good design is a renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need, and beauty to produce something that the world didn’t know it was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is intelligence made visible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Design is] a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is design? it’s where you stand with a foot in 2 worlds - the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes - and you try to bring the 2 together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design isn’t just to satisfy requirements, but also to uncover requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perfection is not reached when there is nothing to be added anymore, but when there is nothing to be left out anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the design process, at its best, integrates the aspirations of art, science, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to say that something is designed means it has intentions that go beyond its function. Otherwise, it’s just planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good design defuses the tension between functional and aesthetic goals precisely because it works within the boundaries defined by the functional requirements of communication problem. Unlike the fine arts, which exists for their own sake, design must always solve a particular real-world problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in practice, designing seems to proceed by oscillating between sub-solution and sub-problem areas, as well as decomposing the problem and combining sub-solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you specify something to be designed, tell what properties you need, not how they are to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the trick is to hold “process” off long enough to permit great design to occur, so that the lesser issues can be debated once the great design is on the table - rather than smothering it in the cradle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good design is good business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you think it’s expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all… good design must primarily serve people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point: design is inevitable. The alternative to good design is bad design, not no design at all. Everyone makes design decisions all the time without realizing it - like Moliere’s M. Jourdain who discovered he had been speaking prose all his life, and good design is simply the result of making these decisions consciously, at the right stage, and in consultation with others as the need arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a good design is not the one that correctly predicts the future, it’s one that makes adapting to the future affordable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we’ve probably designed 4000 products at IDEO over my career, and for every one of them I’d like to send a little note with it that says, “I’m sorry that it’s in this present state. Given what I know now, if I could start over again it would be a lot better”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is easy. All you do is stare at the screen until drops of blood form on your forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ease of use and ease of learning are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;computer design is often bad design done on a computer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our opportunity as designers, is to learn how to handle the complexity, rather than shy away from it, and to realize that the big art of design is to make complicated things simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no, Watson, this was not done by accident, but by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is about making things good (and then better) and right (and fantastic) for the people who use and encounter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never design a building before I’ve seen the site and met the people who will be using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the only important thing about design is how it relates to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a design isn’t finished until somebody is using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;IQ: cognitive intelligence, your ability to learn; a set of ability that doesn’t change overtime (except in cases of traumatic injury)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EQ: emotional intelligence, your skills of being aware of your emotions and those of others along with managing your emotions and your relationships; a skill that you can learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personality: your temperament or style; a preference that is stable over a lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 statements/characteristics to define emotionally intelligent people
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They listen and learn from criticism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They maintain a positive (solution mode) attitude to difficult situations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They manage anxiety, fear, anger and all emotions appropriately in all situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They recognize how their behaviors affect others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are empathetic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have discipline and are self-motivated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They listen even if they disagree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They look for ways to improve when things don’t go according to plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EI is about figuring out how to apply, adapt, and deliver based on the needs of the person we’re with and what stage of the process they’re in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own it, Face it, Feel it, Ask it, Drive it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes, our subconscious mind causes us to try and validate our emotional responses consciously. For example, if you’re not feeling great, you might look for ways that the day is bad or getting worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the power of pause: pausing after someone’s answered a question or said something (for dramatic effect) to encourage them to draw upon their subconscious mind and bring deeper thoughts/feelings to the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify our own beliefs and values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Our minds are what created fear, and our mind is the only thing that can smash through it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself: ‘Do I want to change this? Why do I want to change this?’ What stands to happen if I don’t change this? What stands to happen if I don’t change this?’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accepting that something is going to happen and that the only thing we can control is how we choose to respond is where EI comes in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sympathy is feeling sorry for someone, whereas empathy is recognizing the emotional response someone is having and how it feels to have that emotional response
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting yourself in their shoes is dangerous because that typically comes with judgement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t need to know what has happened, just recognize what emotion and the severity of that emotion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize which emotion the person is feeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recall the last time you felt that emotion
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the best and worst thing someone could have said or done to you in that moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First thing we want is to be heard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help the other person gain control of their emotions and feel a connection&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m either good at something or I’m not -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I can improve my skills with effort and practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when people give me feedback, it feels like criticism -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I appreciate it; it helps me learn and grow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m just not good at math -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Math is challenging for me, but I know I can improve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m too shy to speak in front of the class -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;With practice, I can become more confident and improve my public speaking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m already a really good writer. I don’t need to get any better -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;There’s always room for improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;naturally smart people don’t need to try hard to succeed -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No one is born smart. We can all improve with time, effort and persistence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other people’s successes make me feel bad about myself -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Other people’s successes encourage and inspire me. They show me what is possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful people are lucky/talented and have never experienced failure -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Failure is part of success. Most successful people have failed many times, but they succeeded because they didn’t quit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I was as good at baseball as you. It’s not fair -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Your skills as a baseball player inspire me. Do you have any tips to help me improve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s embarrassing when I make a mistake -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;everyone makes mistakes, and mistakes are opportunities to learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I don’t try new or hard things, then I won’t fail -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I have to try new and difficult things in order to grow, even if I fail at first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I fail, I get frustrated and give up -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When I fail or get frustrated, I try again using the lessons I’ve learned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure means it is time to give up -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I only truly fail when I stop trying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t do that -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I can’t do that yet. I’m going to keep going, try new strategies, and/or ask for help until I understand it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I don’t improve right away, I get frustrated. I start to criticize myself -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I know improvement takes time, and I celebrate the small steps. Even a little progress makes a difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ignoring feelings doesn’t make them go away. They will resurface. Face them when they come and try to work through them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay attention to how an emotion physically affects you (increased heart rate, dry mouth, tightening in stomach, neck, back; fast, shallow breathing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for practice, close your eyes and remember a high-emotion incident. Notice what physical symptoms you get simply thinking about it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to the situations or people that trigger your emotions. Think about why you might find those situations or people irksome.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about how your emotional reaction may make things worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to see things from the other’s perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formulate a calmer way to express your emotions and effectively convey your points.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’re stuck in a down mood, it’s not a good time to make important decisions. Briefly reflect on recent events that may have brought on the mood.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remind yourself of your values and how well you are currently living up to them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your core values and things that you have said or done recently that violate them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, there is a big difference between how you see yourself and how others see you. When you ask for feedback, seek specific examples and look for similarities in what people tell you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People vary in how they react to stress. Which physical symptoms are common for you?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An upset stomach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pounding headache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canker sores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back spasms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shallow breaths deprive your brain of oxygen. This leads to poor concentration, forgetfulness, mood swings, anxiety and lack of energy. Breathe slowly and deeply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Emotion vs Reason List
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What Your Emotions are telling you to do” Vs “What Your Reason is Telling to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are your emotions clouding your judgement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is your reason blocking important cues from your emotions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you feel yourself becoming frustrated or angry, count to 10 with a slow breath between each number. The focus on counting will engage your rational brain&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your brain responds to the nerves and muscles in your face to determine your emotional state. Read or watch something that you find funny.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tip: Hold a pencil between your teeth to activate the muscles used in smiling.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a strong relationship between what you think and how you feel, both physically and emotionally. Learn to control your self-talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the following: “I always”, “I never”, “I’m an idiot”, “It’s all my fault”, “it’s all their fault” with “Just this time”, “Sometimes”, “I made a mistake”, “We each are responsible for our actions”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least every 2 weeks, think about important things that might happen. Make a list of activities that you will take if the change occurs. Make a list of things you could do now to prepare for the possible change.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On an index card, list who will be at the event along with any talking points you want to use. Also list anything you agreed to bring so you don’t forget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a person is speaking, focus on listening to that person, instead of letting your mind wander to other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a point to try to learn something from listening to the person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk around, noticing people’s workspaces and how people move around the area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to pick up on people’s feelings and how others affect your feelings.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch some movies with the objective of watching the character interactions and conflicts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice how the characters handle the conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenge yourself to pick up on clues that conflict may be building.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening requires focus, it’s far more than hearing the words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to the tone, speed, and volume of the voice and how those fluctuate. Are those sending the message beyond what the words say? You won’t know unless you focus fully on the person.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Find a public place to watch how people interact with one another. Notice body language.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When interacting with those of a different culture, observe their body language and manner of speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you aren’t sure what behavior would be acceptable, ask questions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To confirm your interpretation of body language, use a reflective question. Example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It looks like you are feeling down about something. Did something happen?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself, “If I were this person, how would I [feel, react, respond]?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about how the person has reacted in similar situations.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeking feedback gives you a chance to see how others may view your behavior.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you intend as helpful responses and behaviors may appear unhelpful to other people. For example, others may interpret your attempt at courteous listening as lack of interest in the topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you enter a room, scan it for energy level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you describe the mood [enthusiastic, bored, somber, playful, cautious, angry]?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice how people arrange themselves, alone or in groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which people are animated and which are subdued?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze how those who know you well view you. “Upsides of My Style” Vs “Downsides of My Style”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen carefully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for examples of what you have said or done that led the person to view you in a certain way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether you agree with the feedback or not, thank the person for being willing to share their perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the feedback, think seriously about what you heard. How did you react to it emotionally and rationally?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a plan to make some adjustments so the person knows you took their feedback seriously.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;To build trust, you will need to be consistent in your words and actions over time. You will need to do what you say you will do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradually share things about yourself so the other person understands you better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch and listen closely to gain an understand of the other person.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Don’t let your anger control you. Be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for hte right purpose, and in the right way.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Don’t avoid a person with whom you must interact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strive to put boundaries in place to make your interaction as helpful as possible for both of you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than stifle or try to change people’s feelings, simply acknowledge them. You don’t have to agree with their feelings, but it helps to let them know you notice their struggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you sense that a person is upset of troubled, here is a process that may help:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It appears something is troubling you.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I’m sorry you are upset”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Do you want to talk about it?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If they do, then listen carefully”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarize what you heard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When someone does something well, don’t hesitate to let them know you notice it and appreciate it.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vary the way to do this. For example, try some of these:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In person thank you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email note&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greeting card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inexpensive gift tailored to their preferences.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at both sides to figure out where the interaction went off track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say something neutral to help you take a pause. It can be as simple as “This is hard”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use open communication to ask someone how to do/achieve something, if they still don’t do it keep emotion out of it, remaining calm and factual and tell them what they need to do. Set clear expectations, including consequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe ask the reason why they don’t want to do it?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start your conversation by stating the common ground you share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask the person to share his or her point of view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resist the urge to plan a rebuttal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help the other person understand your side. Communicate clearly and directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if there is disagreement, once you understand both perspectives, find a way to move the conversation to closure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the meeting, keep in touch with the person to see how they are doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pausing between points&lt;/strong&gt; allows the audience to take in your idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow down&lt;/strong&gt; when explaining unfamiliar concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate to express&lt;/strong&gt; not impress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk with a &lt;strong&gt;strong confident voice&lt;/strong&gt; (be conscious of the 3 V’s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only &lt;strong&gt;share what your audience must not forget&lt;/strong&gt; in terms of level of detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the &lt;strong&gt;3 What’s&lt;/strong&gt; to keep conversations organized (see below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;stories, examples and analogies&lt;/strong&gt; to make your points more memorable and relatable for the audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing up when presenting&lt;/strong&gt; gives you a wider range of motion, you typically have more visual gestures (talking with your hand) and your audience can hear a difference in your voice (important even if you are in a voice only call)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen and ask open questions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not interrupt just listen, ask open ended question to keep them talking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will know they are done talking when they ask a question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledge and Pause
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn’t mean agreeing with the emotional response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledge what has happened and the circumstances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause is to ensure they have said everything they want/need to say&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we fix this?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Majority of people in this state already know what they want to happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List and confirm actions that will be taken, committing to time frame and ownership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following through with commitments is crucial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say “What else can I do to help?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the worst things that could possibly happen?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what’s the underlying core emotions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what’s my need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you either limit or mitigate the risk from occurring?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what would need to happen for this not to be a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what beliefs would you need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what training or skills? what emotions would you need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do you physically need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the easiest way to solve this?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the hardest way to solve this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the quickest way or the longest way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how would you feel if you solved this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do you want to feel like that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the first step to making this happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what could you do right now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you current responses make you feel? why is this a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you think you could leverage your mindset in different situations, to your advantage?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you think we can be more accommodating of each other’s dominant modalities in a collaborative setting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is our motivator/emotional driver?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are our values and beliefs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are our default emotional responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are our Style of Praise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are our style of feedback?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to Create a Connection?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you be empathetic if you have never felt the emotion someone is feeling before?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has anyone in your life stood out as being very empathetic? What did they do that made you feel this way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your EI profile?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What type of person are you? Work machine, analyst, innovator, tech guru, people lover?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behavior and relationships”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I could sum up emotional in 2 words, it would  be ‘own it’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;replace “why is this happening to me” with “what is this trying to teach me?”, everything shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“today I refuse to stress myself out about things I cannot control or change?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“be crazy, be stupid, be silly, be weird, be whatever, because life is too short to be anything but happy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our own minds is what created fear and our own mind is the only thing that can smash through it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin by asking yourself, “What emotion to I want to trigger in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself: ‘Do I want to change this? Why do I want to change this?’ What stands to happen if I don’t change this? What stands to happen if I don’t change this?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting that something is going to happen and that the only thing we can control is how we choose to respond is where EI comes in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock is to be held for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual investors are drawn into stocks during powerful bull markets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don’t appreciate the risks with stocks. And after they have suffered the inevitable loss, they sell.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No investor ever avoids losses at times, no matter how skilled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to estimate future stock returns is the DDM (Dividend Discount Method)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return = Dividend Yield + Dividend Growth Rate + Multiple Change
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend yield is the yield on the investment (Example – 2020 S+P 500 yield is 1.5%). The Dividend growth rate is historically 5%. And Multiple changes refer to the increase or decrease in the overall P/E ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dividend yield and dividend growth rate is the fundamental return (easy to estimate). The Multiple changes are the speculative return (impossible to estimate).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benjamin Graham – “In the short run, a stock market is a voting machine (speculative return), but in the long run, it is a weighing machine (fundamental return).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are ignorant of investment history are bound to repeat its mistakes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Bond durations of 6 months to 5 years are ideal for the risk dilution portion of the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something everyone knows isn’t worth knowing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the era’s conventional wisdom and then ignore it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year’s efficient frontier portfolio (high return at low risk or decent returns with no risk) will be nowhere near last year’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one consistently times the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some managers spend lots of money researching macroeconomic, political, and market analysis to determine which assets will perform best in the future. And this is a fool’s errand.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why? The market has already priced this information into the current price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective portfolio diversification can increase return while reducing risks. Achieving this benefit requires rebalancing the portfolio to its target or “policy” AA. This isn’t easy to do and almost always involves moving against the market sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term success in individual security selection and market timing is difficult to impossible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future cannot be predicted, so, therefore, it is nearly impossible to specify in advance what the best asset allocation will be. Our job is to find an AA that will do reasonably well under a wide range of circumstances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking to your target AA through thick and thin is much more important than picking the right AA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An optimizer will heavily favour those assets with high historical or assumed returns. This is a problem because asset returns tend to “mean revert.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can predict the inputs to the optimizer well enough, then you didn’t need an optimizer, to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t use an optimizer to try to develop an asset allocation. We can’t predict returns, standard deviations, or correlations accurately enough. And if we could, we wouldn’t need one anyway.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And optimizing historical returns is a one-way ticket to the poor house&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-diversified portfolio is not a free lunch. It does not come anywhere near eliminating risk. You will still suffer loss from time to time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversification not only reduces risks but also gives a “rebalancing bonus” or extra return from rigorous rebalancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefit is also psychological because you are getting into the habit of buying low and selling high. Thus, profiting by moving in the opposite direction of the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A distrust of “expert opinion” is one of the investors’ most useful tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also limits your exposure to only one market segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to forecast future optional portfolios by any technique&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual fund manager performance does not persist, and the return on stock picking is zero&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These managers ARE the market, so there is no way they can ALL perform above the mean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Ellis (an avid tennis player) first saw the data demonstrating a lack of money management skills. And He thought I had seen this before in tennis matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most amateur tennis matches winning or losing was less a matter of skill and more of a matter of playing conservatively and avoiding mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This applies to investors who buy and hold a diversified stock portfolio and usually come out on top (Indexing).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success in tennis and investing is less a matter of winning and more a matter of avoiding losing.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The easiest way to lose is to trade excessively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate loss avoidance strategy is to buy and hold the entire market or to index
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This reduces all the expenses associated with active management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunn’s Law – When an asset class does relatively well, an index fund in that class does even better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only money made from newsletters is from the subscriptions, not from taking the advice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers do not exhibit consistent stock-picking skill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody can time the market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the above 2 points, it is futile to select money managers based on past performance
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the above 3 points, the most rational way to invest in stocks is to use low cost passively managed index funds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Nobel winners have tried and failed (Long-Term Capital Management), what chance do I have? And during a bear market, stocks usually decline much faster than they advance during a bull market. But you don’t want to get out of the market then because you will miss the rally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term returns are usually higher when valuations are cheap and lower when they are expensive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Miller did the first study on cheap stocks called the Dow P/E strategy. He examined buying the ten lowest P/E stocks in the Dow from 1936-1964 and discovered that the lowest P/E stocks (those everyone hates) outperformed the market, and the highest P/E stocks (those everyone loves) greatly underperformed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreman has observed that “value” stocks tend to fall less in price than “growth” stocks when earnings disappoint. Conversely, “value” stocks tend to rise more in price than “growth” stocks when earnings exceed expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To put it another way, good companies are generally bad stocks, and bad companies are generally good stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has puzzled academics EMH theorists why these value-type strategies have worked so well for so long, even after they were discovered. (The market should have arbitrated this away long ago). The reason the strategies still work is that cheap companies are dogs, and most people cannot bring themselves to buy them. This concept is very difficult for investors and money managers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best explanation for value stocks can be found in Robert Haugen’s The New Finance: The Case Against Efficient Markets. In 1993 the highest 20% P/E stocks (Growth) had an average P/E of 42. The earnings yield was 2.36% or 1/42. The lowest 20% P/E stocks (Value) had a P/E of 12. The earnings yield was 8.38% or 1/12. So, if you bought growth stocks in 1993, you received $2.36 for every $100 invested. If you bought value stocks, you received $8.38 in earnings for every $100 invested. That means growth stocks’ earnings have to grow 3x larger than value stocks to break even. The growth stocks did have higher earnings than value, but not enough to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavioural (people don’t like buying bad companies) and increased risk (companies are not in great financial shape) explain value companies’ higher returns than growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value companies tend to do better than growth during bear markets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividend Discount Method (DDM) formulated by John Burr Williams in 1938 was formulated by a simple idea. Since all companies eventually go bankrupt, the value of a stock, bond or the entire market is simply the value of all its future dividends discounted to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, its value must be reduced or discounted to reflect the fact you won’t receive it today.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reduction is called the Discount Rate (DR)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DR is determined by the cost of money (Risk-Free Rate) plus the risk to the lender
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safer investments have a lower DR, and risker investments have a higher DR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DR can also be thought of as the expected return on the asset
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower risks = lower DR = Lower expected return/Higher Present Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher risks = higher DR = Higher expected return/Lower Present Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formula – Reasonable Price = (Annual Dividend Amount)/(DR – Dividend Growth Rate)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But you can make this formula say anything you want, depending on your inputs. So be careful with this formula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic asset allocation is the possibility of varying your policy allocation because of changing market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only people who have mastered fixed asset allocation and the required rebalancing should consider dynamic asset allocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He used to recommend changing your equity/bond AA based on conditions, but that doesn’t work anymore. Now he only recommends changing equity allocations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When stocks get more expensive, their future returns are likely to be lower; when stocks are very cheap, future returns are likely to be higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on this, it is not a terrible idea to change your AA slightly in the opposite direction based on valuations, but not by much.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target AA, you purchase more of an asset that has declined in price and is thus cheaper.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you increase the target portfolio weighting of an asset when its price declines and gets cheaper, you are simply rebalancing in a more vigorous form – you are “overbalancing.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not change your AA based on changes in economic or political conditions or analyst recommendations. That is a poor idea
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the authors’ opinion, overbalancing is likely to increase returns if done correctly. But few investors have the nerve and discipline to rebalance, and “overbalancing” requires even more of that nerve and discipline so few should try it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings experience risk in the short term. This is because, in nature, our ancestors had to focus on short-term risks to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, this is of less value in modern society, specifically in investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanguard and DFA are great choices for funds. The shareholders own Vanguard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) vs Lump Sum investing – from a purely financial point of view, it is usually better to put your money to work immediately. However, if you are not used to owning risk assets, then it might be best to go slow and DCA your way into the market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DCA – involves investing the same amount regularly in a given fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not underestimate the discipline that is sometimes necessary to carry out a successful DCA program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value Averaging (VA) – Is another technique for investing in the market (read the book for more information on how to do it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become familiar with the long-term history of the behaviour of different classes of stocks and bonds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolios behave differently than their constituent parts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A safe portfolio does not necessarily exclude very risky assets. Even the investor who seeks the safest possible portfolio will own some risky assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investor’s objective then is not to find the efficient frontier, rather the goal is to find a portfolio mix that will come reasonably close to the mark under a broad range of circumstances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the behaviour of your whole portfolio, not its parts. Some will be doing very well or very badly at times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets are smarter than you are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not run with the crowd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on market valuations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in your policy AA should be made only in response to valuations changes and in a direction opposite the market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good companies are usually bad stocks; bad companies are usually good stocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Favor a “value” approach to investing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to change your asset allocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Reasons to change your AA
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial goal is well within reach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You realize you will not need all your money during your lifetime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your risk tolerance isn’t what you thought it was&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any AA changes should require deep thinking and even-handed judgement. Don’t make changes during times of duress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allocate our investments across multiple asset classes to reduce overall portfolio risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invest broadly within each class to eliminate the risk of owning any single security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your costs down, including taxes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalance periodically&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AA The Three-Step Approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many different asset classes do I want to own?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How “conventional” of a portfolio do I want?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much risk can I and do I want to take?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much complexity can you tolerate and tracking error?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The law of diminishing returns applies to asset classes. You get a diversification boost from the first several. After that, you are just amusing yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more complex your AA, the more tracking error you will get vs the index (Like the S+P 500). Do you have to ask yourself how much that will bother you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracking error means that your portfolio will behave very differently than everyone else’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If that bothers you, then you need a simpler portfolio. If it doesn’t, then you can be more complex.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing the number of asset classes will improve diversification but will also increase your work and tracking error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your precise AA will depend on three factors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerance to tracking error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of assets you wish to own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerance for risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases returns while decreasing risks. A most important concept in portfolio theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two assets with positive returns should not have persistent, highly negative correlations.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixing assets with uncorrelated returns reduces risk. You can find these.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the long run, though, meaningful negative (inverse) correlations are never seen. That would be too good to be true if they did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimal Asset Allocation of the last 20 years is unlikely to look anything like the one for the next 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The optimal AA can only be known in retrospect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking by your AA policy through thick and thin I much more important than picking a “best” AA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good idea is to decide on a static percentage of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments that fit your needs and then maintain that allocation for a long, long, long time. Then rebalance as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;protect-your-wealth&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#protect-your-wealth&quot; aria-label=&quot;protect your wealth permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;protect your wealth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a nation, we are not saving enough in retirement accounts to make up for diminishing Social Security benefits and other traditional sources of income&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10% savings of pre-tax income is a good target for most people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a fondness for seeing patterns where they don’t exist. Stocks that have done well in the past are expected to continue to do well, and stocks that have done poorly are expected to continue to do poorly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid following the herd and investing in the hottest sectors or stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t chase popular investment styles. Stick with your plan and give it time to work out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to predict which type of fund will outperform any given year. Therefore, the best strategy is to hold a diversified portfolio that contains all types and stick with it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more a mutual fund charges in fees, the lower the expected return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take caution when you get financial advice. Most of it is just salesmanship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools have spent lots of money and hours trying to figure out which actively managed mutual fund managers will likely outperform in the future. They discovered two facts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funds with low fees tend to outperform the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unreliable to assume that managers who have beaten the market in the past will continue to do so over the long term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On any given year, many actively managed funds will beat the index fund. But in the long run, the index fund will be at the top&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce your estimated Social Security check at retirement by 60-70% and an increase of 5-7 years for retirement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treat Social Security and defined pension plans as a separate account and don’t use them in your equity/bond calculations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short term, it is nearly impossible to predict the movement of the stock market. But over the long term, the performance of the stock market is predictable because it follows the growth of the U.S. economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Growth (Corporate Earnings or GDP) +Dividend (Yield)+Speculation (P/E ratio) = market return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short run, speculation creates volatility in stock prices, but economic growth is the real driver of returns in the long term. You can’t guess what P/E ratio the market will assign in the future, so don’t try&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to forecast the movement of the inflation rate, but you can limit risk by purchasing short-term bonds. They don’t have the volatility of long-term bonds. You do get extra yield from long-term bonds, but it does not justify the added interest rate risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your investments have a low correlation with each other, or you don’t get the benefits of diversification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a long-term strategic asset allocation or “buy and hold.” No predictions are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful lifelong investment experience hinges on three critical steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of a prudent financial plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full implementation of that plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The discipline to maintain that plan in good AND bad times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6-12-month Emergency Fund recommended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in the next hot item is very difficult to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking a manager who can pick the next hot item is equally difficult to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not select mutual funds on past performance. Past performance is not an indication of future results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Bills are “risk-free” but can still lose money due to taxes and inflation. If their - purchasing power doesn’t keep up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High volatility means erratic returns. Low volatility means more consistent returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot eliminate all risk from a portfolio, but you can reduce it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will lose money during some times. Don’t try to market time your way out of it. You can’t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do NOT abandon your plan because you lose money. In the last 50 years, the market is up 4 years for every one down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning several asset classes is better than owning a few&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose asset classes that have positive real returns and lower correlation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can select a good asset allocation but not a perfect one. Don’t overanalyze&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to know which asset classes will perform well at any given time. Therefore, it is important to retain ALL asset classes in your portfolio at all times and to rebalance these annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign stocks are great for US investors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do not always move in correlation with the US market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They trade in foreign currency, which is another diversifier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no known way to design a portfolio that is fully hedged against downturns while fully participating in the upswings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for mutual funds that have low expense ratios and no redemption fees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prefer index mutual funds and ETFs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay away from high-cost illiquid investments unless you know what you are doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to stay invested during all market conditions to benefit from the gains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run of investing, you are compensated for taking risks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, if you seek safety, your returns will be low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced investors understand risk and reward are intertwined&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the easiest ways to spot investment fraud is the promise of excessive returns with low risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no risk-free investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practitioners view risk as investment volatility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals view risk as losing money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investments with less risk of income disruptions have lower expected returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio risk cannot be eliminated, but it can be controlled with an asset allocation strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not expect high returns without high risk. Do not expect safety without correspondingly low returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer a risky asset is held, the less chance of a poor result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sign of a dangerously overbought market is a generalized underappreciation of the risks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonsystematic Risk – Risk that disappears with diversification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systematic Risk – Risk that cannot be diversified away&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real assets are almost always imperfectly correlated (Mostly positive) in real life (An above-average return in one is somewhat more likely to be associated with an above-average return in the other)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is difficult to find two uncorrelated assets, and it is practically impossible to find 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncorrelated is 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the inverse is -1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfect is +1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation is measured on a -1 to +1 scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+0.3 or greater is positive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-0.3 or less is negative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-0.3 to 0.3 is noncorrelated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If two investments move in the same direction simultaneously, they have a positive correlation. If they move in opposite directions, they have a negative correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want investments that have a lower correlation to each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t purchase new investments that have a high positive correlation with investments you already have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative correlation is theoretically ideal when selecting investments, but this doesn’t occur in the real world. Typically, the best asset pairs you will find are noncorrelated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlations are dynamic, not static. And you can’t guess when/how they will change. For example – The S+P 500 and Intermediate-term treasury bonds have been between +0.49 to -0.42 correlated in the last 20 years (1990-2009). The average was 0, so they are noncorrelated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation is not the only reason to invest. The security must also have a positive expected rate of return. It is impossible to find two negatively correlated asset classes that both earn a positive rate of return. Noncorrelated is your best bet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During extreme volatility, when you want low correlation among asset classes, positive correlation increases drastically across all classes. Especially during bear markets or disasters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a given degree of risk, there is a portfolio that will deliver the most return. But this can only be known in retrospect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect portfolio can only be known in retrospect. So, don’t overanalyze&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in real life, risks, returns, and correlations of various assets fluctuate considerably over time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two types of investors, those who don’t know where the market is headed and those who don’t know that they don’t know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For all practical purposes, there is no such thing as stock picking skill
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those early high returns attract a large number of investors who wind up with average returns (if they are lucky)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;rebalancing&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#rebalancing&quot; aria-label=&quot;rebalancing permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;rebalancing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing is the most difficult because it forces you to sell what is going up and buy what went down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to rebalance through changes in what you buy, try not to rebalance by selling assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing increases long-term portfolio performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It instills the investor with the discipline to buy low and sell high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If two assets have similar long-term returns and risks are not perfectly correlated, then investing in a fixed rebalanced mix of the two not only reduces risks but also actually increases return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The excess return, though is not obtained without rebalancing. It forces you to buy low and sell high to rebalance your asset allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing is based on a theory called regression to the mean. That is, there is a natural tendency in the marketplace for all broad asset classes to return close to their history risk profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you rebalance, you sell some of the winners to buy some of the losers. It may feel counterintuitive at first, but it follows the logic of buying low and selling high&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calendar-based rebalancing is a good idea. Pick a date and rebalance it, then. You are more likely not to procrastinate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing only works if the investments in the portfolio don’t act the same way. You want assets that don’t correlate with each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing in your tax-advantaged accounts every year or two should be ok&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try not to rebalance your taxable accounts or do it as little as possible. Try to rebalance through buying because rebalancing triggers taxable events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalance your portfolio at least 1 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not rebalance too frequently. Let momentum work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means rebalancing at most once per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investment in a total US stock market fund is a solid foundation for a US stock market allocation. Total Index is heavily weighted toward large-cap stocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your age x 1.5 for your % AA to a TDF. Example. 40 x 1.5 = 60% allocation to TDF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midcap indexes are highly correlated with total stock market indexes and are, therefore, a poor diversifier. You don’t need them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25% max dedicated toward factor tilts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to tilt, be patient and stick to your guns. Don’t chase returns. Once you decide to tilt, you need to stick with that strategy and not bailout of it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enemy of a good asset allocation is the quest for a perfect one. Fight the urge to be perfect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study in 1992 By Fama and French – Performance of a broadly diversified US stock portfolio relied on three primary risks axis to determine its return. 95% accuracy as to what the portfolio would return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A market risk or Beta – all portfolios move up or down to the total stock market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percent of small cap in the portfolio by weight – small stocks have higher returns and do not always correlate with the total stock market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percent of value orientation – value stocks have a higher return than growth and do not correlate with growth stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small-cap value index has outperformed growth with less standard deviation from 1979-2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a 50/50 value/growth index during this time added no return and increased standard deviation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small-cap stocks have higher expected returns but also higher standard deviation than large-cap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This occurs in foreign markets too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small Cap value, along with the total stock market, is a good choice in your portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Layers of Mutual Fund Costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expense Ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bid-Ask Spreads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market-Impact Costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advantages – Can be traded throughout the day, does not generate capital gains taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disadvantages – Incur commissions and spreads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks outperform almost all other assets in the long run because you are buying a piece of our almost constantly growing economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But then investors make the mistake of thinking the most profitable stocks to own must be those of the most rapidly growing companies (Growth Stocks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International equity provides currency diversification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global equity invests in both US and internationally. Not usually a good idea unless you have a very small amount of money and want diversification from 1 fund&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good idea to have both US AND International equities in your portfolio at all times. You don’t know which one will win. The US won from 1970-2001 then the International has won since&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada’s economy is weighted heavily toward finance, energy and basic materials. Canada has lots of natural resources and investing in them acts as a hedge against commodity prices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A permanent allocation to emerging market stocks is recommended. Emerging markets are very volatile. Recently Emerging markets have increased their correlation to US markets but this may or may not continue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the allocation to international stocks is about 30% of the equity portion of your portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent studies prove the size and value premium (F+F study above) works in international stocks as it does with the US. This means an international small cap is a good idea too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign stocks are subject to currency, political, trading, custody and regulatory risk. You must understand these risks. But they do provide diversification to a portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign stocks belong in everyone’s portfolio. The primary benefit is to reduce standard deviation or risks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diversified fixed-income portfolio enhances return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-cost bond mutual funds are an ideal way to invest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax considerations may be an important element in fixed income when investing in a taxable account&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond Structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short – 3 years or less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intermediate – 4 to 9 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long – 10+ years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer term bonds have higher interest rate risk. Longer maturity = higher rates. Opposite true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower quality bonds have higher credit risk. Lower credit rating = higher rates. Opposite true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield bonds have not only credit risks but the real danger that the issuers will default&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipal bonds are a good choice for people in higher tax brackets in taxable accounts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate is a separate asset class from stocks and bonds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REIT are a convenient way to invest in real estate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REITs have low correlation with stocks and bonds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all commercial lease contracts have a built-in inflation hedge. Therefore, REITs are a good inflation hedge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REITs are the simplest way to participate in the real estate market. They are also liquid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index Equity REITs and ETFs are a good choice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REITs are divided into 3 categories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity – Real estate properties. Most pure holding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mortgage REITs – do not own property, they finance property. Bond investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid – Hold both&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10% allocation to REIT is enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not include home equity in your asset allocation models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity REITs are portfolios of apartments, hotels, malls, industrial buildings, and other rental property&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REIT’s and Precious Metals stocks can have a place in a portfolio even if they have lower expected returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are inflation hedges and likely to do well in an inflationary environment in which other stocks and bonds would be adversely affected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;behavioral&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#behavioral&quot; aria-label=&quot;behavioral permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Behavioral&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistic expectations are important to investment planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market volatility is more predictable than the market return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments with expected positive investment return and higher volatility have a higher expected return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All investments have risk. Even T-Bills which is inflation risk. There is no risk-free investment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than 12 funds because it gets too complex with higher fees and diminishing returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not change your percentage of equity/bond based on what you think the market will do. Once you select a ratio, stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people can’t stomach a 100% equity portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-developed plan works only when the investor sticks to the plan through good and bad times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sensible investment plan never fails an investor. The investor fails the plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to be more optimistic about stocks after the market goes up and less after it goes down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors give too much weight to recent information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to buy investments that have had a recent run-up in performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors label investments good or bad depending on the price relative to where they bought it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are reluctant to admit errors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overconfident investors generally believe they have more knowledge and information than they do. Therefore, they tend to trade too much and underperform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Males tend to be overconfident&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Females tend to do better at sticking to a long-term plan and usually perform better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not change your investment strategy during a bear market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can rebalance without hesitation, even during bad markets, your risk tolerance is good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors tend to suffer from overconfidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many portfolio failures occur when investors take on too much risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recency bias – the biggest mistake most experienced investors make&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to extrapolate recent trends indefinitely into the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try as hard as you can to identify the current financial wisdom so that you can ignore it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2000, when the book was published, the US was doing better than foreign stocks. What were the experts saying at that time?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay at home for higher returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy only companies you know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversify abroad at your peril&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do diversify abroad, only do where you can drink the water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of recency, and do not be overly impressed with the asset class returns over less than 2-3 decades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unhappy with the degree of risk in the portfolio, you have two ways to reduce it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employ less risky individual assets (Not a good idea) – like adding a large cap for small-cap stocks, domestic for foreign stocks, and utility for industrial stocks. It changes the dynamics of the portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stick with your basic asset allocation and replace some of your stock AA with short-term bonds. (Good idea)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk Dilution – if you believe that you have arrived at an effective stock allocation, it is generally a better idea to employ risk dilution as this leaves the stock AA undisturbed
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A conservative risk-averse strategy will almost always involve at least a small amount of exposure to very risky individual assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average investor suffers from overconfidence and thinks they can beat the market, but this is a mathematical impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average investor must obtain the market return minus expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors suffer from recency bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When prices fall, investors’ estimate of future returns goes lower too. This is irrational.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors tend to overweight more recent data and underweight older data
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most investors are “convex” traders who buy equities as they rise and sell as they fall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opposite is a “concave” investor who buys as prices fall and sells as they rise
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a world dominated by convex traders, it is advantageous to be a concave trader and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interpretation-of-financial-statements/&quot;&gt;interpretation of financial statements by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tracking how the money flows through a business is like watching a plumber determine where the leak is in a house. He starts at the source, where the water enters the main valve into the house (the net income), and ends at the sink (the growing/decreasing equity and/or dividend). A well-managed, profitable business will show a strong cash flow through the accounts’ plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the accounting system is based on double entries. For every debit, there must be a credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cash-based accounting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transaction is recorded only when cash is physically or digitally received into the bank account, not when the service or product is provided or received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this might be alright for “mom and pop”-style businesses. Accounting laws do not allow larger companies to conduct cash-based accounting. This is because it represents a low and delayed way of tracking revenues and expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accrual accounting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accrual accounting simply states that expenditures must be recorded when incurred and not when paid. Similarly, revenue must be recorded when services or goods outflow, not when the payment is realized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publicly traded companies are based on accrual accounting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although accrual accounting might count funds that haven’t been paid, it provides a more precise and realistic picture of the company’s performance - especially for stock investors. A great way to account for any inconsistencies caused by accrual accounting is by thoroughly understanding the cash flow statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;revenues from secondary activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such as interests from cash sitting in interest-bearing savings accounts producing revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secondary activities are usually included in an income statement under the net interest income line. It is sometimes referred to as other income if it also includes other revenues not made from financial activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such as gain (loss) on the sale of assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s essential to understand that gains are not considered operating income. That is also why gains and losses are sometimes referred to as extraordinary income (expense)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;expenses generated from primary activities&lt;/strong&gt; are only expenses from producing operating revenues. This is listed on the income statement as “Cost of Revenue”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;expenses generated from secondary activities&lt;/strong&gt;: if the business makes an expense and doesn’t directly relate to the materials or labour used to make the primary product, it’s considered an expense generated from secondary activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such as sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and other operating expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;expenses from financial activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is disclosed as interest expenses, as they are not part of the daily business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;losses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a loss doesn’t relate directly to the primary activities of the company’s product or service, nor is it a part of daily operations. It is extraordinary. Graham would caution his students to pay close attention to extraordinary items and try to assess their impact on a business to manage and mitigate risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a loss is also the result of a difference in the value an asset is listed for on the balance sheet and the proceeds received from the sale of that asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this line is sometimes referred to as Sales or Turnover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;revenue is simply the number of goods sold multiplied by the price of the product or service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an informed investor, you might need more information regarding revenue generation - especially if the company has a deteriorating revenue stream. You could dig deeper into the 10K or 10Q, where you’ll find a net operating revenues section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cost of revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka cost of sales, costs of goods sold and production costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the costs that are related to making the company’s primary product or service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the emphasis is placed on direct costs because these arise due to per-unit sales rather than any other cost driver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an investor must know the composition of the direct costs associated with the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the investor must pay close attention to the trends in the cost of revenue. If sales are constant and the cost of revenue continues to grow, a negative trend is developing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gross profit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka margin or markup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gross profit is simply the revenue generated from core products and services less the direct costs associated with the production of goods or delivery of services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gross profit, in essence, is a measure of the organization’s efficiency - that is, the ability of the management to control its direct cost of revenue while simultaneously increasing sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as an investor, you cannot compare the gross profit between 2 different industries. This often leads to misleading assumptions and doesn’t provide a relative framework to assess a company’s performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sales and marketing expense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes, it is combined with Administration expenses and called SGA (selling, general and administration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;advertisement is one of the greatest costs incurred by corporations today and is incorporated within the income statement. Moreover, you need to distribute your product to make it available to customers. This would lead to distribution costs, typically included in the sales and marketing expense line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;research and development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cell phone companies, for example, must continuously innovate to remain competitive and therefore have high research and development costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conversely, companies such as Coca-cola do not have extensive research and development costs; this is because they already have a sustainable advantage through a product that has been sold for decades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general and administrative expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the labour cost related to the operation of its machines is directly associated with production and therefore is a part of the cost of revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the salary of white-collar managers involved in running the company is not attributed to the cost of production - instead, it is attributable to an overhead expense that’s rolled into the G&amp;#x26;A (General and Administrative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;corporations are likely to window-dress the general and administrative expenses shown in corporate income statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;other operating expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refer to all the overhead costs that cannot be categorized into the major lines the company has selected to represent, such as management salaries, depreciation, rent, marketing, advertising costs, costs for research into new products, operating leases and IT, etc… Think of it as a catchall category for any miscellaneous expense reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;operating expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;summation of all secondary expenses incurred in the business’s running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a summation of all the secondary expenses gives the investor an overview of how efficiently the company has allocated overhead costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;income from operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compare this (income from operations) to the net interest income/expenses to gain an understanding of interest obligations (or debt payments).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the basis of the organization is to produce goods and services to maximize profitability. Profitability will only be maximized when the business is able to control its operating expenses while maximizing its revenue. The operating income is an efficiency indicator, and the operating margin indicates the business’s ability to generate a profit from a given level of sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;net interest income/expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka financial items or other income/expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the most appropriate name for this would be net interest income/expense since this line is most influenced by financing impacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interest expense is the cost of servicing debt incurred by the organization when it takes on debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies use debt as a financing source while keeping money in the bank to provide flexibility for their daily operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the company would need to set up a sunk account (on the balance sheet) to set aside money each year to pay back the principal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remember that this line is not only financial items but also other revenue and expenses that are not part of the company’s daily operations. It could be income generated from other resources like renting out specific areas of the property. It could also relate to multinational companies with widespread operations that are likely to be impacted by foreign exchange risk adjustments in either a positive or negative manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;extraordinary income/expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extraordinary is not part of the daily operations and cannot be predicted. For example, a loss incurred from a lawsuit is very hard to predict. It can be categorized as a one-time event or maybe restructuring charges like closing down a subsidiary, merging two divisions, or personnel receiving severance pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When trying to determine a business’s true cash flow, many investors exclude extraordinary income in their model. That said, many conservative analysts will include average extraordinary expenses (for example, the average annual expense over five years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;income taxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tax is a huge expense for any company, and just as you would instead invest in a company with an efficient R&amp;#x26;D department, you would also rather invest in a company with a lower tax rate. You should look for the effective tax rate over time and not a single snapshot in time. The important thing is understanding a company’s tax trends. Look for consistencies - and when you don’t find them, understand why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;net income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka profit for the year or net income from continued operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gross profit margin ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gross profit margin ratio = gross profit / revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;indicate how efficient companies are at controlling costs and a good starting point to compare with a competitor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;operating margin ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operating margin ratio = income from operations/revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not only when the cost of revenue, such as sugar and tin cans, are sold, but secondary expenses like administration, distribution and all the other costs related to Coca-Cola’s daily business are deducted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;net income margin ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net income margin ratio = net income / revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is the money that the investors made in profit compared to the money the business collected for selling every product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trend analysis is the heart of understanding the prospects for future performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interest coverage ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;important ratio for minimizing the risk and it shows the reality of a company’s ability to keep its head above water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interest coverage ratio = income from operations/interest expense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a rule of thumb, I like to see a stable interest coverage ratio of at least five times the operating income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cash generated from operations reflects the ability of the organization to generate cash from its core business operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our starting point for the cash flow from operating activities is the net income (the bottom line on the income statement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some line items within the income statement do not result in an inflow or outflow of cash and, therefore, must be added or deducted to the net income starting point of the cash flow statement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the only cash flow representing a stable and predictable earnings capacity is obtained from operating activities. The other two increases involve selling an asset (the house) and taking on debt (the car loan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you look at five years trend of a company’s cash flow statement, nothing spells trouble faster than a company that continually raises cash outside of the company’s operating activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;net income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so this is our starting point. This number is from the bottom of the income statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from this point, we need to adjust for all non-cash items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depreciation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also called depreciation and amortization. Other times, it is grouped into a line called non-cash items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depreciation is a non-cash item, meaning no cash is spent. As such, you should add back the depreciation for the later years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depreciation is subtracted from the income statement but added to the cash flow statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;other non-cash items&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an example for Coca-Cola could be the income or expense from the exchange rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe extraordinary income and losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deferred taxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deferred taxes occur when there are temporary differences between the accounting value and tax value of assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it impacts how much cash is going in and out of the company - which is why deferred taxes are included in the cash flow statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;changes in working capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working capital is about current assets and liabilities needed to run the business’s daily operations.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if working capital is $-832, that means that $832 less is tied up in the business’s daily operations than the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working capital is expensive, so we want to limit it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cash-generated-from-investing-activities&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#cash-generated-from-investing-activities&quot; aria-label=&quot;cash generated from investing activities permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cash generated from investing activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in contrast to the operating cash, we want the cash flow from investing activities to be negative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an analysis of cash flow from investing activities reveals the growth strategy pursued by the corporation. Any cash outlay from investing activities has the long-term goal of increasing the company’s future cash flow. In the following years, the purchase of more assets should produce a larger operating cash flow, which in turn will pay for more investments at a later date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;property, plant and equipment - net&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this line is sometimes referred to as Capital expenditures, cap spending, or simply CAPEX.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, you should be cautious when you see a positive number for this line. While cash may be nice today, companies may find themselves short-handed if the funds aren’t used to purchase more valuable assets or expensive service debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;intangible assets - net&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for example, Coca-Cola might patent a new soft drinks recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you will most likely find this line to be negative too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;businesses - net&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in general, Warren Buffett believes that companies should stick to their core activities. In the case of Coca-Cola, this means that the company should focus on the beverage industry and not buy businesses in other sectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;investments - net&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managers typically get into trouble with purchasing investments when they cross the threshold of passive ownership and move into a controlling share of the business they don’t understand. It means that the company would be responsible for overall management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cash-generated-from-financing-activities&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#cash-generated-from-financing-activities&quot; aria-label=&quot;cash generated from financing activities permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cash generated from financing activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;included activities such as dividends, debt, issuances of stocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;issuances of stock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When this is a positive number, the company issues more common stock to raise money. When this is a negative number, The company buys back shares from the open market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can sometimes be combined with the following line “purchase of stock for the treasury.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a stock issue should be treated the same way as a perpetuity loan (or never-ending loan).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by looking up a company’s current P/BV ratio and its current ROE, you can get a general idea of the effective perpetuity interest rate the original shareholders are assuming for the issuance of the new stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let’s say you need to raise a million dollars for a new building. You could get the money from the bank at a 7.5% interest rate for ten years. Second, you could issue bonds at an 8.5% interest rate for ten years. Third, you could issue more company shares to raise money. Issuing more shares would lead to an effective interest rate of 5.22%. Now the caveat: issuing shares should be treated as a perpetuity loan, whereas the other choices would only last for ten years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;purchases of stock for treasury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you find this line to be negative, it means that the company is buying back its stocks. Once repurchased, the stock no longer has voting rights or entitlements to receive dividend payments. It is said to be held in treasury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a company buys back shares, the existing shareholders will increase their relative ownership. The critical issue is that management bought back the share with the shareholders’ existing money. In other words, the management of Coca-Cola increased your ownership with your own money. That money could be paid to you as a dividend, or the management could employ it by investing in the new income-producing asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since the company uses the owners’ money to buy back shares, a share repurchase is only more profitable for the shareholder at a reasonable price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;payment of cash dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;management prefers a share buy-back because they don’t pay taxes on the disbursement, and they retain capital in the company to make future acquisitions or purchases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a company’s payout ratio (dividend rate/EPS) is higher than 50%-60%, the company might be inhibiting their ability over the long haul to pay owners and still meet the demands of the company’s competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;issuances/payment of a debt - net&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the best way to raise capital is to make enough profit, so the company doesn’t need to borrow any money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the debt-equity ratio exceeds 0.5, you’ll probably want to understand how the company got there and what it’s doing to reduce its position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if this line is negative, the company is paying off its debts. The company has taken on new debt (or issued bonds) if the number is positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if you notice that a company’s operating cash flow is negative and this issuance/payment of debt is positive, you’re looking at a company in serious trouble.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;free cash flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free cash flow = operating cash flow + property, plant and equipment, net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at a minimum, I would look at the 5-year average to try and determine the FCF for the intrinsic value calculation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the free cash flow can be paid out to the shareholders as dividends, it can be returned in the form of share buy-backs, and it can be used to pay off the company’s debt. It is cash that flows back to the shareholders in one way or the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;free cash flow to revenue ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free cash flow to revenue ratio = (operating cash flow + property plant and equipment net) / Revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it means that for every Coca-Cola that sells soft drinks for $100, $13.2 will be available as cash for the shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in general, you should be looking for companies that have a consistent free-cash-flow-to-revenue ratio of at least 5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;investing cash flow to operating cash flow ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investing cash flow to operating cash flow ratio = investing cash flow / operating cash flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it means every time Coca-Cola makes $100 in cash from its operations, $53.3 in cash is spent on maintaining and investing in the company’s growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the short term, high investment ratios should not be a problem. Indeed, it might be over 100% in some years if the investment possibilities are great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the long run, Warren Buffett understands the importance of reinvesting capital into the business. Still, at the same time, he firmly believes cash should ultimately be returned to the shareholders in some profitable form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the balance sheet is sectionalized into three major categories: the assets, the equity and the liabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;assets&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#assets&quot; aria-label=&quot;assets permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;assets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assets are what the company owns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assets can be financed in 2 ways: with the company’s money, called equity, or with someone else’s money, which is called liabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because assets are financed by equity or liabilities, the two sides will always be equal. They will balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;assets are something that is owned and expected to generate income for the company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 different categories of assets: the non-current and the current assets
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current asset can be defined as any asset which is likely to be converted into cash within a period of 1 year such as cash, inventory and receivables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-current assets are sometimes referred to as long-term assets. An organization includes those assets that have an expected ownership over a period exceeding one year and cannot immediately be converted into cash, such as machines for production, buildings, cards, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the idea of distinguishing various kinds of assets is to present to the reader an accurate and fair view of a company’s financial condition, which is also why the balance sheet is sometimes referred to as the statement of financial position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-assets&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#current-assets&quot; aria-label=&quot;current assets permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Current assets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cash and cash equivalents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. When we think of cash, it includes any cash kept in a register and safely stored in a bank account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cash equivalents are equal to having cash that is currently in a different form, for example, money market funds, saving deposits and deposit certificates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accounts receivables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka receivables, net receivables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most of a business’s sales tend to be carried out on credit instead of cash. This payment is an asset for the company because it will be turned into cash later. Typically, this would happen within 60-90 days. This also means that receivables, in reality, are interest-free loans provided from one company to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most often, it is made up of the credit sales of goods and services, but it can also contain expected current payments such as interest on various securities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in short, this is money that is expected to flow into the company but is yet to be received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inventory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;typically, inventory is subdivided into three categories: raw materials (such as sugar for coca-cola), work in progress (such as labour costs for managing machines), and finished goods (includes costs for packaging the products).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;other current assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any current assets that do not meet any of the three previous categories (may include property, plant and equipment available for sale or any asset that is expected to be sold within the year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;might also include derivatives designated as hedging instruments, such as foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts (to minimize risk and exposure to a flexible and unpredictable market).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prepaid expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a firm sometimes pays off some of its expenses before it actually incurs them (such as distribution rights in advance for 6 months in the case of coca-cola)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the prepaid expenses tend to be the most illiquid item in the current assets category. Most likely the contractual terms would not allow Coca-Cola to ask for such a reversal of funds that have already been paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that’s why you’ll find prepaid expenses listed at the very bottom of the current assets column; it’s the “thickest” and most difficult to turn back into cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;total current assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;summation of all assets that you expect to turn into cash during the next 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;assets that will not turn into cash within the next 12 months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non-current receivables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The money is expected to be paid back, but not within the next 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non-current investments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;referred to as long-term investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes a company is involved in long-term investments in an attempt to generate income from non-operating assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as an investor, you’re right to question why a company should have long-term investments. You might argue that a company with a high number of investments would tend to concentrate less on core activities. That is typically a bad sign. Conversely, investments such as these might signify a diversification policy so earnings are maintained despite changes in external environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;property, plant, and equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ranging from buildings to property and manufacturing equipment to mere office furniture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very often, some of the largest expenses for a company are related to this category of assets. Tangible assets will often have to be replaced, and that’s a very expensive bill that has to be paid
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think of a company like Hilton Resorts. They will constantly have building upgrades and interior remodelling expenses to remain competitive in their market. Ultimately, all bills end up being paid by the company’s shareholders. That is why we only want PE that can produce revenue, not PPE, for owning a lot of assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;patents, trademarks and other intangibles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies with strong brand names and efficient research and development departments are likely to carry trademarks and patents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;due to accounting law, a company can list all expenses from research and development as an intangible asset. This means that all the material and labour costs Coca-Cola incurs to produce the recipe can now be transformed into an asset. (it could also mean that if Coca-Cola has inefficient personnel and high salaries, this would ultimately be transformed into a bigger asset). This process is called capitalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capitalization is how intangibles like patents and trademarks are entered into the balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intangible assets lose value if it is deemed that they cannot generate income. When intangible assets are depreciated, it’s called amortization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since patents and trademarks provide a durable competitive advantage for a company, it is a great source of risk reduction. Additionally, intangible assets are generally unaffected by inflation. This means that as time marches on, the value of patents and trademarks increases in nominal dollars automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;goodwill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;goodwill only occurs during the acquisition process; it is not something that the company can create by themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;liabilities&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#liabilities&quot; aria-label=&quot;liabilities permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Liabilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accounts payable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes referred to as payables, net payables, or trade payables since this category primarily summarizes what the business has bought on credit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for a company, it’s very neat to have an interest-free loan in less than 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;notes payable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes referred to as current borrowing or the current financial debt. It represents how much outstanding short-term debt should be paid back to the issuer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accrued expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;often, companies will incur expenses that are not yet paid for. For Coca-Cola, this could be expenses for employees’ salaries, electricity bills, or any payment that is consumed but not yet paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any portion of the bill that has not been paid at the balance sheet date would be classified as accrued expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;taxes payable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in corporate accounting, the company is responsible for withholding the taxes it owes - it doesn’t happen automatically. Taxes payable are a holding pattern for corporate taxes. This is the account where the company will list the money they owe to the federal, state, or local government for the products or services they sell. Once the payment is made to the government from the cash account, you’ll see a deduction in the taxes payable account, and the tax payment will then be listed on the income statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes, non-current liabilities are referred to as long-term liabilities, which the company expects to pay outside the 12-month timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;long-term debt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when Coca-Cola obtains loans, creditors do not influence the daily operations. Daily business decisions are usually entirely up to the management and shareholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perhaps, surprisingly, long-term debt does not always have to be paid back.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for example, if you have a mortgage of $300000, there is no good reason to pay back your whole loan, especially if the interest rate is under the inflation rate. As long as you feel you have sufficient equity in your home, you should be fine using your money for something else. The bank is usually pleased to receive interest payments on your home if you do not default on the payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let’s say that Coca-Cola takes on a little debt at an interest rate of 4%. As long as Coca-Cola can make a better return in the market and control the risk, it may choose to delay the repayment of the principal to seek larger returns elsewhere. If the company decides to pay off the loan, it would be similar to getting a 4% return (accounting for inflation, it might even be as low as 1% effectively). An efficient company could probably get a better return by investing in new assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look into the interest coverage and debt-to-equity ratios to gauge if the debt is controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deferred tax&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it can be listed as an asset or a liability depending on what year a particular item is being depreciated and what the company has decided to realize as a loss or gain.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for example, a deferred tax occurs when there is a difference between the linear and accelerated depreciation approach. In essence, the tax liability corrects the amount of taxes a company should or shouldn’t have paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deferred tax is only applicable for the year of consideration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once this asset is realized on the income statement, the amount listed on the balance sheet will disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;provisions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a company sells on credit, they expect some customers to default from time to time. For this reason, companies have a provisions account where they continually put money aside to absorb these potential losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the provisions account fluctuates yearly and will likely be adjusted continually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;when you own a share, you own a part of a real company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity is a form of liability. It is what the company owes to the owners of the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the shareholders of Coca-Cola who own all the company’s assets.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka capital stock, common stock, or paid-in capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is used to keep track of common stock splits and outstanding shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a company is originally started, the founder(s) place a certain amount of money into an equity account called &lt;em&gt;paid-in capital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regardless of the initial designation of how much one share’s par value is, the share capital account is a tracking tool for future splits and share growth/contraction.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let’s say the company decided to issue 200 more shares after initially issuing 100. The shares might sell on the open market for $500, raising money for the company, but that doesn’t preclude the company from tracking the new number of shares in the capital account. At the end of this action, there would be $200 in the capital account, and 200 shares would be outstanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let’s say the company wanted to conduct a stock split. The company intends to reduce the market price of each share. The capital account would remain the same, but the par value per share would be half.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most capital accounts use a penny or less to represent each outstanding share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional paid-in capital is, therefore, the difference between the proceeds for the stock issue subtracted by the par value.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the retained earnings are the sum of all the previous net incomes the company has produced.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of Coca-Cola, the capital is re-employed by the company to create even more money in the future.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the price the company paid to buy back its shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a good indicator of how much the company has been able to grow the owners’ money. Suppose a substantial growth in the treasury account occurred during the assessment period. In that case, it may drastically increase the book value growth, which can be used to measure free cash flow.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return on equity = net income / equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a gauge of a corporation’s profitability and how efficiently it generates those profits. The higher the ROE, the better a company is at converting its equity financing into profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;target ROE that is equal to or just above the average for the company’s sector&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return on assets = net income /total assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re buying a company with a low debt/equity ratio (like 0.50 or less), you can probably skip this calculation. On the other hand, if you’re buying a company with a lot of debt, you’ll probably want to use the ROA instead of the ROE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to see a ROA above 6%, but most importantly, I want to see that my stock picks have better ROA than their competitors.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a calculation used to assess a company’s efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a company is thought to be creating value if its ROIC exceeds its weighted average cost of capital (WACC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROIC = (net operating profit after tax)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it tells nothing about what segment of the business is generating value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invested capital is the total amount of money a company raises by issuing securities - the sum of the company’s equity, debt and capital lease obligations. Invested capital is not a line item in the company’s financial statement because debt, capital leases, and stockholder’s equity are each listed separately on the balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;current ratio = current assets / current liabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as investors, our threshold for a current ratio is that it should be above 1.0 or even 1.5 to be safe.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;as a shareholder of Coca-Cola, I would prefer to have the inventory empty and filled 4 times instead of 2.15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In all circumstances, capital in inventory is expensive, and for products with somewhat high duration, I would like to see an inventory turnover of 4 or above. I would need to do more research to understand the industry standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;note: it’s very important to remember that this number is compared to an annual income statement. If you were working with a quarterly income statement, you would need to multiply the number by 4 in order to ascertain the prorated annual turnover rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accounts receivable turnover ratio = turn over / accounts receivables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn over is actually the revenues of the business found on the income statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turnover days = 365 / accounts receivable turnover ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this means that once Coca-Cola makes a sale, it typically takes x days for them to receive payment from their customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is heavily dependent on the industry of the company and prefers the ratio around 5-7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;accounts-payable-turnover-ratio&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#accounts-payable-turnover-ratio&quot; aria-label=&quot;accounts payable turnover ratio permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;accounts payable turnover ratio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accounts payable turnover ratio = cost of revenue/accounts payable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn over days = 365 / accounts payable turnover ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this means that on average it takes Coca-Cola x days to replay their supplier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a ratio of between 2 - 6 is typically a sign of an efficient company that is satisfying bargaining power and, at the same time, having no problem paying its obligations to suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acid test ratio is a conservative approach to the current ratio. It is also called the skeptic liquidity measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acid Test Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt-to-equity ratio = (long term debt + notes payable) / equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term debt and notes payable include interest expenses that you need to pay on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it means that every time the shareholders own $100 in equity, they also owe $20.2 in debt that Coca-Cola is paying interest on (it’s 20.2% debt-to-equity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in general, Warren Buffet does not like to have a debt-to-equity ratio of above 0.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liabilities to equity ratio = total liabilities / equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with a ratio of 47.2, it means that every time the shareholder has $100 in equity, the company would have to pay out 47.2 at some point in the future. The liabilities include money Coca-Cola has borrowed from the bank and is paying interest on and is included just as much as the sugar that Coca-Cola has bought on credit from a supplier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more conservative value investors like to look at this key ratio instead of the debt-to-equity ratio. They do like to distinguish between interest-bearing debt, which is the most expensive and interest-free liabilities such as accounts payable. As a rule of thumb, the liabilities to equity ratio should be below 0.8 to be considered low-risk&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg-led5YMlo&amp;#x26;ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor&quot;&gt;swedish investor summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some financial manipulations, or shenanigans, are benign and may not hurt anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shenanigans that inflate profits are of most significant concern, followed by those that hide expenses or shift revenue from one time period to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all financial shenanigans are illegal, nor do they necessarily violate generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarterly financial reports are not independently audited. However, it is highly unlikely a company will be caught manipulating unaudited reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only a small fraction of companies fraudulently distort their financial reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapidly growing firms that suddenly face a slowdown may be tempted to cheat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporting bogus revenue can destroy a company’s reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CEO fixated on making “the numbers” at any cost is an investor’s nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal auditors should report directly to the Board of Directors’ audit committee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SEC should have the authority to bar or suspend corporate executives and board members who become involved in fraudulent financial reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;when to be on the lookout&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a company operates in a weak oversight environment, with a closely held board of directors or without a competent, independent auditor, you have a reason for concern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If management faces excessive competitive pressure, that should draw your attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If executives are known, for whatever reason, to be of dubious character or integrity, you have reason to wonder if that lack of integrity has crept over into other areas of the company’s business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If any of these indicators occurs in a previously high-flying company where growth is starting to slow, be especially wary and on the lookout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, be cautious about inner doings at basket-case companies struggling to stay alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;audit your auditor&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The auditors spend weeks reviewing a company’s financial records, so they spend some time reading their opinions. The opinion letter will usually give a clear view. That is, it will give the report a stamp of approval. If the auditors have severe reservations about the accuracy and fairness of a company’s financial statement, they will usually qualify the report. A company that receives a qualified opinion should raise the hackles on an investor’s back - especially if the qualification notes any “going concern.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, look out for a situation where no audit committee exists or the audit committee is comprised of less-than-independent members. The audit committee’s purpose is to act as a go-between, mediating between the outside auditor and the executives. Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange are required to have audit committees. No similar requirement binds most other publicly traded companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;catching the crooks&lt;/strong&gt;
How do you find out when a company is scamming you? Screening the integrity of financial reports is more accessible now, thanks to several Internet databases that equip you to check for signs of wrongdoing. Some sites focus more on the numbers, while others help you investigate a company’s footnotes, management discussions and news releases. The most widely used commercial database is Compustat, a product sold by Standard &amp;#x26; Poor’s, a division of McGraw-Hill. Factset Corporation sells another database
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With these tools, you can run a filter for companies showing the sharpest decline in operational cash flow as a percentage of net income. Or you can list companies that experienced the largest year-to-year sales growth followed by declining or negative growth. You can also seek the most significant increase in inventory compared to sales. Other things you can look for include an extensive deterioration in gross margins, a big jump in soft assets or a significant increase in deferred revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;buying trouble&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquisitions are fertile ground for chicanery. Many companies seek to buy other companies to rapidly accelerate their growth, a strategy with many risks for investors. Several tricks related to acquisitions can be used to help cover up the underlying ill health of the purchasing company. These gimmicks include taking large write-offs before or after the acquisition, shifting losses from the deal to another period and releasing the reserves that may be created through large write-offs. Be concerned when a firm uses very aggressive acquisition behaviour in a way that might make its sales look better than they are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the lessons of Enron&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the lessons of Enron is to be wary when a company makes a drastic change in how it does business. This is especially the case when a company is transitioning from an easily understood model, such as acquiring gas pipelines, to a model that is far more difficult to assess, such as trading on future energy contracts. Other warning signs included using special-purpose entities (SPEs), that is, off-the-books facilities that could be used to hide either profits or liabilities. Red flags should have been flapping because Enron did not provide detailed disclosure about the purpose of the SPEs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounting’s two fraudulent strategies are to either inflate or deflate earnings.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first can be accomplished by reporting an unduly considerable current period revenue or underestimating current period expenses. Manipulating either side of the ledger will work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second, the less intuitive strategy, involves deflating or underestimating earnings. Why would anyone want to do that? If you underestimate your financial performance, you can shift payments to a later timeframe when you need them to cover shortfalls. Essentially you minimize current profits to inflate future profits, thereby making the company appear to perform better than it does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies manipulate financial statements for three reasons:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is easy&lt;/strong&gt; – After all, managers check various options to select their firms’ accounting methods. Managers with integrity review the options available to find a reporting method that most closely reflects the company’s performance. Unscrupulous executives see the choices as an opportunity to take advantage of the system. Management is free to structure transactions or to announce reporting moves to promote the achievement of its accounting goals. For example, when using an operating lease approach, they can use lease agreements to keep debt off the books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can pay off handsomely&lt;/strong&gt; – Bonuses are often tied to a company’s financial profiles, so managers have a vested interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The chances of getting caught are slim&lt;/strong&gt; – Those who think they’ll get away with it are often correct. For instance, a company’s quarterly financial statements are unaudited and usually are not reviewed by an independent CPA. When an unaudited financial report is manipulated, it is doubtful that the company will be caught.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When evaluating the validity of a company’s reporting, be aware of misguided management incentives. These are not at all uncommon. Basing bonuses and stock options heavily on financial statement measurements create a temptation to cheat. Too much emphasis on the bottom line can cause observers to question the validity of a firm’s numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA) has defined 30 techniques, grouped into seven categories, that represent the ways that unethical companies dupe investors
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording bogus revenue&lt;/strong&gt; – This is the cardinal sin of accounting, and it can be accomplished in more ways than you might think. For example, some sales may appear to be significant, but they lack actual economic substance. Cash received in lending transactions can be recorded cleverly as revenue. Similarly, a company may try to record investment income as operating revenue. Another nasty trick is to count as revenue the rebates from suppliers that the company will receive on future purchases. And finally, a company may release revenue that it improperly held back in the first place, perhaps before a merger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording poor-quality revenue&lt;/strong&gt; – All revenue is not equal. For example, revenue for services that have not yet been provided is poor revenue and shouldn’t be counted. Revenue should never be recorded before the item sold has shipped and been accepted by the customer. A company should not record revenue if the customer isn’t required to pay. Sales to an affiliated company are also dubious. Grossing up revenue is another way to “cook the books.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-time gains&lt;/strong&gt; – Occasionally, a company will sell assets or make an investment windfall and count that as revenue. The problem is that this is only a one-time gain. Similarly, a one-time payment can make operating expenses appear less. Another dirty little trick is reclassifying accounts on the balance sheet to create apparent income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failing to report future liabilities accurately&lt;/strong&gt; – One way a company can put lipstick on the pig is to fail to record an obligation or otherwise move to reduce the list of liabilities improperly. Of course, owing less money makes a company look more profitable. This can be achieved by changing accounting assumptions, allowing reserves to be suddenly counted as income or creating phony rebates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expense-shifting&lt;/strong&gt; – If you can stretch current expenses out so that they fall into a later reporting period, the results will appear to be better than they are. This includes reducing reserves, failing to write off impaired assets or taking too long to amortize expenses. Or, you could change accounting policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Income-shifting&lt;/strong&gt; – Manipulation can also occur by shifting current revenue to a later period. This is sometimes achieved by creating a reserve account and then eliminating it later on when the money is needed. Also, companies occasionally hold back income before an acquisition deal closes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special charges&lt;/strong&gt; – Even more subtle is the business of shifting future costs to the current period as a special charge. Inflating the amount of a particular charge, writing off R &amp;#x26; D costs related to an acquisition and accelerating discretionary expenses are a few of the trade tricks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can be done to ensure there is no Enron recurrence? Many parties must be involved in changing the way things work. Those who determine and interpret laws and set professional standards must establish clear parameters for proper financial accounting and reporting standards. Internal auditors should report directly to the audit committees of their boards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission, set up after the stock market crash of 1929 to supervise the nature and accuracy of information provided to investors, should be given explicit legal authority to suspend or bar any corporate executive, director or board involved in financial misdealings. Management must set the proper tone and cannot emphasize reaching its numbers above everything else. Companies should be required to have auditors review their quarterly financial statements before they are released to the public. Auditors should be held more accountable for detecting fraud during an audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the SEC, the NASD and the NYSE combined to commission a study recommending ways to strengthen the audit committee function. The blue-ribbon panel determined that board directors must engage in active, independent oversight. The notion that a seat on a board is a reward for having “made it” in business should be replaced by an operational responsibility to guide the company forward. The audit committee has to be the main body responsible for driving the organization’s acceptance of proper accounting practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps financial shenanigans can never be eliminated. But specific steps can and must be taken to restore corporate credibility. Auditor training should emphasize the ability to detect accounting tricks and manipulations. Training should also be improved for those who rely on financial reports, including investors. The incentives to manipulate the numbers built into executive compensation packages should be re-evaluated. Investors, auditors and regulators have a much better chance of minimizing the damage that corporate dishonesty causes once they understand how dishonest companies pull off financial shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;price is what you pay, value is what you get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accounting is the language of business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Financial shenanigans are actions that intentionally distort a company’s reported financial performance and financial condition. They range from benign (changes in accounting estimates) to egregious (fraudulent recognition of bogus revenue).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In general, shenanigans that inflate revenue should be considered more serious than those that affect expenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A compensation structure that heavily emphasizes the bottom line creates an environment that sometimes encourages accounting chicanery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…management may have little difficulty distorting financial reports if the company has weak internal controls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When companies face troubled times because of business slowdowns and other setbacks, their managers frequently take certain (bookkeeping) steps to ensure that the sun will come out tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Special charges offer a wonderful opportunity to artificially boost future operating profits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite the efforts of rule makers, internal and independent auditors, regulators and others working in harmony to prevent, detect and eliminate financial shenanigans, the problem continues to exist and is not likely to disappear any time soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors should be wary whenever a company dramatically changes its business model, particularly from one easily understood by investors to another, far more obtuse and difficult to evaluate and monitor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concrete, repeatable techniques that can be employed to improve applications
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strive for simplicity, focus on smells, concentrate on difference, take small steps, follow the flocking rules, refactoring under green, fix easy problem first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;following the horizontal path means writing code to produce every kind of verse before diverging onto tangents to DRY out small bits of code that the verses have in common. The goal is to quickly maximize the number of whole examples before extracting abstractions from their parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in addition, deal with new requirements by first refactoring existing code to be open to them and then writing new code to meet them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you should not reach for abstractions, but instead you should resist them until they absolutely insist upon being created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing code is the process of working your way to the next stable end point, not the end point itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your goal is to write straightforward code, these metrics (ABC metrics) point you toward &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Shameless Green&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;getting insight into potential expense of code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how difficult was it to write?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how hard is it to understand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how expensive will it be to change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;terminology: method vs sending messages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “method” is defined on an object and contains behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “message” is sent to an object to invoke behavior
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;song() { verses(); }&lt;/code&gt; means that song method sends the verses message to the receiver this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore, &lt;strong&gt;method are defined, and messages are sent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“sending messages” are preferred to “call a method/function” as it implicitly encourage to create message senders that are willfully ignorant of implementation details, and fosters independence between senders and receivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;code is easy to understand when it clearly reflects the problem it’s solving, and thus openly exposes that problem’s domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;speculatively general and concretely abstract were both written with an eye toward reducing future costs, and it is distressing to see good intentions fail so spectacularly. &lt;strong&gt;The failure here is not bad intention - it’s insufficient patience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;there’s far more code here  than is needed to pass the tests. This unnecessary code took time to write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the many levels of indirection are confusing. You could study this code for a long time without discerning why they are needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you may feel compelled to understand its purpose before making changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the rule to determine which verse should be sung next? buried deep within the NoMore lambda is a hard-coded “99,” which might cause one to infer that verse 99 follows verse 0.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“DRY makes sense when it reduces the cost of change more than it increases the cost of understanding the code”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DRYing out code is not free. It adds a level of indirection, and layers of indirection make the details of what’s happening harder to understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marina-ferreira/99_bottles_of_oop/blob/main/chapter_1/03_concretely_abstract.rb&quot;&gt;concretely abstract code&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it clearly took a fair amount of thought and time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the individual methods are easy to understand, it’s tough to get a sense of the entire song. The parts doesn’t seem to add up to the whole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;while changing the code inside any individual method is cheap, in many cases, one simple change will cascade and force many other changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the rule to determine which verse should be sung next? Ditto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shameless green is defined as the solution that quickly reaches green while prioritizing understandability over changeability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it doesn’t dispute that DRY is good, rather, it believes that it is cheaper to manage temporary duplication than recover from incorrect abstractions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was easy to write and understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will be cheap to change. Even though the verse strings are duplicated, if one verse changes it’s easy to keep the others in sync.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the rule to determine which verse should be sung next? This is still not explicit. The 0 verse contains a deeply buried, hard-coded 99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for context/concrete guidance of what the code trying to accomplish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;any pile of code can be made to work; good code not only works, but it also simple, understandable, expressive and changeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can think of metrics as crowd-sourced opinions about the quality of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;measuring programmer productivity by counting lines of code (SLOC))
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easily garnered and reproduced, it reflects code volume but suffers from many flaws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclomatic complexity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an algorithm that counts the number of unique execution paths through a body of source code. The more deeply nested conditionals, the higher Cyclomatic complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code with fewer nested conditionals (lower cyclomatic complexity) is easier to reason with and maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can be used to limit the overall complexity. You can set standards for how high a score you’re willing to accept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can use it to determine if you’ave written enough tests, as it tells you the minimum number of tests needed to cover all the logic in the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assignments, branches and conditions (ABC) metrics
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assignments is a count of variable assignments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;branches counts not branches of an if statement but branches of control, meaning function calls or message sends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conditions counts conditional logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABC scores reflect cognitive load as opposed to physical size. High ABC numbers indicate code that takes up a lot of mental space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t do&lt;/strong&gt; big upfront design (BUFD)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;designs in BUFD cannot possibly be correct as many things will change during the act of programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BUFD inevitable leads to an adversarial relationship between customers and programmers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make design decisions only when you must with the information you have at that time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;postpone decisions until you are absolutely forced to make them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any decision you make in advance on an explicit requirement is just a guess. Preserve your ability to make a decision later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metrics are not direct indicators of quality but are proxies for a deeper measurement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate software metric would be cost per feature over time interval that matters, but this is not easy to calculate. Cost, feature, and time are individually difficult to define, track and measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your goal is to write software with the lowest cost per feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you decision about how much design to do depends on 2 things: your skills and your time frame.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a tradeoff between the amount of time spent designing and the amount of time this design saves in the future (and there is a break-even point).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the act of design prevents software from being delivered on time, you have lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;while it is important to consider the problem and sketch out an overall plan before writing the first test, don’t over think it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can’t figure out what’s right until you write some tests. The purpose of some of your tests might very well be to prove that they represent bad ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code should have the following qualities
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transparent
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the consequences of change should be obvious in the code that is changing and in distant code that relies upon it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reasonable
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small changes in requirements require correspondingly small changes in code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes has no unexpected side effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usable
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;existing code should be usable in new and unexpected contexts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exemplary
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code itself should encourage those who change it to perpetuate these qualities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2013/05/27/TheTransformationPriorityPremise.html&quot;&gt;transformation priority premise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if you choose the tests and implementations that employ transformations that are higher on the list, you will avoid the impasse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the code go through a sequence of transformation from &lt;strong&gt;specific to generic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when passing a test, prefer higher priority transformations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when posing a test choose one that can be passed with higher priority transformations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when an implementation seems to require a low priority transformation, backtrack to see if there is a simpler test to pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{} -&gt; nil&lt;/code&gt; no code at all -&gt; code that employs nil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as we write the first test &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wrapNullEmptyString()&lt;/code&gt;, we also write the failing implementation which also employs &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;({} -&gt; nil)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nil-&gt;constant&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can make the first test pass by return empty string, which apply &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nil-&gt;constant&lt;/code&gt; transformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(constant-&gt;constant+)&lt;/code&gt;: a simple constant to a more complex constant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can then write the next test that employs &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(constant-&gt;constant+)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;oneShortWordDoesNotWrap() { assertThat(wrap(&quot;word&quot;, 5), is(&quot;word&quot;)) }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(unconditional-&gt;if)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(constant-&gt;scalar)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variable is a generalization of constants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;oneShortWordDoesNotWrap&lt;/code&gt; test pass by using both &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(unconditional-&gt;if)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(constant-&gt;scalar)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;as tests get more specific, code should become more generic&lt;/strong&gt;. Code become more generic by becoming more abstract. One way to make code more abstract is to DRY it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DRY is important but if applied too early, and with too much vigour, it can do more harm than good. It’s a good idea to ask the following questions when doing so:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the change I’m contemplating make the code harder to understand? Be suspicious of any change that muddles the waters?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what is the future cost of doing nothing now?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some changes cost the same regardless of whether you make them now or delay them until later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if it doesn’t increase your costs, delay making changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when will the future arrive, or how soon will I get more information?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s better to tolerate duplication than to anticipate the wrong abstraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing shameless green means optimising for understandability, not changeability, and patiently tolerating duplication if doing so will help reveal the underlying abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;duplication is useful when it supplies independent, specific examples of a general concept that you don’t yet understand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the goal is to use green to maximize your understanding of the problem and to unearth all available information before committing to abstractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the new code muddles rather than clarifies the waters, and it’s important to understand why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green Bar patterns:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fake it (“Till you make it”)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developing habits of writing just enough code to pass the tests forces you to write better tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it also provides an antidote for the hubris of thinking you know what’s right when you’re actually wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obvious implementation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s best to save obvious implementation for very small leaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;triangulate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires writing several tests at once, which means you’ll have multiple simultaneous broken tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the idea is to write one bit of code which makes all of the tests pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;triangulation is meant to force you to converge upon the correct abstraction in your code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the small steps of TDD act to incrementally review the correct implementation, &lt;strong&gt;skipping these incremental steps means you miss the opportunity of being set right&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is song method needed?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;answering this question requires thinking about the problem from the message sender point of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knowledge that one object has about another creates a dependency. Dependencies tie objects together, exacerbating the ost of change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using verses method to request the entire song, however, requires significantly more knowledge. the sender must know
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name of hte verses method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the method requires 2 arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the first argument is the verse on which to start&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the second argument is the verse on which to end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the song starts on verse 99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the song ends on verse 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are many ways in which the verses method could change that would break senders of this message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveal the intention
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the distinction between intention and implementation … allows you to understand a computation first in essence and later, if necessary, in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;song is the intention, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;verses(99,0)&lt;/code&gt; is the implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;programmers who are hyper-alert to duplication, might be tempted to test &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;song&lt;/code&gt; like this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_the_whole_song&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  bottles &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Bottles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
  assert_equal bottles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;verses&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; bottles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;song
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this test has a major flaw that can cause it toggle from “short and sweet” to “painful and costly” in the blink of an eye. This flaw lies dormant until something changes, so the benefits of writing tests like this accrue to the writer today, while the costs are paid by the unfortunate maintainer in the future.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the test is coupled to the implementation details of song such that it will break if the signature or behavior of verses changes, even if song continues to return the correct lyrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you change an implementation detail while retaining existing behaviour and are then confronted with a sea of unrelated red tests, you’re right to be exasperated. &lt;strong&gt;This is completely avoidable, and a sign that tests are too tightly coupled to code. Such tests impede change and increase costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;song&lt;/code&gt; test should know nothing about how the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Bottles&lt;/code&gt; class produces the song. The clear and unambiguous expectation here is that the song return the complete set of lyrics, and the best way and easiest way to do that is to assert that it does:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_the_whole_song&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  expected &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal heredoc-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;SONG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;

  bottles &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Bottles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
  assert_equal expected&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; bottles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;song
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you find the duplication distressing, consider the alternatives. Your choices are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assert that the expected output matches that of some other method.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests are coupled to the implementation, so these dependencies mean changes to the system under test might break the tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assert that the expected output matches a dynamically generated string.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reducing string duplication inside the test would require logic. Regardless of how you do it, any logic here would bind the tests to implementation details and any change to the system under test might break the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assert that the expected output matches a hard-coded string.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not only is the expected output clearly and unambiguously stated, but the test has no dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deferring design decisions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intentionally depending on interfaces allows you to use tests to put off design decision safely and without penalty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supporting abstractions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests are your record of the interface of every abstraction. They let you put off design decisions and create abstractions to any useful depth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exposing design flaws
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a test requires painful setup, the code expects too much context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the test is hard to write, other objects will find the code difficult to reuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good tests not only tell a story, but they lead, step by step, to a well-organised solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;test are not a place for abstractions, they are the place for concretions. Abstractions belong to the code&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with objects as if they are only and exactly the messages to which they respond lets you design a changeable application, and it is your understanding of the importance of this perspective that allows you to create tests that provide maximum benefit at minimum cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests should concentrate on the incoming or outgoing messages that cross an object’s boundaries. The incoming messages make up the public interface of hte receiving object. The outgoing messages, by definition, are incoming into other objects and so ar part of some other object’s interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the general rule is that objects should make assertions about state only for messages in their own public interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some outgoing messages have no side effects and thus matter only to their senders.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;outgoing messages like this are known as queries and they need not be tested by the sending object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;query messages are part of the public interface of their receiver, which already implements every necessary test of state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many outgoing messages do have side effects (a file gets written, a database record is saved, an action is taken by an observer) upon which your application depends.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proving that a message gets sent is a test of behavior, not state, and involves assertions about the number of times, and with what arguments, the message is sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incoming messages should be tested for the state they return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you understand the costs and benefits, feel free to choose any framework that suits you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BDD takes an outside-in approach, creating objects at the boundary of an application and working its way inward, mocking as necessary to supply as-yet-unwritten objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD takes an inside-out approach, usually staring with tests of domain objects and then reusing these newly created domain objects in the tests of adjacent layers of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you tests know more about the internal inside of the object under test, it allows knowledge that should be private eto the object leak into the tests, increasing coupling between them and raising the likelihood that changes the code will require changes in tests.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;incoming messages ought to have dependents. Some object other than the original implementer depends on each of these messages.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;if Wheels are expensive to create, the Gear test pays that cost even though it has no interests in Wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an application constructed of tightly coupled, dependent laden objects is like a tapestry where pulling on one thread drags the entire rug along.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;running Gear test would then create a large network of objects, any of which might break in a maddeningly confusing way.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;when you can’t test object in isolation, it bodes ill for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the diameter method is part of hte public interface of a role, one that might reasonably be named diameterizable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thinking of the injected object as a instance of its role gives you more choices about what kind of Diameterizable to inject into Gear during your tests.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the whole point of dependency injection is that it allows you to substitute different concrete classes without changing existing code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object-oriented design tells you to inject dependencies because it believes that specific concrete classes will vary more than these roles, or conversely, roles will be more stable than the classes from which they were abstracted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your application contains many different diameterizables, you might want to create an idealized one so your tests clearly convey the idea of this role.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if all diameterizables are expensive, you may want to fake a cheap one to make your tests run faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are doing BDD, your application might not yet contain any object that plays this role; you may be forced to manufacture something just to write the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;when diameterizable’s interface changes from diameter to width, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Wheel&lt;/code&gt; get updated but &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gear&lt;/code&gt; does not
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since the dimeterizabledouble is injected, the test continues to pass even though the application is definitely broken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is where the stubbing and mocking could make the tests brittle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“when interface of a role changes, all players of the role must adopt the new interface”, dynamic language like ruby doesn’t complain about the incompatible implementation with the interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;injecting the same objects at test time as are used at runtime ensures that tests break correctly but may lead to long running tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;injecting doubles can speed tests but leaves them vulnerable to constructing a fantasy world where tests work but the application fails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you can’t get/access the structure you need, then the tests tell you that it’s time to break up the class into more minor/composable features.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the extracted methods form the core of responsibilities of the new object and so make up its public interface, which is (theoretically) stable and thus safe to depend upon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests of private methods are therefore coupled to application code that is likely to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since tests provide documentation about the object under test, it could mislead others into using them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never write private methods, and if you do, never ever test them, unless of course it makes sense to do so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;outgoing messages are either queries or commands. Query messages matter only to the object that sends them, while command messages have effects that are visible to other objects in your application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignoring query messages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s redundant for Gear to duplicate correctness tests from Wheel, maintainance costs will increase if it does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proving command messages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes, it does matter that the message get sent and the object under test is responsible for sending the message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your tests must prove that the command messages got sent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you have proactively injected dependencies, you can easily substitute mocks. Setting expectations on these mocks allows you to prove that the object under test fulfills its responsibilities without duplicating assertions that belong else where&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using role tests to validate doubles
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the point of view of the object under test, every other object is a role, and dealing with objects as if they representative of the roles they play loosens coupling and increases flexibility, both in your application and in your tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you fear that human communication will be insufficient to keep all players of a role in sync, write the tests.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;prove that all objects in this hierarchy honor their contract

&lt;li&gt;confirming subclass behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;confirming superclass enforcement
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bicycle&lt;/code&gt; class should raise an error if a subclass does not implement &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;default_tire_size&lt;/code&gt;. Even though this requirement applies to subclasses, the actual enforcement behavior is in Bicycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_forces_subclasses_to_implement_default_tire_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testing concrete subclass behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s important to test these specializations without embedding knowledge of the superclass into the test.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RoadBikeTest&lt;/code&gt; should ensure that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;local_spares&lt;/code&gt; works while maintaining deliberate ignorance about the existance of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;spares&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testing abstract super class behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can stub the behavior that would normally be supplied by subclasses (follow liskov substitution principle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be especially careful when testing subclass specializations to prevent knowledge of the superclass from leaking down into the subclass’s test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;if the problem is solved, and you choose to refactor now rather than later, you pay the opportunity cost of not being able to work on other problems
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spending time “improving” code based purely on aesthetics may not be the best use of your precious time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need for change imposes higher standards on the affected code. &lt;strong&gt;Code that never changes obviously doesn’t need to be changable, but once a new requirement arrives, the bar is raised&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;code is open to a new requirement when you can meet the new requirement without changing the existing code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;when faced with a new requirement, first rearrange the existing code such that it’s open to the new feature, and once that’s complete, then add the new code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the trick to successfully improving code that contains many flaws is to isolate and correct them one at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are unclear about how to make it open, the way forward is to start removing code smells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you should never change tests during a refactoring, if your tests are flawed such that they interfere with refactoring, improve them first, and then refactor&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rules
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select the things that are most alike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find the smallest difference between them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the simplest change that will remove that difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as you follow the flocking rules
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change only 1 line at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run the tests after every change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the tests fail, undo and make a better change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes to code can be subdivided into 4 distinct steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parse the new code: confirm the syntax is valid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parse/execute step: proving that code runs without blowing up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parse/execute and use its result: ensure that it returns the correct result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete unused code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Flocking&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the group’s behavior is the result of a continuous series of small decisions being made by each participating individual. These decisions are guided by three simple rules
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alignment - steer towards the average heading of neighbors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separation - don’t get too close to a neighbor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cohesion - steer towards the average position of the flock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the “flocking rules” for code allow abstractions to appear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making existing code open to a new requirement often requires identifying and naming abstractions. The flocking rules concentrate on turning difference into sameness, and thus are useful tools for unearthing abstractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;converging-on-abstractions&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#converging-on-abstractions&quot; aria-label=&quot;converging on abstractions permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;converging on abstractions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focusing on difference
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DRYing out sameness has some value, but DRYing out difference has more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encapsulating the concept that varies, a theme of many design patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;difference holds the key to understanding. If 2 concrete examples represent the same abstraction and they contain a difference, that difference must represent a smaller abstraction with a larger one. if you can name the difference, you’ve identified that smaller abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simplifying a hard problem
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many programmers gravitate towards starting a problem at its most confusing part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solving easy problems, through a magical alchemy of code, sometimes transmutes hard problems into easy ones. It is common to find that hard problems are hard only because the easy ones have not yet been solved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;naming concepts
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;general rule and new requirement can help in the struggle for a name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name you choose will be the name you use in conversations with your customers. Naming things after domain concepts improves communication between you and the folks who pay the bills. Only good can come of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notice the following difference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token command-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token command string&quot;&gt;`${number -1} bottle of bear on the wall.\n`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token command-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token command string&quot;&gt;`${number -1} bottles of beer on the wall.\n`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;- what the words &quot;bottle&quot; and &quot;bottles&quot; represent in the context of the song?
  - within the context of song, &quot;bottle/bottles&quot; does not represent pluralization.
  - the new requirement involve with the need to say &quot;six pack&quot; instead of &quot;bottle/bottles&quot;. The string &quot;six pack&quot; is one more concrete example of the underlying abstraction.
  - the general rule is that the name of a thing should be one level of abstraction higher than the thing itself. The strings &quot;bottle/bottles/six-pack&quot; are instances of some category, and the task is to name that category using language of the domain
  - one way to identify category is to imagine the concrete examples as rows and columns in a spreadsheet
  - the header &quot;number&quot; is a level of abstract higher than the concrete examples. &quot;1&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; are numbers
  - container is meaningful, understandable and unambiguous.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;xxx?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bottle&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;six-pack&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;n&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bottles&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#follow-the-flocking-rules&quot;&gt;follow the flock rule&lt;/a&gt; example
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add new container method with 1 line return &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bottles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replace the first client code to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;container()&lt;/code&gt; method instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bottles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add parameter argument &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expand the code in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;container&lt;/code&gt; to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; to decide which of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bottle&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bottles&lt;/code&gt; to return
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;could be expressed in ternary form as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number === 1? &quot;bottle&quot;: &quot;bottles&quot; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change other references to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;container&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a class &lt;strong&gt;must have data and behavior (methods)&lt;/strong&gt;. If one of these is missing, the code doesn’t belong to a class.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rephrase every one of its methods as a question, asking the question ought to make sense.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Please Mr. Gear, what is your ratio?” - makes sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Please Mr. Gear, what is your tire size?” - Doesn’t make sense = does not belong here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe the class in 1 sentence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;class should do the smallest possible useful thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the description contains the words “and” or “or”, it means that the class has more than one responsibility
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gear’s responsibility: “calculate the effect that a gear has on a bicycle”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depend on behavior (methods), not data&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never call @variables inside methods, use wrapper methods instead
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/serodriguez68/poodr-notes/blob/master/code_examples/chapter_2.rb#L61-**L71**&quot;&gt;wrong code example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/serodriguez68/poodr-notes/blob/master/code_examples/chapter_2.rb#L73-L102&quot;&gt;right code example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data very often has behavior that you don’t yet know about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hide data structures&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the class uses complex data structures, write wrapper methods that decipher the structure and depend on those methods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/serodriguez68/poodr-notes/blob/master/code_examples/chapter_2.rb#L105-L117&quot;&gt;wrong code example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it trades indexing into a structure for sending messages to an object. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wheelify&lt;/code&gt; method above isolates the messy structural information and DRYs out the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extract extra responsibilities from methods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;methods with single responsibility have these benefits
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clarify what hte class does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid the need for comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourage reuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to move to another class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask questions about what they do and try to describe their responsibilities in a single sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separating iteration from the action that’s being performed on each element (common case of single responsibility in methods)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t decide; preserve your ability to make a decision later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concentrate on the primary class. Decide on its responsibilities and enforce your decision fiercely. If you identify extra responsibilities that you cannot yet remove, isolate them. Do not allow extraneous responsibilities to leak into your class
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;good public interface structure
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;objects reveals as little of themselves as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;objects know as little of their neighbors as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Result: plugable, component-like objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveals the class’s primary responsibility
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the public interface should correspond to the class’s responsibility. A single responsibility may require multiple public methods. However, too many loosely related public methods can be a sign of single responsibility violation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are expected to be invoked by others&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;focus on messages, not domain objects (classes)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you don’t send messages because you have objects, you have objects because you send message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design experts notice domain objects without concentrating on them; they focus not on these objects but on the messages that pass between them. These messages are guides that lead you to discover other objects, ones that are just as necessary but far less obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Using sequence diagram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lightweight way of acquiring a design intention about an interaction. It provides a simple way to experiment with different object arrangements and message passing schemes between objects. It brings clarity to your thoughts and provide a vehicle to collaborate and communicate with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;should this receiver be responsible for responding to this message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I need to send this message, who should respond to it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: asking for “what” instead of telling “how”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: trusting other objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

It is exactly what &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; wants. The problem is not with the sender, it is with the receiver. You have not yet identified an object whose responsibility it is to implement this method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sequence diagram keep the focus on messages and allow you to form a rational intention about the first thing to assert in a test. Switching your attention from objects to messages allows you to concentrate on designing an application built upon public interfaces&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create test for public interfaces.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not test private methods. If you must, segregate those test from the ones of the public methods&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your design forces the use of a private method in another class, re-think your design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dependency on a private method of an external framework is a form of technical debt&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;define a new well-defined method for that class’ public interface.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you simultaneously change many things and something breaks, you’re forced to understand everything in order to fix anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making a slew of simultaneous changes is not refactoring - it’s rehacktoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gradual cutover refactoring
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a strategy for keeping the code in a releasable state by gradually switching over a small number of pieces at a time. This type of refactoring can be done alongside other development work without affecting the release schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let red be your guide. If you take a giant step and the tests begin to fail, undo and fall back to making smaller changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;real refactoring is comfortingly predictable, and saves brainpower for more thought provoking challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the non-default branch is implemented first, the default has to be set to something that actually meets the condition and so makes the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; branch execute.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, implementing the non-default branch first places a slightly greater burden on you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seeking stable landing points
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code is read many more times than it is written, so anything that increases understandability lowers costs. Next, and just as important, consistent code enables future refactorings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taking bigger steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you take bigger steps and the tests begin to fail, there’s something about the problem that you don’t understand, if this happens, don’t push forward and refactor under red. Undo, return to green, and make incremental changes until you regain clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discovering deeper abstractions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;successor&lt;/code&gt; is important, and separating it from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;quantity&lt;/code&gt; gives both methods a single responsibility if you conflate &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;choosing-what-to-sing-for-any-number(quantity)&lt;/code&gt; with deciding-what-verse-to-sing-next(successor), the resulting method would be harder to understand, future refactorings would be more difficult, and attempts to change the code for 1 idea might accidentally break it for other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the challenge is identifying the current concept and coming up with a good name.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It must represent a smaller abstraction within that larger one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;names should neither be too general nor too specific. For example, thing is too broad, and ItOrOne too narrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when perfect name for a concept is elusive, there are couple strategies moving forward
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time box 5 - 10 minutes to ponder, and then use the best name that you can come up with (usually with thesaurus in hand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instantly choose a meaningless name like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;. Like there is no point wasting time thinking about it now, the name will be obvious later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can ask someone else, like fellow programmers or customers for help.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;deriving names from responsibilities
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus on the difference and find abstraction one level higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when creating an abstraction, first describe its responsibility as you understand it at the moment, then choose a name which reflects the responsibility. The effort you put into selecting good names right now pays off by making it easier to recognize perfect names later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every piece of knowledge is a dependency, and the way that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;quantity&lt;/code&gt; is written requires verse to know too many things. If &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;quantity&lt;/code&gt; were more trustworthy, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;verse&lt;/code&gt; could know less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the idea of reducing the number of dependencies imposed upon message senders by requiring the receivers return trustworthy objects is a generalization of the Liskov Substitution Principle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liskov, in plain terms, requires that objects be what they promise they are. When using inheritance, you must be able to freely substitute an instance of a subclass for an instance of its superclass. Subclasses, by definitions, are all their superclasses, plus more, so this substitution should always work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liskov violations force message senders to have knowledge of the various return types, and to either treat them differently or convert them into something consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abstraction provide name for the consolidated code, allowing the name to be as a shortcut for an idea, independent of its current implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the abstractions tell you where your code relies upon an idea. But to get this benefit, you must refer to an abstraction in every place where it applies.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appreciating immutability
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;immutable objects are easy to understand and to reason about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because they are easy to reason about, immutable objects are also easy to test. Tests for immutable objects avoid extra setup, which makes the tests cheaper to write and easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another key virtue of immutable objects is that they are thread safe. You can’t break shared state if shared state doesn’t change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the best programming strategy is to write the simplest code possible and measure its performance once you’re done. If the whole is not acceptably fast, profile the performance, and speed up the slowest parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your goal is to optimize for easy of understanding while maintaining performane that’s fast enough. Don’t sacrifice readability before having solid performance data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the truth about refactoring is that it sometimes makes things worse, in which case your efforts serve gallantly to disprove an idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s entirely possible that you do not yet know what change will make it open. At this point, you must decide whether it’s better to proceed with additional modifications to teh code, or better to revert the previous change and take a different tack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you must continue to be guided by code smells, and doing so requires that you identify the smells in the current code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;superfluous differences raises the cost of reading code, and increases the difficulty of future refactorings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identifying patterns in code
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one way to get better at identifying smells is to practice describing the characteristics/patterns of code. Including any patterns that you see, and things you like, hate, or don’t understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the following questions draw attention to a number of interesting characteristics of the code as it’s written so far:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do any method have the same shape?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do any method take an argument of the same name?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do argument of the same name always mean the same thing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you were going to break this class into 2 pieces, where’s the dividing line?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do the tests in the conditionals have any thing in common?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how many branches do the conditionals have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do the methods contain any code other than the conditional?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does each method depend more on the argument that got passed, or on the class as a whole?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these eight questions group certain methods together. The same-shaped, same kind of conditional testing, bottle number taking, argument-depending, flocked five methods fall into one group, and the song, verses, and verse methods into another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trust the process
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you adhere to a recipe and tests start failing, it’s likely that there’s something about the problem that you don’t yet understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insisting upon messages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as an oo practitioner, when you see a conditional, the hairs on your neck should stand up. You should feel entitled to send messages to objects. It means that objects are missing and suggests that subsequent refactorings are needed to reveal them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborators must be brought together in useful combinations, and assembling these combinations requires knowing which objects are suitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s a big difference between a conditional that selects the correct object and one that supplies behavior. The first is acceptable and generally unavaidable. THe second suggests that you’re missing objects in your domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;squint test rule
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put the code of interest on your screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lean back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;squint your eyes such that you can still see the code, but can no longer read it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change in shape, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change in color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes in indentation reveal the presense of conditionals, the more nested level of conditionals, the more complexed/complicated the code site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes in color indicate difference in the level of abstraction. A method that intermixes many colors tells a story that will be difficult to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analyzing the “flocked five” (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;quantity&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;container&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;action&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pronoun&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;successor&lt;/code&gt;) using the above questions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do any methods have the same shape?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they all have the same shape according to squint tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do any methods take an argument of the same name?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yes, the flocked five methods take number as an argument and the arguments represent the bottle number rather than a verse number from the argument number of verse method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;having multiple methods that take the same argument (indicate duplicate concept, not duplicate name) is a code smell. In an ideal world, each different concept would have its own unique, precise name, and there would be no ambiguity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you were going to break this class into 2 pieces, where’s the dividing line?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after verse and before the flocked five methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do the tests in the conditionals have anything in common?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; to be exactly equal to another value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;testing for equality has several benefits over the alternatives. Most obviously, it narrows the range of things that meet condition. This reduces the difficulty of debugging errors. Testing of equality also makes the code more precise, and this precision enables future refactorings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how many branches do the conditionals have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do the methods contain any code other than the conditional?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do methods that take &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; as an argument depend more on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;, or more on the class as a whole?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primitive obsession&lt;/em&gt; is when you use one of the built-in data types to represent a concept in your domain. Obsessing on a primitive results in code that passes built-in types around and supplies behavior for them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s easy to imagine creating objects that stand in for things, but the power of OO is that it lets you model ideas, things that don’t physically exist. Modellable ideas often lie dormant in interactions between objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experienced OO programmers deftly create virtual worlds in which ideas are as real as physical things.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a mechanism for automatic message delegation. It defines a forwarding path for not-understood messages.???&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the problem that inheritance solves: highly related types that share common behavior but differ along some dimension (single class with several different but related types)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;here is a typical progression for problems that inheritance solves:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your code starts with a concrete class
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/serodriguez68/poodr-notes/blob/master/code_examples/chapter_6.rb#L2-L29&quot;&gt;example of a concrete bicycle class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Writing code is the process of working your way to the next stable end point, not the end point itself”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“DRY makes sense when it reduces the cost of change more than it increases the cost of understanding the code”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“metrics are fallible but human opinion is no more precise. Checking metrics regularly will keep you humble and improve your code”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“shameless green is defined as the solution that quickly reaches green while prioritizing understandability over changeability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it doesn’t dispute that DRY is good, rather, it believes that it is cheaper to manage temporary duplication than recover from incorrect abstractions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Quick green excuses all sins”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“good design preserves maximum flexibility at minimum cost by putting off decisions at every opportunity, deferring commitments until more specific requirements arrive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“think of an object oriented application as a series of messages between a set of black boxes”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the reason you’re writing tests is to save money, and every potential test must be evaluated against that criteria”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when your intention is to defer a design decision, do the simplest thing that solves today’s problem. Isolate the code behind the best interface you can conceive and hunker down and wait for more information”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the rules of thumb for testing private methods are: never write them, and if you do, never ever test them, unless of course it makes sense to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“making existing code open to a new requirement often requires identifying and naming abstractions. The flocking rules concentrate on turning difference into sameness, and thus are useful tools for unearthing abstractions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the best tests are loosely coupled to the underlying code and test everything once and in the proper place. They add value without increasing costs”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“only talk to your immediate neighbors”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Inheritance is for &lt;strong&gt;specialization&lt;/strong&gt;, NOT for sharing code”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“no matter how complicated the code, the receiving object ultimately handles any message in one of two ways. It either responds directly or it passes the message on to some other object for a response.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;practice TDD as a design technique and not only as a testing technique.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strangely, if we try to practise TDD as only a testing technique, then eventually we will become bored by our own defects and begin to notice “this code is annoying to test”, which points to design problems. After that, we’re practising TDD also as a design technique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software development as a learning process.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expose uncertainly early by testing our assumption as early as possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we use mock objects to identify the essential interactions between modules/objects. This leads to more effective abstractions, which reduces the cost of changing the software safely over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stub queries; expect actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write code that depends as little as possible on its context. It leads to more reusable code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;programming by intention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;test-driven-development-tdd-and-quality&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#test-driven-development-tdd-and-quality&quot; aria-label=&quot;test driven development tdd and quality permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Quality&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development as a learning process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best approach a team can take is to use empirical feedback to learn about the system and its use and then apply it back to the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development is incremental and iterative.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incremental development builds a system feature by feature. Each feature is implemented as an end-to-end slice. As a result, the system is continuously integrated and ready for deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A system is deployable when the acceptance tests all pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External quality&lt;/strong&gt; is how well the system meets the needs of its customer and users. It’s usually part of the contract to build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal quality&lt;/strong&gt; is how well the system meets the needs of its developers and administrators. The point of maintaining internal quality is to allow us to modify the system’s behaviour safely and predictably because it minimizes the risk that a change will force significant rework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running end-to-end tests tells us about the external quality. Writing them tells us something about how well we understand the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An object-oriented system: A web of collaborating objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Values vs objects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a value represents some fixed quantity or measurement, and it is immutable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an object, on the other hand, is an identity that might change state over time. It models a computational process or a stateful behaviour of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The communication between the objects can be seen through tests. So don’t try to model your system based on the entities (objects) alone, but on the communication between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objects follow common communication patterns. The domain model is in these communication patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An object is an implementation of one or more roles:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;roles are a set of related responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;responsibilities is an obligation to perform a task or know information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collaboration is an interaction of objects or roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An object communicates by messages: it receives messages from other objects. It reacts by sending messages to other objects as well, as perhaps, returning a value or exception to the original sender. An object has a method of handling every type of message that it understands. In most cases, it encapsulates some internal state that it uses to coordinate its communication with other objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the intention of every test clear: distinguish between the tested functionality, the supporting infrastructure, and the object structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;write unit tests for object behaviour rather than the object’s methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something that is difficult to test is probably poorly designed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The single responsibility principle
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;of the heuristic is that we should be able to describe what an object does without using any conjunction (“and,” “or”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interacting with the composite object should be more straightforward than interacting with the components that it composes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The empty interface is sometimes used to mark a domain concept and show how it’s used in collaboration. Later, as we grow the code, we fill in the interface with methods to describe its behaviour.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only mock types that you own:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t use mocks for third-party code since it is usually not changeable as you don’t have control over it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an adapter layer to implement interactions with third-party code. We test these adapters with focused integration tests to confirm our understanding of how the third-party API works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We must focus on integrating our design and the external code. In integration, we have an abstraction to implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we must check that we’re using the third-party API correctly and adjust our abstract to fit if we find that our assumptions are incorrect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some exceptions where mocking third-party libraries can be helpful:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we might use mocks to simulate behaviour that is hard to trigger with the library such as testing a sequence of calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use interfaces to name roles played by objects and describe the messages they’ll accept. Keep interfaces as narrow as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use interfaces to define the available messages between objects, but we also need to express their communication protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we use TDD with mock objects as a technique to make these communication protocols visible, as a tool for discovering them during development and as a description when revisiting the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD with mock objects also encourages information hiding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if similar interfaces represent different concepts, we can make a point of making them distinct.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decision to separate similar-looking interfaces is an excellent time to reconsider their naming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another time to consider refactoring interfaces is when we start implementing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To run an initial end-to-end test that fails is already a lot of work. However, deploying and testing right from the start of a project forces the team to understand how their system fits into the world. it flushes out the “unknown.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a drawing of the system’s structure on the whiteboard where it’s visible for the whole team, and keep it in mind while coding! Then, make the smallest number of decisions you can to kick-start the TDD cycle. Then, we’ll learn and improve from honest feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test as a walking skeleton
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a walking skeleton implements the thinnest possible slice of actual functionality that we can automatically build, deploy, and test end-to-end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including the deployment step in the testing process is critical for two reasons
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid the error-prone manual activity of deploying the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flush out the risks in operating the software (like six weeks and four signatures to set up a database, we want to know now, not two weeks before delivery.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;context of the first test
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand the problem -&gt; broad-brush design (architecture) -&gt; automate: build, deployment, end-to-end tests -&gt; deployable system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we have no guarantees that the decisions we’ve made about the design of our application are right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our ideal situation is where the team regularly releases a real production system. This allows the system’s stakeholders to respond to how well the system meets their needs, at the same time allowing us to judge its implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we use the automation of building and testing to give us feedback on the qualities of the system
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the automated deployment helps us frequently release to real users, which gives us feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the great benefit is that we will be able to make changes in response to whatever we learn from feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose uncertainty early by testing our assumptions as early as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the essential structure of a test:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating any required mock objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create any natural objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specify how you expect the mock objects to be called by the target object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call the triggering method on the target object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assert that any resulting values are valid and that all the expected calls have been made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start each feature with an acceptance test
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we write the acceptance using only terminology from the application’s domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the precision of expression requirements in a form that can be automatically checked helps us uncover implicit assumptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start testing with the simplest success case
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we find it helpful to keep a notepad or index card by the keyboard to jot down failure cases, refactorings, and other technical tasks that need to be addressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write the test that you’d want to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch the test fail
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when we get the right failure, we check that the diagnostics are helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We adjust the test code and rerun the tests until the error messages guide us to the problem with the code.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error message checks our assumptions about the code we’ve been working on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;emphasis on expressing our intentions is fundamental for developing reliable, maintainable systems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop from the inputs to the outputs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start developing the feature by considering the events that trigger the new behaviour in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will need to write one or more objects to handle these events. We discover that these objects need supporting services from the rest of the system. In this way, we work our way through the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;unit test behaviour, not methods&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one common mistake is thinking about testing methods. We do better when we focus on the object’s features under test should provide. It helps to choose test names that describe how the object behaves in the tested scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps to name the test by describing the required behaviour in a specific scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best we can get from the testing part of TDD is &lt;strong&gt;the confidence that we can change the code without breaking it. Fear kills progress. The trick is to make sure that the confidence is justified.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we grow our systems a slice of functionality at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we use two principle heuristics to guide this structuring:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separation of concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher levels of abstraction
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That’s why most people order food from a menu in terms of dishes, rather than the detail of the recipes used to create them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In its terminology, we write interfaces to describe its relationships with the outside world (Cockburn’s ports). Then we write bridges between the application core and each technical domain (Cockburn’s adapters). The bridges implement the interfaces defined by the application model and map between application-level and technical-level objects.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code for the business domain is isolated from its dependencies on technical infrastructures, such as databases and user interfaces. We don’t want technical concepts to leak into the application model, so we write interfaces to describe their relationships with the outside world in its terminology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encapsulation ensures that the behaviour of an object can only be effected through its API. Information hiding conceals how an object implements its functionality behind the abstraction of its API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we follow standard practices to maintain encapsulation when coding:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define immutable value types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid global variables and singletons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copy collections and mutable values when passing between objects, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t share a reference/pointer to a mutable object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t use global variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t use singletons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single responsibility principle: every object should have a single, clearly defined responsibility. We should describe what an object does without using any conjunctions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composite simpler than the sum of its parts,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the API of a composite object should not be more complicated than of any of its components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we grow the code, the composing more straightforward rules raise abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“One domain vocabulary” rule: don’t use a term from another domain’s vocabulary unless you’re a bridging layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiding the correct information. Encapsulation is almost always a good thing to do, but sometimes information can be hidden in the wrong place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an interface named Service and an implementation called ServiceImpl is probably a sign of bad design. The interface should be described in general domain language, and the implementation should have something specific about it to use in the name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;domain types are better than strings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when we take the trouble to express the domain clearly, we often find more options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This style produces more flexible code because it’s easy to swap objects with the same role. The caller sees nothing of their internal structure or the rest of the system behind the role interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When messages are trusting and ask for what the sender wants instead of telling receiver how to behave, objects naturally evolve public interfaces that are flexible and reusable in novel and unexpected ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we ask when
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting information from values and collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using a factory to create new objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;searching or filtering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can specify how we expect the target object to communicate with its mock for a triggering event -&gt; expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we can use the test to help us tease out the supporting roles our object needs, defined as Java interfaces, and fill in actual implementations as we develop the rest of the system -&gt; interface discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;only talk to your immediate neighbors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;certain “violations” of demeter reduce your application’s flexibility and maintainability, while others make perfect sense. Additionally, violations typically lead to objects that require lots of context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the definition “only use one dot” is not always right. There are cases that use multiple dots that do not violate Demeter
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;access distant attribute&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;customer.bicycle.wheel.tire&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it may be cheapest in your specific case to reach through intermediate objects than to go around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider moving behavior using that tire attribute to wheel object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;invokes distant behavior&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;customer.bicycle.wheel.rotate&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cost is high. This violation should be removed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hash.keys.sort.join(&apos;,&apos;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no violation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hash.keys.sort.join&lt;/code&gt; actually returns an Enumerable of Strings, all of the intermediate objects have the same type and there is no Demeter violation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delegation removes visible violations but ignores demeter’s spirit. Using delegation to hide tight coupling is not the same as decoupling code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;demeter violations are clues of missing objects whose public interface you have not yet discovered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you shift to a message-based perspective, the messages you find will become public interfaces in the objects they lead you to discover. However, if you are bound by the shackles of existing domain objects, you will end up assembling their existing public interfaces into long message chains and thus will miss the opportunity to find and construct flexible public interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define specific types to represent value concepts in the domain help:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to find all the code relevant for a change without having to chase through the method calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to reduce the risk of confusion, use a more object-oriented instead of scattering related behaviour across the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Breaking out”&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when an object becomes complex, that’s a sign that it’s implementing multiple concerns and that we can break out coherent units of behaviour into helper types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally is better to treat this code as a spike: once we know what to do, just roll it back and re-implement it cleanly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break up an object if it becomes too large to test easily or if its test failures become challenging to interpret. Then unit tests the new parts separately&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Budding off”&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when we want to mark a new domain concept in the code, we often introduce a placeholder type that wraps a single field. With each class that we add, we’re raising the level of abstraction of the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid adding new behaviour that doesn’t belong to an object, we can create an interface to define the service that the object needs from the object’s point of view. Then, we write tests for the new behaviour as if the service already exists, using mock objects to help describe the relationship between the target object and its new collaborator. We think of this as an on-demand design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The placeholder for a new object will be filled in with later implementation details. For example, when writing a test, we ask ourselves, “If this worked, who would know?”, if the correct answer to that question is not in the target object, it’s probably time to introduce a new collaborator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Bundling up”:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating a new object for a group of objects always used together. When the test for an object becomes too complicated to set up, […] consider bundling up some collaborating objects.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new object hides the complexity in an abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to give the new entity a name that helps us understand the domain better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can scope the dependencies more clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can be more precise with our unit testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peers that need to be kept up to date with the object’s activity. Notifications are “fire and forget.” Notifications are so helpful because they decouple objects from each other.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peers that adjust the object’s behaviour to the broader needs of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This includes policy objects that make decisions on the object’s behalf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partially creating an object and then finishing it off by setting properties is brittle because the programmer must remember to put all the dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notifications and adjustments can be passed to the constructor as a convenience. Alternatively, they can be initialized to safe defaults and overwritten later. For example, adjustments can be initialized to shared values and notifications to a null object or an empty collection. We then add methods to allow callers to change these default values and add or remove listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;compose objects to describe system behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD at the unit test level guides us to decompose our system into value types and loosely coupled computational objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can provide a description (the intention of the collaboration) of the expected calls for a test in a context by declaring the expectation of a mock object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The advantage of this approach is that we have a flexible application structure from relatively little code. It’s particularly suitable where the code has to support many related scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just assigning and linking objects doesn’t help us understand the system’s assembling behaviour. Instead, the information we care about is typically buried in a morass of keywords, setters, punctuation, and the like.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To battle with this, we can organize the code into two layers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;implementation layer&lt;/strong&gt;: graph of objects, its behaviour is the combined result of how its objects respond to events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The declarative layer
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is, in effect, a small domain-specific language embedded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the declarative layer that describes what the code will do. In contrast, the implementation layer defines how the code does it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The different purposes of the two layers mean that we use a different coding style for each. For the implementation layer, we stick to the conventional object-oriented style guidelines. For the declarative layer, we’re more flexible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;most of the time. Such a declarative layer merges from continual merciless refactoring. Taking care to notice when an area of code is not clear, we add or move structure until it is&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delegate to subordinate objects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;started writing the test we wanted to see and then filling in the supporting objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;start from a statement of the problem and see where it goes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the alternative is to write code directly in the tests and then refactor out any clusters of behaviours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;context-independence&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#context-independence&quot; aria-label=&quot;context independence permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Context independence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A system is easier to change if its objects are context-independent: each object has no built-in knowledge about the system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect of the context-independence rule on a system of objects is to make their relationships explicit, defined separately from the objects themselves. This simplifies the objects and manages the relationships&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’ just extract parameters on details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is big topic and it’s better to be covered as in separate &lt;a href=&quot;/manage-dependencies&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Golden Rule of TDD: Never write new functionality without a failing test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Object-oriented design focuses more on the communication between objects than on the objects themselves.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Objects make their decisions based only on the information they hold internally or that which came with the triggering message.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“break up an object if it becomes too large to test easily, or if its test failures become difficult to interpret. Then unit tests the new parts separately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When writing a test, we ask ourselves, “If this worked, who would know?”, if the right answer to that question is not in the target object, it’s probably time to introduce a new collaborator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the test for an object is too complicated to set up […] consider bundling up some of the collaborating objects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing forces us to understand a process better than trying to automate it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Expect unexpected changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each object should have no built-in knowledge about the system in which it executes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The big idea is `messaging’ … the key in the making great, and growable systems is much more to design how its modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and behaviours should be”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Iteration Zero in most agile projects, there’s a first stage where the team sets up its physical and technical environments. A common practice is to call this step iteration (the team still needs to time-box its activities) zero (before functional development starts in iteration one). One important task for iteration zero is to use the walking skeleton to test-drive the initial architecture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the legends say, if we have something’s true name, we can control it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the string is a stark data structure, and everywhere it is passed, there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we take the trouble to express the domain clearly, we often find that we have more options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“try to follow the four-step TDD cycle (fail, report (make the diagnostics clear), pass, refactor).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“test doubles are fine, but don’t stop there if you can invert the dependency and turn expectations into stubs… or even better, replace the stub with the value it returns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no broad tests are required. The test suite consists of “narrow” tests focused on specific concepts. Although wide integration tests can be added as a safety net, their failure indicates a gap in the main test suite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;easy refactoring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no magic. Tools that automatically remove busywork, such as dependency-injection and auto-mock frameworks, are not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a silver bullet. Design mistakes are inevitable, requiring continuous attention to design and refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;benefits from learning to listen to test smell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep knowledge local. The “magic” need to create mocks could cause the knowledge to leak between components.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if we can keep knowledge local to an object (either internal or passed in), then its implementation is independent of its context. So we can safely move it where we like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do this consistently, and your application, built out of pluggable components, will be easy to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it’s explicit, we can name it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid mocking concrete classes that can help us give names to the relationships between objects and the objects themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the legends say, if we have something’s true name, we can control it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if we can see it, we have a better chance of finding its other uses and reducing duplication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more names mean more domain information
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we find that when we emphasize how objects communicate rather than what they are, we end up with types and roles defined more in terms of domain than the implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we seem to get more domain vocabulary into the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This might be because we have a more significant number of smaller abstractions, which gets us further away from the underlying language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pass behaviour rather than data&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we find that by applying “Tell, Don’t Ask” consistently, we end up with a coding style where we tend to pass behaviour (in the form of callbacks) into the system instead of pulling values up through the call stack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this keeps the tests and the code clean as we go. It helps to ensure that we understand our domain and reduces the risk of being unable to cope when a new requirement triggers changes to the design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a unit test shouldn’t be 1000 lines long! It should focus on at most a few classes and should not need to create a large fixture or perform lots of preparation to get the objects into a state where the target feature can be exercised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from xUnit patterns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obscure Tests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;confuse the differences between test cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;single test case exercises multiple features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can’t skim-read the tests to understand the intention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uses magic numbers but are not clear about what, if anything, is significant about those values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests with lots of code for setting up and handling exceptions, which buries their essential logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mocking values
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mock value object means that we want to describe the behaviour of the interface explicitly, and we can’t think of a name for the concrete implementation of the interface/class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when there isn’t a good implementation name. It might mean that the interface is poorly named or designed. Perhaps it’s unfocused because it has too many responsibilities, or it’s named after its implementation rather than its role in the client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s a value, not an object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re tempted to mock a value because it’s too complicated to set up an instance, consider writing a builder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;partial mocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test diagnostics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mocking concrete classes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid override behaviour in testable subclass
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it leaves the relationship between objects implicit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we subclass, there’s nothing in the domain code to make such a relationship visible - just methods on an object. This makes it hard to see if the service that supports this relationship might be relevant elsewhere, and we’ll have to do the analysis again next time we work with the class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we mock a concrete class, we force client objects to depend on interfaces they do not use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, extract an interface as part of our test-driven development process. It will push us to think up a name to describe the relationship we’ve just discovered. This makes us think harder about the domain and teases out concepts we might otherwise miss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can’t get/access the structure you need, the tests tell you that it’s time to break up the class into more minor, composable features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bloated constructor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some arguments define a concept that should be packaged up and replaced with a new object to represent it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being sensitive to complexity in the tests can help us clarify our designs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for arguments always used together in a class and those with the same lifetime. Give it a good name to explain the concept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confused object
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too large because it has too many responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it would likely has a bloated constructor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another associated smell is that its test suite will look confused. The tests for its various features will have no relationship with each other. We cannot make significant changes in one area without touching others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too many dependencies
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dependencies should be passed into the constructor, but notifications and adjustments can be set to defaults and reconfigured later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialized the peers to standard defaults, the user can configure them later through the user interface, and we can configure them in our unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too many expectations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can’t tell what’s significant and what’s just there to get through the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can make our intentions clearer by distinguishing between stubs simulations of actual behaviour that help us get the test to pass and expectations, assertions we want to make about how an object interacts with its neighbours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow queries and expect commands
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commands are calls that are likely to have side effects, to change the world outside the target object. queries don’t change the world, so they can be called any number of times, including none&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rule helps to decouple the test from the tested object. So if the implementation changes, for example, to introduce caching or use a different algorithm, the test is still valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many expectations indicate that we’re trying to test too large a unit or locking down too many of the object’s interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;constructing complex test data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing persistence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests with threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing asynchronous code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seeding DB data everywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;magic injection of objects and data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overlapping sociable tests (constructing entire dependency chain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test brittleness
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the tests are too tightly coupled to unrelated parts of the system or irrelevant behaviour of the object(s) they’re testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests overspecify the expected behaviour of the target code, constraining it more than necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is duplication when multiple tests exercise the same production code behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;beware of flickering tests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a test can fail intermittently if its timeout is too close to the time the tested behaviour typically takes to run or if it doesn’t synchronize correctly with the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flickering tests can mask actual defects. We need to make sure that we understand what the real problem is before we ignore flickering tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;allow flickering tests is terrible for the team. It breaks the quality culture where things should “just work,” Even a few flickering tests can make the team stop paying attention to broken builds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it also breaks the habits of feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we should be paying attention to why the tests are flickering and whether that means improving the design of both the tests and code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runaway tests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be careful when an asynchronous test asserts that the system returns to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless it also asserts that the system enters an intermediate state before asserting the initial state, the test will run ahead of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lost updates
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a significant difference between tests that sample and those that listen for events is that polling can miss state changes that are later overwritten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the test can record notifications from the system, it can look through its records to find essential notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to be reliable, a sampling test must ensure that its system is stable before triggering any further interactions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid irrelevant information and make the cause-effect relationship between the fixture and verification logic clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test names describe features (high-level languages and abstractions)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think of one coherent feature per test, which might be represented by up to a handful of assertions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a single test seems to be making assertions about different features of a target object, it might be worth splitting up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a common approach is to name a test after the method it’s exercising
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at best, such names duplicate the information a developer could get just by looking at the target class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we don’t need to know that TargetObject has a “choose” method, &lt;strong&gt;we need to know what the object does in different situations, what the method is for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a better alternative is to name tests in terms of the target object’s features.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TestDox convention: Each test name reads like a sentence, with the target class as the implicit subject.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a List holds items in the other they were added: holdsItemsInTheOrderTheyWereAdded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the point of the convention is to encourage the developer to think about what the target object does, not what it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing the tests, some developers start with the test name first, and some begin to create a placeholder for the test names before writing any test codes. Both approaches work as long as the test is, in the end, consistent and expressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read documentation generated from tests (provide a fresh perspective on the test names, highlighting the problems we’re too close to the code to see)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arrange/act/assert structure is not clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write in order: test names/act/assert/arrange to help us focus on what to write and avoid being coupled to the low technical implementation details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasize the what over the how.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the more implementation detail is included in a test method, the harder it is for the reader to understand what’s important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use structure to explain and share
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jMock syntaxes are designed to allow developers to compose small features into a (more or less) readable description of an assertion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be careful in factoring out test structure, where the test becomes so abstract that we cannot see what it does anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our most significant concern is making the test describe what the target code does, so we refactor enough to see its flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accentuate the positive. Only catch exceptions in a test if we want to assert something about them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delegate to subordinate objects as mentioned in the programming by intention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assertions and expectations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the assertions and expectations of a test should communicate precisely what matters in the behaviour of the target code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid magic numbers with no clear cause-effect relationship.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;literal values without explanation can be difficult to understand because the programmer has to interpret whether a particular value is significant or just an arbitrary placeholder to trace behaviour (e.g. should be doubled and passed on to a peer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allocate literal values to variables and constants with names that describe their function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove duplication at the point of use
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change tests’ emphasis to what behaviour expected, rather than how the test is implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extract some of the behaviour into builder objects and end up with a declarative description of what the feature does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we’re nudging the test code towards the sort of language we could use when discussing the feature with someone else, even someone non-technical.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we push everything else into supporting code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;describe the intention of a feature, not just a sequence of steps to drive it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;using these techniques, we can use higher-level tests to communicate directly with non-technical stakeholders, such as business analysts. We can use the tests to help us narrow down exactly what a feature should do and why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other tools are designed to foster collaboration across the technical and non-technical members of a team, such as FIT, Cucumber.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid reasserting behaviour that is covered in other tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design to fail informatively: the point of a test is not to pass but to fail. If a failing test clearly explains what has failed and why we can quickly diagnose and correct the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we want to avoid situations when we can’t diagnose a test failure that has happened. The last thing we should have to do is crack open the debugger and step through the tested code to find the point of disagreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not too inhibited about dropping code and trying again. Sometimes, it’s quicker to roll back and restart with a clear head than to keep digging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the test is small, focused and has readable names, it should tell us most of what we need to know about what has gone wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explanatory assertion messages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the failure message should describe the cause rather than the symptom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highlight details with matchers. In addition, the matcher API includes support for describing the mismatched value to help with understanding precisely what is different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-describing value: build the detail into values in the assertion. If we add detail to an assertion, maybe that’s a hint that we could make the failure more obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;expected: &amp;lt;a customer account id&gt; but was &amp;lt;id not set&gt;
use new Date(timeValue) {public String toString() {return name; })
expected: &amp;lt;startDate&gt;, got &amp;lt;endDate&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obvious canned value
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conventions for common values can ensure that it stands out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tracer object
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dummy object that has no supported behaviour of its own, except to describe its role when something fails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jmock can accept a name when creating a mock object that will be used in failure reporting. However, where there’s more than one mock object of the same type, jMock insists that they are named to avoid confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explicitly assert that the expectation was satisfied.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A test with both expectations and assertions can produce a confusing failure. For example, this would create a failure report that says an incorrect calculation result rather than the missing collaboration that caused it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s essential to watch the test fails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it might be worth calling the assertIsSatisfied before any test assertions to get the right failure report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diagnostics are a first-class feature: try to follow four steps TDD cycle (fail, report (make the diagnostics clear), pass, refactor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the test is structured in terms of how other parts of the system represent the value, then it has a dependency on those parts and will break when they change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, mock the collaborator to return null if there’s no customer found.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first, we need to remember what’s null means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better, we could represent null with Maybe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if, instead, we’d given the tests their representation of “no customer found” as a single well-named constant instead of the literal null.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests should be written in terms of the information passed between objects, not of how that information is represented.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will make the tests more self-explanatory and shield them from changes in implementation controlled elsewhere in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus the assertions on just what’s relevant to the scenario being tested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid asserting values that aren’t driven by the test inputs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid reasserting the behaviour that is covered in other tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing for equality doesn’t scale well as the returned value becomes more complex. At the same time, comparing the total result each time is misleading and introduces an implicit dependency on the behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unit tests give us confidence that an object performs its synchronization responsibilities, such as locking its state or blocking and walking threads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coarser-grained tests, such as system tests, give us confidence that the entire system manages concurrency correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limitations of unit stress tests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is challenging to diagnose race conditions with a debugger, as stepping through code (or even adding print statements) will alter the thread scheduling causing the clash.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there may be scheduling differences between different os and processor combinations. Further, there may be other processes on a host that affect scheduling while the tests are running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run unit tests to check that our objects correctly synchronize concurrent threads and pinpoint synchronization failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run end-to-end tests to check that unit-level synchronization policies integrate across the entire system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We could also run static analysis tools as part of our automated build process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auction search is complicated because it needs to implement the search and notification functionality and the synchronization at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we want to separate the logic that splits a request into multiple tasks from the technical details of how those tasks are executed concurrently. So we pass a “task runner” into the AuctionSearch, which can then delegate managing tasks to the runner instead of starting threads itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concurrency is a system-wide concern that should be controlled outside the objects that need concurrent tasks.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the application can now easily adapt the object to the application’s threading policy without changing its implementation (“context independence” design principle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to run the tasks in the same thread as the test runner for testing instead of creating new task threads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;design stress test regard to aspects of an object’s observable behaviour that are independent of the number of threads calling into the object (observable invariants concerning concurrency)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write a stress test for the invariant that exercises the object multiple times from multiple threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch the test fail, and tune the stress test until it reliably fails on every test run; and,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make test the test pass by adding synchronization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, one invariant of our auctionSearch is that it notifies the consumer just once the search has finished, no matter how many Auction houses it searches or how many threads it starts.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stress testing passive objects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most objects don’t start threads themselves but have multiple threads “pass-through” them and alter their state. In such cases, an object must synchronize access to any state that might cause a race condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to stress-test the synchronization of a passive object, the test must start its threads to call the object. When all the threads have finished, the object’s state should be the same as if those calls had happened in sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synchronizing test thread with background threads
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid sleep/delay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use jMock’s Synchroniser for synchronizing between test and background threads, based on whether a state machine has entered or left a given state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;synchroniser&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;waitUtil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;searching&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;finished&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in an asynchronous test, the control returns to the test before the tested activity is complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An asynchronous test must wait for success and use timeouts to detect failure.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this implies every tested activity must have an observable effect: a test must affect the system so that its observable state becomes different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are two ways a test can observe the system: by sampling its observable state or listening for events that it sends out.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for example, auction sniper end-to-end tests sample the user interface for display changes through the window licker framework but listen for chat events in the fake auction server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make asynchronous tests detect success as quickly as possible to provide rapid feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put the timeout values in one place
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s a balance to be struck between a timeout that’s too short, which will make the tests unreliable, and one that’s too long, which will make failing tests too slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the timeout duration is defined in one place, it’s easy to find and change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scattering Adhoc sleeps and timeouts throughout the tests makes them challenging to understand because it leaves too much implementation detail in the tests themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capturing notifications
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an event-based assertion waits for an event by blocking a monitor until it gets notified or times out. When the monitor is notified, the test thread wakes up and finds that the scheduled event has arrived or is blocked again. If the test times out, then it raises a failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;polling for changes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sample-based assertion repeatedly samples some visible effect of the system through a “probe,” waiting for the probe to detect that the system has entered an expected state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are two aspects to the process of sampling: polling the system and failure reporting and probing the system for a given state.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing that an action has no effect
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if an asynchronous test waits for something not to happen, it cannot even be sure that the system has started before it checks the result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the test should trigger behaviour that is detectable and use that to detect that the system has stabilized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the skill here is in picking behaviour that will not interfere with the test’s assertions and will complete after the tested behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distinguish synchronizations and assertions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adopt a naming scheme to distinguish between synchronizations and assertions. For example, waitUntil() and assertEventually()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;externalize event sources
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hidden timers are complicated to work with because they make it hard to tell when the system is in a stable state for a test to make its assertions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only solution is to make the system deterministic by decoupling it from its scheduling.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can pull event generation out into a shared service-driven externally.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e., the system’s scheduler as a web service. System components schedule activities by making HTTP requests to the scheduler, triggering actions by making HTTP “postbacks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e., the scheduler published notifications onto a message bus topic that the components listened to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usually, introducing such an event infrastructure turns out to be useful for monitoring and administration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the trade-off is that our tests no longer exercise the entire system. We could also write a few slow tests, running in a separate build, that combine the whole design, including the real scheduler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contains several factory methods that create objects for use in tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mother object makes the test more readable by packaging up the code that creates new object structures and gives it a name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does not cope well with variation in the test data - every minor difference requires a new factory method.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most often used for values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the builder has “chainable” public methods for overwriting the values in its fields and, by convention, a build() method that is called last to create a new instance of the target object from the field values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests that need particular values within an object can specify just those values that are relevant and use defaults for the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep tests expressive and resilient to change
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wrap up most of the syntax noise when creating new objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the default case simple, and special cases not much more complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it protects the test against the changes in the structure of its object (like adding a new argument to the constructor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it helps easier to spot the errors because each builder method identifies the purpose of its parameter. (like new AddressBuilder().withStreet2(), make it obvious that street2 is passed in)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create similar objects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can initialize a single builder with the common state and then, for each object to be built, define the differing values and call its build() method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combining builders
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasizes the important information, what is being built, rather than the mechanics of building it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passing around the builders can remove much of the noise of calling build method.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anOrder().fromCustomer(aCustomer().withAddress(anAddress().withNoPostcode()))).build()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support logging: the messages are intended to be tracked by support staff and perhaps system administrators and operators to diagnose a failure or monitor the progress of the running system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diagnostic logging (debug and trace) is infrastructure for programmers. These messages should not be turned on in production because they’re intended to help the programmers understand what’s happening inside the system they’re developing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;domain probe: enables us to add observability to the domain logic while still talking in the language of the domain

&lt;li&gt;support.notifyFiltering(tracker, location, filter);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we’re writing code in terms of our intent (helping the support people, instrumentation) rather than implementation (logging), so it’s more expressive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s easiest to test code that doesn’t depend on Infrastructure (external systems such as databases, file systems, and services). However, a typical layered architecture puts infrastructure at the bottom of the dependency chain: Application/UI -&gt; Logic -&gt; infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, structure your application so that Infrastructure and Logic are peers under the application layer, with no dependencies between Infrastructure and Logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;infrastructure &amp;#x3C;- application/UI -&gt; logic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logic sandwich
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The infrastructure and logic layers can’t communicate with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;infrastructure.writeData(logic.processInput(infrastructure.readData()))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;traffic cop
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use observer pattern to send events from infrastructure to the application layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful not to let your traffic cop turn into a god class.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving some logic code into the infrastructure layer can simplify the overall design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;splitting the application layer into multiple classes, each with its own Logic Sandwich  or simple traffic cop, can help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when logic code has infrastructure dependencies. The code will be difficult to test or resist refactoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refactor problem code into a miniature A-Frame architecture. Start at the lowest levels of your logic layer and choose a single method that depends on one clearly-defined piece of infrastructure.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the infrastructure code is intertwingled with the Logic code, dis-intertwingled it by factoring out an infrastructure wrapper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The method will act similarly to an application layer class: it will have a mix of logic and calls to infrastructure. Make this code easier to refactor by rewriting its tests to use Nullable Infrastructure dependencies instead of mocks. Then factor all the logic code into methods with no infrastructure dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, your original method will have nothing left but a small “Logic Sandwich: a call or 2 to the infrastructure class and a call to the new logic method. Now eliminate the original method by inlining it to its callers’. This will cause the logic sandwich to climb one step up your dependency chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At that point, review its design and refactor as desired to better fit the “Logic Patterns” and your application’s needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climbing the ladder takes a lot of time and effort, so do it gradually, as part of your regular work, rather than all at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus your efforts on code where testing without mocks will have noticeable benefits. Don’t waste time refactoring code that’s already easy to maintain, regardless of whether it uses mocks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logic layer computation can only be tested if the computation results are visible to tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefer pure functions where possible. Pure functions’ return values are determined only by their input parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where pure functions aren’t possible, choose immutable objects. The state of immutable objects is determined when the object is constructed and never changes afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid writing code that explicitly depends on (or changes) the state of dependencies more than one level deep. Instead, design dependencies, so they encapsulate entirely their next-level-down dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;avoid getter/setter for objects, move any behaviour that uses getter/setter into the objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd party code doesn’t always have easily visible behaviour. It also introduces breaking API changes with new releases or simply stops being maintained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrap third-party code in the code that you control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the wrapper’s API to match the needs of your application, not the third-party code, and add methods as needed to provide easily visible behaviour. &lt;strong&gt;This typically involves writing query methods to expose deeply-buries state in terms of the domain that your application needs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the third-party code introduces a breaking change, or needs to be replaced, modify the wrapper, so no other code is affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frameworks and libraries with sprawling API(s) are more difficult to wrap, so prefer libraries that have a narrowly-defined purpose and a simple API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the third-party code interfaces with an external system, use an &lt;a href=&quot;#infrastructure-wrappers&quot;&gt;Infrastructure Wrapper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for each external system - service, database, file system, or even environment variables, create one wrapper class responsible for interfacing with that system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design your wrappers to provide a crisp, clean view of the messy outside world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design your infrastructure classes to stand alone in whatever format is most beneficial to the Logic and Application layers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test your external communication against a production-like environment. For file system code, check that it reads and writes actual files. For databases and services, access an entire database or service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run your focused integration tests against test systems that are reserved exclusively for one machine’s use. It’s best to run locally on your development machine and start and stopped your test or build script. If you share test systems with other developers, you’ll experience unpredictable test failures when multiple people run the test simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a spy server when you can’t integrate it into the external system.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some high-level infrastructure classes depend on low-level infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For tests that check if external communication is done correctly, use a focused integration test (and possibly a spy server).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For parsing and processing, use more direct and faster nullable infrastructure dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;external systems are unreliable. The only sure thing is their eventual failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test that every failure case either logs an error or sends an alert. Also, test for the requests that hang too.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;overlapping sociable tests could instantiate a web of dependencies that take too long or cause - side effects. The tests could be slow, difficult to set up or fail unpredictably&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t do significant work in the constructor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t connect to external systems, start services, or perform long calculations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For code that needs to connect to an external system or start a service, provide a connect or start() method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the need to perform a long calculation, consider lazy initialization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ensures that all logic classes can be constructed without providing any parameters (without using a DI framework).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In practice, this means that most objects instantiate their dependencies in their constructor by default, although they may also accept them as optional parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If parameterless constructor won’t make any sense, provide a test-only factory method. The factory method should provide overridable defaults for mandatory parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factory method is easiest to maintain if it’s located next to the actual constructors in the production code. It should be marked as test-specific and straightforward enough to not need tests of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call dependencies’ methods to help define test expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, if you’re testing an InventoryReport that includes an address in its header, don’t hardcode “123 Main St.” as your expectation for the report header test. Instead, call Address. renderAsOneLine() as part of defining your test expectation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collaborator-based isolation allows you to change features without modifying a lot of tests.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;used to provide nullable infrastructure for tests and avoid duplicating the null checks all over the place&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stub out the third-party library that performs external communication rather than changing your infrastructure code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the stub in the same file as your infrastructure code, so it’s easy to remember and update when your infrastructure code changes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to avoid changing method signatures when you refactor the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, encapsulate the methods with proxy or factory methods. Then, program the proxies and factories, so their parameters are all optional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;application and high-level infrastructure code use their infrastructure dependencies to send data to external systems. They need a way of checking that the data was sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For infrastructure methods that send data and provide a way to observe that data was sent, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/domain-oriented-observability.html#DomainProbesEnableCleanerMore-focusedTests&quot;&gt;domain-oriented observability&lt;/a&gt;. Prefer using observer patterns like &lt;a href=&quot;#send-events&quot;&gt;Send Events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need more than one send result or can’t store the transmitted data, use &lt;a href=&quot;#send-events&quot;&gt;“Send Events”&lt;/a&gt; To test code that uses infrastructure to get data, use Configurable Responses. To test code that responds to infrastructure events uses “Behavior Simulation.”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;send-events&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#send-events&quot; aria-label=&quot;send events permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Send Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you test code that uses infrastructure dependencies to send large blobs of data or sends data multiple times in a row. &lt;a href=&quot;#send-state&quot;&gt;“Send State”&lt;/a&gt; will consume too much memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an observer pattern to emit an event when your infrastructure code sends data. Include data as part of the event payload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When tests need to assert the sent data, they can listen for the events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a helper function that listens for sent events and stores their data in an array to make your tests easier to read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some external systems will push data to you rather than waiting for you to ask for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, your application and high-level infrastructure code need a way to test what happens when their infrastructure dependencies generate those events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add methods to your infrastructure code that simulate receiving an event from an external system. Share as much code as possible with the code that handles actual external events while remaining convenient for tests to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“make asynchronous tests detect success as quickly as possible so that they provide rapid feedback”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“test doubles are fine, but don’t stop there if you can invert the dependency and turn expectations into stubs… or even better, replace the stub with the value it returns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading/learning can be a “priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn for better understanding of others and myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to make fewer mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to increase knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to find meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn improves vocabulary, focus, memory and imagination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odds are that no matter what you’re working on, someone somewhere, who is smarter than you, has probably thought about your problem and put it into a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are few things that hold us back and rob us our productivity, prosperity, positivity and peace of mind and reduce our capacity to think, focus, learn, grow, and be fully human
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drowning in data and rapid change, we long for strategies and tools to regain some semblance of productivity, performance, and peace of mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fleeting ping of digital dopamine pleasure replaces our ability to sustain the attention necessary for deep relationships, deep learning or deep work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overuse of digital technology results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities. Short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from underuse if we overuse technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we’re letting technology do much of our critical thinking and reasoning for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s a difference between reading for understanding and reading for information
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of people confuse knowing the name of something with understanding. While great for exercising your memory, regurgitating facts without solid understanding and context gains you little in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anything easily digested is reading for information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/&quot;&gt;work required to have an opinion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re a knowledge worker, you’re paid to use your brain, so it’s in your best interest to make that brain as efficient as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of pages you read is not as important as the fact you’re enjoying it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;review the notes and highlight them often with post-reading apps such as readwise.io&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;skim a lot of books and read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you lose interest, give it five more pages. Then skim the next chapter. If you’re still not interested, put it down. It’s the author’s job to keep your attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;marking a book is indispensable to reading it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep you awake, not merely conscious, but wide awake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If it is active, reading is thinking and tends to express itself in words, spoken or written.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing your reactions down helps you to remember the thoughts of the author&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomodoro method
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimal time for a task is 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. Each 25-minute chunk is called a “Pomodoro.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;skip liberally: skip anything that doesn’t interest you.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skip, but do so intelligently
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return to it later and ask yourself, “why did I skip this?” Did it offend you? Seem beneath you? Seem too difficult? And did you arrive at that by thinking it through, or is it a reflection of biases inherited from your parents and others? Very often, “our” beliefs are not our own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This practice is how you create yourself instead of discovering yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;find your 100 favorites books and keep re-reading them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;find time to read boils down to choices about how you allocate your time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading isn’t something to be done once a week to check a box; it’s something to do every day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What gets in the way of reading?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid time commuting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid time shopping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid watching TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combine reading with idle activities, waiting for a bus, waiting for a taxi, on the train, on the plane, waiting for your flight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what I read depends on the situation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if there are few minutes, read something simple, rather disposable, and easily digested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;early in the evening, around 8-9, read something without interruption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before going to bed, read something light or something requiring more thought so I can ponder an idea while I’m falling asleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when I’m not reading, I’m trying to think about what I have just read (like waiting in the checkout line at the grocery store)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skimming and superficial reading can be used effectively to increase understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inspectional reading allows us to look at the author’s blueprint and evaluate the merits of a deeper reading experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 sub-types of inspectional reading
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;systematic skimming
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a quick check of the book by
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading preface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;studying the table of contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checking the index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading inside the jacket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give you sufficient knowledge to understand the chapters in the book, pivotal to the author’s argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skimming helps you reach a decision point: Does this book deserve more of my time and attention? If not, you put it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;superficial reading
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just read, don’t ponder the argument, don’t look things up, and don’t write in the margins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you don’t understand something, move on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;now that you understand the book’s contents and structure better, do you want to understand it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;analytical-reading&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#analytical-reading&quot; aria-label=&quot;analytical reading permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Analytical reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/marginalia/&quot;&gt;use marginalia to converse with the author&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the broken fragments of thought that appear scribbled in the margins of books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these fragments help us connect ideas, translate the jargon, and spur critical thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 rules to analytical reading
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;classify the book according to kind and subject matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;state what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in other words, you should be able to state the main question that the book tries to answer, and you should be able to state the subordinate questions if the main question is complex and has many parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after an inspectional read, you will understand the book and the author’s views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theoretical books teach you that something is the case. Practical books teach you how to do something you want to do or think you should do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;syntopical-reading&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#syntopical-reading&quot; aria-label=&quot;syntopical reading permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Syntopical reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;involves reading many books on the same subject and comparing and contrasting ideas, vocabulary, and arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identifying relevant passages, translating the terminology, framing and ordering the questions that need answering, defining the issues, and conversing with the responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand the subject and develop deep fluency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identifying and filling in your knowledge gaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 steps to syntopical reading
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding the relevant passages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find the right books and then the passages that are most relevant to filling your needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bringing the author to terms
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify the keywords and how the author uses them. Each author has probably used different terms and concepts to frame their argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is an exercise in translation and synthesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the questions clear
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus on the questions that you want to answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s important to frame the questions so that all or most authors can be interpreted as providing answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;defining the issues
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask a clear question to which there are multiple answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;translated into your terms, must be ordered to one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understanding multiple perspectives on an issue helps you form an intelligent opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analyzing discussion
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s presumptuous to expect we will find a single unchallenged truth to any of our questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our answer is the conflict of opposing answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the value is the discussion you have with these authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can now have an informed opinion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you must try to discover the leading theme of the book and how the author develops her theme in an orderly way by subdividing it into its essential subordinate themes or topics&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you must try to discover the main ideas, assertions and arguments that constitute the author’s particular message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-the-book-true-in-whole-or-part&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#is-the-book-true-in-whole-or-part&quot; aria-label=&quot;is the book true in whole or part permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;is the book true, in whole or part?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you cannot answer this question until you have answered the first two. You have to know what is being said before you can decide whether it is true or not. When you understand a book, however, you’re obligated to make up your mind if you are reading seriously. Knowing the author’s mind is not enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the book has given you information, you must ask about its significance. Why does the author think it is important to know these things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it important to you to know them? And if the book has informed not only you but also enlightened you, it is necessary to seek further enlightenment by asking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;listen with intent. Write notes in a way you can understand later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TIP
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T - Think about what you’re hoping to retain most from this session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I - identify what is most important in the context of your goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P - prioritize the information that is most valuable for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use your own words whenever possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;handwriting triumphs over typing because writing by hand requires you to exert more effort and process information immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;strong&gt;capture and create&lt;/strong&gt;. Fold the paper into two columns. On the left side, write down what you’re capturing. On the right, write your impression of potential applications, i.e., the areas you can apply this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before reading a new book, take a blank sheet of paper. Write down what you know about the subject you’re about to read - a mind map if you will&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after you’re done a reading session, spend a few minutes adding to the map (I use a different colour ink)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before you start your next reading session, review the mind map(I use mine as a bookmark sometimes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put these mind maps in a binder and periodically review them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you bought this thing, it’s your property, you need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/marginalia/&quot;&gt;write in the margins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the end of each chapter, write a few bullet points that summarize the main idea or specific points. Use your own words and not the author’s. Connect it to something in your life - a memory or another idea. Also, make note of any unanswered questions you had while reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you’re done with the book, put it down for a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick up the book again and go through all your notes. In many cases, reading your notes will be as good as reading the book again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing is the process by which we often discover we don’t know what we’re talking about.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid regression, where your eyes tend to go back and re-read certain words in a sentence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a pacer because attention follows the movement. Using your finger to guide your reading prevents your attention from jumping around the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use your finger as a pacer when reading a physical book or the phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the mouse as a pacer when reading content on a computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid subvocalization: saying words to yourself in your head as you read.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you start reading, count 1, 2, 3, 4. This process will free your mind of the inner narrator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will train your mind to see words on the page like images. Turn what you’re reading into a motion picture experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid word-by-word reading
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;observe chunks of words at a single glance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice expanding your vision to see groups of words, i.e., images for groups of words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing the work required to hold on opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“what an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected business. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m no genius, I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“any fool can know. The point is to understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it takes one to know one”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True experts recognize the limits of what they know what what they do not know. If they find themselves outside of their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Skim a lot of books, read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding is a two way operation; the learner has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has to be willing to argue with the teacher, once he understands what the teacher is saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“go to bed smarter than when you woke up”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when it comes to reading, you don’t need to finish what you start”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pencil,” he argues, “becomes the sign of your alertness while you read”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“first you make your habits and then your habits make you”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“anything is good for your heart is good for you head”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifelong learning adds years to your life and life to your years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEAM: Together Everyone Achieve More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be kind to yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning is not solo, it’s social&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;genius leaves clues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no failure, only failure to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practice makes progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to understand is to know what to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the key to better comprehension is asking better questions”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you shall receive when you ask questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading/learning can be a “priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn for better understanding of others and myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to make fewer mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to increase knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to find meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn improves vocabulary, focus, memory and imagination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odds are that no matter what you’re working on, someone somewhere, who is smarter than you, has probably thought about your problem and put it into a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are few things that hold us back and rob us our productivity, prosperity, positivity and peace of mind and reduce our capacity to think, focus, learn, grow, and be fully human
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drowning in data and rapid change, we long for strategies and tools to regain some semblance of productivity, performance, and peace of mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fleeting ping of digital dopamine pleasure replaces our ability to sustain the attention necessary for deep relationships, deep learning or deep work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overuse of digital technology results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities. Short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from underuse if we overuse technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we’re letting technology do much of our critical thinking and reasoning for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/two-types-of-knowledge/&quot;&gt;two types of knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first type of knowledge is real, it can’t be bought. It can’t be copied. If you want real knowledge you need to earn it. The second type of knowledge is copied. On the surface you know the answer but you lack the understanding to show your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;real knowledge comes from ability to explain things without using jargon or vague terms, understand how things interact and predict the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;distinguish between people who’ve done the work and those who haven’t. The ones who have will pass the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/batesian-mimicry/&quot;&gt;Batesian Mimicry Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 stages of learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unconscious incompetence:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don’t know what you don’t know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you might not even be aware of the fact that something like speed-reading exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you’re also not aware that you’re currently not capable of doing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conscious incompetence:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you know what you don’t know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you’re aware that people have learned to read and comprehend much faster through speed-reading techniques, but you yourself have not had any training in this area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conscious competence:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you’re aware of a skill and have the capacity to perform that skill, but it requires your conscious attention to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unconscious competence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you know how to perform a skill, and it’s second nature to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with speed reading, you would reach the point of unconscious competence when this simply becomes the way you read, without deliberate attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;true mastery
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s second nature to perform a skill at an elite level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m either good at something or I’m not -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I can improve my skills with effort and practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when people give me feedback, it feels like criticism -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I appreciate when people give me feedback ,it helps me learn and grow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m just not good at math -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Math is challenging for me, but I know I can improve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m too shy to speak in front of the class -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;With practice, I can become more confident and improve my public speaking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m already a really good writer. I don’t need to get any better -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;There’s always room for improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who are naturally smart don’t need to try hard to succeed -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No one is born smart. We can all improve with time, effort and persistence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other people’s successes make me feed bad about myself -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Other people’s successes encourage and inspire me. They show me what is possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful people are lucky/talented and have never experienced failure -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Failure is part of success. Most successful people have failed many times, but they succeeded because they didn’t quit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I was as good at baseball as you, it’s not fair -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Your skills as a baseball player inspire me. Do you have any tips to help me improve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s embarrassing when I make a mistake -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;everyone makes mistakes and mistakes are opportunities to learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I don’t try new or hard things, then I won’t fail -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I have to try new and difficult things in order to grow, even if I fail at first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I fail, I get frustrated and give up -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When I fail or get frustrated, I try again using the lessons I’ve learned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure means it is time to give up -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I only truly fail when I stop trying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t do that -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I can’t do that yet, I’m going to keep going, try new strategies, and/or ask for help until I understand it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I don’t improve right away, I get frustrated. I start to criticize myself -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I know improvement takes time and I celebrate the small steps. Even a little progress makes a difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the purpose one has for taking action. The energy required for someone to behave in a particular way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motivation = Purpose x Energy x Small Simple Steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how connected do I feel to my purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how are my day-to-day energy levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what am I allowing to drain my energy that I no longer should?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware of how you’re holding yourself back to limiting beliefs, deeply held beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions we create about who we are, how the world works, what we’re capable of and deserve, and what is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;none of these are preinstalled at birth, which means you pick them up from your environment and those around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any limitations are self-imposed and that your true potential is within your control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be truly present in any situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intelligence is fixed -&gt; your intelligence is not only malleable but dependent on your ability to cultivate a growth mindset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we only use 10% of our brains -&gt; I’m learning to use my whole brain in the best way possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mistakes are failures -&gt; there’s no such thing as failure. Only failure to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knowledge is power -&gt; knowledge + action = power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning new things is very difficult -&gt; when you learn new ways how to learn, the challenge of learning new things can be fun, easier, and more enjoyable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;criticism of other people matters -&gt; it’s not your job to like, love or respect me. It’s mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;genius is born -&gt; genius is not born, it’s made through deep practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small simple steps repeated lead to habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating habits to automate essential parts of our lives is a fundamental streamlining technique that we do largely unconsciously, often to our benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calm the busy minds with meditation, yoga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breathing with 4-7-8 method
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hold your breath for a count of 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exhale completely through your mouth, making a shoosh sound to a count of 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do something that has been causing you stress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schedule time for distraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a specific process for accomplishing something, especially an orderly, logical or systematic way of instruction
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frequently challenge your methods by asking yourself the following questions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have I thought about methods I’m using?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have I learned this method from someone successful at what I’m trying to achieve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if I changed my method, would my results look different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F - Forget&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to forget what you know about the subject, forget situational things that are not urgent, and temporarily forget your limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with a beginner’s mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;employ ACTIVE recall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimal learning occurred when an initial learning session included repeated study and forced-recall testing of all items at least 4 times in a row&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning is not a spectator sport. Practice, take notes or ask questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your superbrain works not by consuming information, but by creating and co-creating it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 quadrants of active learning
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visualization: a picture worth thousands word, same is true for learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;association: associate it with something you already know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotion: emotion + association = long-term memory
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding emotion to association registers your new information in long-term memory. Regardless of emotion you use, emotion makes retention much more robust and durable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;location: associate things to a place you’re familiar most&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T - Teach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you teach something to someone, you get to learn it twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn with the intention of teaching somebody specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feynman technique
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organize and simplify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transmit (optional)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey it to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attempt to transmit the material to at least 1 person who isn’t that familiar with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S - State&lt;/strong&gt;. All learning is state dependant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be fully present and don’t focus on other things that are not urgent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changing your physiology, changes your psychology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as your body moves, your brain grooves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re feeling great, the greater results you will produce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stand up if you can’t sit up tight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facilitates breathing and improves circulation of oxygen to your brain and the rest of your body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;employ space repetition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by spacing the intervals out, you’re exercising neural connections each time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spaced repetition produces long-term and robust retention of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spaced repetition works best when you review material at similar intervals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;review things that you want to understand better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice what you learned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;use your sense of smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;smells bring memories to the forefront of our brains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the scent of rosemary has been shown to improve memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peppermint and lemon promote concentration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-taking&quot;&gt;note taking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;music for the mind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;music stabilizes mental, and emotional rhythms to attain a state of deep concentration and focus in which large amounts of content information can be processed and learned”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;baroque music stands out in particular, although one’s reaction to music is deeply personal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;listen with your whole brain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remember acronym HEAR - halt, empathy, anticipate, review
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be attentive, be interested, be alert and not distracted, create a positive atmosphere through non-verbal behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be a sounding board - allow the speaker to bounce ideas and feelings off you while assuming a non-judgmental, non-critical manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t interrogate, don’t ask a lot of questions, they can give the impression you’re grilling the speaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;act like a mirror, reflect back what you think the speaker is saying and feeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t discount the speaker’s feelings by using stock phrases like “it’s not that bad,” or “you will feel better tomorrow”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t let the speaker hook you. This can happen if you get angry or upset, allow yourself to get involved in an argument, or pass judgment on the other person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;indicate you’re listening by
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;providing brief, noncommittal acknowledging responses, e.g., “Uh-huh,”, “I see”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giving nonverbal acknowledgements, e.g., head nodding, facial expressions matching the speaker, open and relaxed body expression, eye contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invitations to say more, e.g., “tell me about it,” “I’ d like to hear more about that”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do reflect back to the speaker what you understand and how you think the speaker feels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t change subject or move in a new direction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t rehearse in your own head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t teach or give advice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 morning habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remember your dreams, make your bed, hydrate, brush your teeth with the opposite hand, deep breathing exercises, brain tea, journaling, HIT workout (high intensity interval training), brain power smoothie, read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first 60 minutes can either set you up for maximum productivity and bring you closer to your long-term and short-term goals or cause you to lose another day to distractions and mental fog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;combining audio listening with other activities such as washing dishes, driving, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use playback speed at 1.5, 1.7 to skim through materials to get the key ideas before spending more time in reading the book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark up the book while reading it. Questions, thoughts. And, more important connections to other ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the end of each chapter, without looking back, write some notes on the main points/arguments/take-away. Then look back through the chapter and write down anything you missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specifically note anything that was in the chapter that you can apply somewhere else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;summary and review the notes periodically&lt;/li&gt;

Inside the barrel, there is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;board&lt;/code&gt; that closely resembles the shape of a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;diamond&lt;/code&gt;. The diamond drops on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Sir lancelot&lt;/code&gt; head. He is then rushed to emergency in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mask&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mask&lt;/code&gt; as it turns out is dirty that it needs to be cleaned with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;toothpaste&lt;/code&gt;. The leftover toothpaste is thrown away and now stuck at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sign&lt;/code&gt; outside the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;With the sun list, we now have 20 pegs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;associate the item with the Sun List.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to create a strong memorable association, we need to use a vivid imagination. We should create an image in our head that is illogical, funny, or cool to make it memorable
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to remember #9 is people, we could image cat people. That’s weird, and funny so it’s memorable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;create 10 landmarks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select 2 rooms in your home and create 5 landmarks in each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;imagine you are standing in the doorway and go clockwise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick places, not empty space - so don’t pick a corner of the room; pick something in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick things that are relatively large - so pick the coffee table, not the figures in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick only one of each item per room, if you have 4 chairs, use one chair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you need to create more than 10 landmarks, use other rooms. You can also use your office, your car, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pair each key point to a landmark
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create an image for each key point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put each key point into its corresponding place&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you have ANT(s), automatic negative talk, your brain releases chemicals that make you feel bad. Moreover, your memory, learning and judgment are affected negatively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify what strain of ANT you have (mind-reading, blame, labeling, guilt, or fortune-telling) and then challenge it by talking back to it, which you can do with positive affirmations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with the ABRA technique, you acknowledge, breathe in, release, and align
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A - acknowledge ANT because what you resist persist.So acknowledging the ANT helps you to avoid having to continuously fight it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B - deep breathing helps you relax and focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R - releasing the thought helps you to release it out of your body before you spend time comtemplating it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A - align yourself back to the truth about who you are. Saying the opposite of the negative thought, which is simply a positive affirmation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a more analytical technique from Dr. Daniel Ame requires you to ask some questions, it involves a few steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself if the ANT is true&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself if it’s possible eto absolutely know that it’s true&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself how you react when you think that thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself who you would be if you didn’t have that thought, how would you feel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the opposite of that ANT? What is a positive affirmation you can use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contemplating your ANT(s) like this can help you see they are not truths but thoughts made up of fears, worries, or criticism. And, ending with the positive affirmation can help you move towards better thoughts and beliefs that help you have more happiness.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;high-quality foods that contain lots of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants nourishes the brain and protects it from oxidative stress, the waste produced when the body use oxygen, which can damage cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exercise regularly
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when your body moves, your brain grooves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exercise changes the brain in ways that protect memory and thinking skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get your brain nutrient
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take a blood test and verify your deficiencies. Then take the appropriate supplements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep a positive peer group
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who you spend time with is who you become. People who encourage you and hold you to the  higher standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;join community online (facebook, etc…) to support you with your interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain a clean environment
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meaning clean air, water and space around you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get good sleep
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dreaming is essential for fantastic ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clear your brain of plaque that leads to dementia and Alzheimer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sleep is vital for protecting you against age-related brain damage, and it is crucial for day-to-day functioning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protect your brain
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid putting your phone under your pillow and protect yourself from head injuries by wearing a helmet when cycling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn new things
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neuroplasticity (connections in your brain) can be instigated through learning new things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce your stress through yoga, meditation, or massages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing the work required to hold on opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“what an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected business. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m no genius, I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“any fool can know. The point is to understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it takes one to know one”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True experts recognize the limits of what they know what what they do not know. If they find themselves outside of their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skim a lot of books, read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding is a two way operation; the learner has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has to be willing to argue with the teacher, once he understands what the teacher is saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“go to bed smarter than when you woke up”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pencil,” he argues, “becomes the sign of your alertness while you read”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first you make your habits and then your habits make you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anything is good for your heart is good for you head&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifelong learning adds years to your life and life to your years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEAM: Together Everyone Achieve More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be kind to yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning is not solo, it’s social&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;genius leaves clues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no failure, only failure to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practice makes progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to understand is to know what to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the key to better comprehension is asking better questions”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you shall receive when you ask questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading/learning can be a “priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn for better understanding of others and myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to make fewer mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to increase knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to find meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn improves vocabulary, focus, memory and imagination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odds are that no matter what you’re working on, someone somewhere, who is smarter than you, has probably thought about your problem and put it into a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are few things that hold us back and rob us our productivity, prosperity, positivity and peace of mind and reduce our capacity to think, focus, learn, grow, and be fully human
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drowning in data and rapid change, we long for strategies and tools to regain some semblance of productivity, performance, and peace of mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fleeting ping of digital dopamine pleasure replaces our ability to sustain the attention necessary for deep relationships, deep learning or deep work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overuse of digital technology results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities. Short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from underuse if we overuse technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we’re letting technology do much of our critical thinking and reasoning for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing the work required to hold on opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“what an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected business. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m no genius, I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“any fool can know. The point is to understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it takes one to know one”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True experts recognize the limits of what they know what what they do not know. If they find themselves outside of their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Skim a lot of books, read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding is a two way operation; the learner has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has to be willing to argue with the teacher, once he understands what the teacher is saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“go to bed smarter than when you woke up”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when it comes to reading, you don’t need to finish what you start”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pencil,” he argues, “becomes the sign of your alertness while you read”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“first you make your habits and then your habits make you”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“anything is good for your heart is good for you head”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;be kind to yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning is not solo, it’s social&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;genius leaves clues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no failure, only failure to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practice makes progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to understand is to know what to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the key to better comprehension is asking better questions”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/circle-of-competence/&quot;&gt;circle of competence&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each of us, through experience or study, has built up useful knowledge on certain areas of the world. Some areas are understood by most of us, while some areas require a lot more specialty to evaluate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that basic knowledge, along with some understanding of accounting and a little bit of study, would enable one to evaluate and invest in any number of restaurants and restaurant chains, public or private.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where should we devote our limited time in life, to achieve the most success? define the perimeter of your circle of competence, and operate inside. Over time, work to expand that circle but never fool yourself about where it stands today, and never be afraid to say “I don’t know”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you know when to follow the rules and when they’ll get you in trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to do the reading, you have to talk to competent people and understand their arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to think about key variables and how they interact over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to listen and chase down arguments that run counter to your views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to think about how you might be fooling yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to see the issue from multiple perspectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need to become your most intelligent critic and have the intellectual honesty to kill some of your best-loved ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doing the work counteracts our natural desire to seek out only information that confirms that we believe we know.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;most of your results are going to come from just a small percentage of your effort or work.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of relationships lead to 80% happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% exercises lead to 80% of health benefit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of items on your todo list lead to 80% of productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of foods you eat cause 80% of your sickness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by taking 10 minutes per day for prioritization, you can double your productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by looking at what experiences give you the most delight, you can begin to engineer your life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reverse-engineer complicated situations and unleash creative possibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reasoning from first principles, it’s a tool to help clarify complicated problems by separating the underlying ideas or facts from any assumptions based on them. what remains are essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you know the first principles of something, you can build the rest of your knowledge around them to produce something new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s one of the best ways to learn to think for yourself, unlock your creative potential, and move from linear to non-linear results.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;socratic questioning
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (why do I think this? what exactly do I think?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;challenging assumptions (how do I know this is true? what if I thought the opposite?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looking for evidence (how can I back this up? what are the sources?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;considering alternative perspectives (what might others think? how do I know I’m correct?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;examining consequences and implications (what if I am wrong? what are the consequences if I am?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;questioning the original questions (why did I think that? was I correct? what conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the process stops you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses. This process helps you build something that lasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;five why?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asking why with the hope to get closer to the truth that we try to understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing the work required to hold on opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“what an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected business. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m no genius, I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“any fool can know. The point is to understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it takes one to know one”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True experts recognize the limits of what they know what what they do not know. If they find themselves outside of their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Skim a lot of books, read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding is a two way operation; the learner has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has to be willing to argue with the teacher, once he understands what the teacher is saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“go to bed smarter than when you woke up”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when it comes to reading, you don’t need to finish what you start”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pencil,” he argues, “becomes the sign of your alertness while you read”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“first you make your habits and then your habits make you”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“anything is good for your heart is good for you head”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifelong learning adds years to your life and life to your years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEAM: Together Everyone Achieve More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be kind to yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning is not solo, it’s social&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;genius leaves clues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no failure, only failure to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practice makes progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to understand is to know what to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the key to better comprehension is asking better questions”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you shall receive when you ask questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when people return to their desk, will they be able to apply what they’ve learnt in a useful way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a fair idea who will come and what’s the production code and tests look like at present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discuss with attendee what they’re interested in learning and what they are currently struggling with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bloom’s taxonomy, thinking skills can be described in terms of six broad categories
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, creating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help you plan exercises and teaching materials at an appropriate level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with materials to build remembering, understanding and applying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when those thinking skills are in place, you can do more analyzing, evaluating and creating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a long lists of good &lt;strong&gt;verbs&lt;/strong&gt; to describe thinking skills in each category. These words are useful as a prompt or start of a sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each person who comes to your learning hour has a unique background, and what they’re going to learn needs to be integrated with what they already know for it to stick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4C’s:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connect: get people in the right head-space for learning about the topic together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concept: introduce the new skills or ideas or information you want the participants to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concrete: hands-on exercises to practice skills or figure out how things work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conclusions: an opportunity for people to consolidate and internalize what they’ve learnt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you want to help people to be present mentally, fuel their curiosity, let them work out what they need to do, and to come to their own understanding of the topic.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;movement trump sitting&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you want people to move out of a sitting position at least every 10-15 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arrange the chairs so people physically stand up and move a chair to the right every time you change typist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you gather observations in retrospective, people can each walk up to the whiteboard and stick their notes onto it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when reviewing code, you can stick printouts to the walls and have people move around to look at them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re working together remotely, get people to take breaks and leave their desks from time to time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;talking trumps listening&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you talk about what you just heard it reinforces your memory of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talking also gives opportunities for feedback from others about how well you seem to understand the topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask people to pair up to discuss a topic or share experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;images trumps words&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the picture and associated story evokes an emotion, it would make it easier to pay attention and recall it later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term memories often comprise of images and associated emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;writing trumps reading&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you read, it’s easier for your mind to wander.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing also makes the information multi-sensory, you physically move a pen on some paper as well as see the text on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;draw lines and boxes to situate the information in space and relate it to other information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide handouts, notes and quizzes that people can annotate. Ask people to write conclusions and observations on sticky notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;shorter trumps longer&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;student’s minds tend to drift after about 10 minutes of traditional lecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to keep people’s attention, divide your presentations into 10-20 minute chunks and in between spend at least 1-2 minutes on some other activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perhaps ask people to review or discuss the material presented so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break off occasionally for Q&amp;#x26;A, or to ask people to note down what they observed so far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;different trumps same&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anything new or unexpected will catch people’s attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;games and simulations an exercises can contain built-in surprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suddenly change requirement mid-exercise. Keep it fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One example learning objectives
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe some characteristics of approval testing -&gt; remembering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compare approval testing with assertion-based testing -&gt; understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the approvals framework to write test cases -&gt; applying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;deliberate-practice&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#deliberate-practice&quot; aria-label=&quot;deliberate practice permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deliberate practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in order to use red-green-refactor cycle competently, you need to
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify the next test case that will incrementally improve your solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design the specifics of that test case and see it fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement a solution design which is testable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refactor to improve your design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re weak in any one of those component skills, you will struggle to do TDD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the great advantage of practice exercises is we can find ones that let us work on those component skills individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a teacher, I want to plan a series of learning hours that will be at just hte right level so people don’t get bored and don’t get overwhelmed or frustrated.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;think about what we did today. If you had to explain the main idea of TDD to someone else, what would you say?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write your explanation in a sentence or two on a post-it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put up a flipchart with the question “what is the main idea of TDD?” Ask people to stick their post-it notes on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read some notes out to the group before you partway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hang the poster somewhere prominent afterwards, perhaps in the team area or coffee room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if working remotely, they can each write their sentence or two in a shared online document.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;XP teams are very code-centric and focused on making functional software. When reflection and learning happen, it’s often in a watered down, haphazard way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone has to decide to make learning not just an individual experience but a collective experience. When that happens, learning isn’t just something that occurs naturally, it is something that the company uses to drive the future of business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“what is the simplest, most cost-effective way to share learnings?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a group of people who functioned together in an extraordinary way, who trusted one another, who complemented each others’ strengths and compensated for each others’ limitations, who had common goals were larger than individual goals, and who produced extraordinary results.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the team that became great didn’t start off great - it &lt;strong&gt;learned&lt;/strong&gt; how to produce extraordinary results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a programmer’s study group will meet regularly in a comfortable place to delve into important technical topics. These topics can come from group’s learning repository, from books or articles, or even from a guest participant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a simple, security-free, browser-based learning repository, such as Ward Cunningham’s Wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just install it and asking folks to use it isn’t enough. Teams need to establish usage convention
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developers will quickly jot down learnings on index cards, as they work, and when they integrate their code, they can integrate significant learnings as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;atlassian confluence provides similar functionality but how can we organize and maintain the group knowledge effectively?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.industriallogic.com/img/blog/2012/03/khdraft1.pdf&quot;&gt;a pattern language for study groups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a study group can make a difficult book easier to understand, it can succeed where an unsatisfying class fails, and it can support you if your environment doesn’t support your ongoing learning and growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once teams produce enough learning content they will need to reflect on and discuss it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are 2 good places to do this: for technical matters, the best place is a programmer’s study group; and for team, people or process maters, the best place is in an iteration retrospective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every programmer on the team needed to at least be aware of the system’s potent smells. This would enable them all to pay attention to these smells and consider how to refactor them out of existence&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look into process of documenting these potent smells (index cards, wiki, etc…). This would eventually led to direct action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recommend that groups meet for 2 hours if they want to delve deeply into a subject, though one-hour meetings are fine for covering topics quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;absolutely no one should play the role of lecturer or teacher in a study group.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the group meets to conduct group learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if someone is expert in a certain technical area, that individual ought to help others learn, not show off or talk down to participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuously learning coach
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the coach is the leader of the team. If the coach doesn’t value learning, the team won’t either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the coach must lead by example. This means that the coach will seek out and obtain coaching and mentoring from the best sources available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coaches must strive to learn about their customer’s needs, team or personality conflicts, new technologies, and the latest wisdom about XP and other lightweight methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;patterns are grouped into 4 secions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spirit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after identifying a great source knowledge in a subject, work to create a rewarding, intellectually safe environment for hte study of that subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contains &lt;a href=&quot;#knowledge-hydrant&quot;&gt;knowledge hydrant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#pool-of-insight&quot;&gt;pool of insight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#safe-place&quot;&gt;safe place&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#enduring-energy&quot;&gt;enduring energy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;#kindred-collaborators&quot;&gt;kindred collaborator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;atmosphere
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;establish a home for the study group that is centrally located, comfortable, aesthetically pleasing and conductive a dialogue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contains &lt;a href=&quot;#common-ground&quot;&gt;common ground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#public-living-room&quot;&gt;public living room&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#intimate-circle&quot;&gt;intimate circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#virtual-space&quot;&gt;virtual space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;roles
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lead and energize the group, come prepared and help guide dialogues so that they are insightful and productive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contains &lt;a href=&quot;#enthusiastic-leader&quot;&gt;enthusiastic leader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#motivated-moderator&quot;&gt;motivated moderator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#active-participant&quot;&gt;active participant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#prepared-participant&quot;&gt;prepared participant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;#distinguished-participant&quot;&gt;distinguished participant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow customs that will re-enforce the spirit of the group, piquing participant’s interest in dialogues, accomodating different learning levels, making the study of literature easier, recording group experiences, and drawing people closer together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contains &lt;a href=&quot;#opening-question&quot;&gt;opening question&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#sequential-study&quot;&gt;sequential study&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#agenda&quot;&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#subgroup&quot;&gt;subgroup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#distinguished-diary&quot;&gt;distributed diary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#after-hours&quot;&gt;after hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;retrospectives&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#retrospectives&quot; aria-label=&quot;retrospectives permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;retrospectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the continuous learning approach to retrospectives means they come not at the end of a project, but at the end of every iteration.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conducting iteration retrospectives will enable teams to quickly adjust and improve their performance, because they will be continuously revisiting these questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what worked well?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what did we learn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what should we do differently next time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what still puzzles us?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what happened?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people have a fear of retrospectives, because they have a fear of being attacked, of being made to look foolish, of getting a poor performance review or of hurting someone’s feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s detrimental to retrospectives if people are afraid, or if there is an atmosphere of blame, criticism, sarcasm, or even humor at other people’s expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills, and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s vital that the facilitator be an outsider and not a member of the team involved in the retrospective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;participants take the lessons learned during the retrospective and turn them into concrete ideas for improving their development process.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the key to retrospective is to make sure you’re solving the correct problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;knowledge-hydrant&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#knowledge-hydrant&quot; aria-label=&quot;knowledge hydrant permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;knowledge hydrant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where can one obtain knowledge in its fullest unfiltered, unsimplified form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great literature tends to be hard to study and understand. Many people either aren’t prepared to do this hard work or simply don’t want to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;authors of great literature commonly reference, extend, or refute ideas communicated by their ancestors or peers. This can make it doubly hard to understand their writings, since one may need to understand referenced works in order to understand author’s own work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as great literature ages, people don’t believe it will contain the “modern” knowledge they need. So even if some great book written 30 years ago contains the exact knowledge they seek, people won’t find it, for they are unaware of the abundance of knowledge contained in older works of literature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the hard work put into the study of great literature is worthwhile because it ensures that people retain the knowledge they wish to obtain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great literature is much easier to understand when it is studied in an intelligent sequence &lt;a href=&quot;#sequential-study&quot;&gt;sequential study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is easier and more rewarding to study great literature with other people &lt;a href=&quot;#pool-of-insight&quot;&gt;pool of insight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discover the great literature in your profession or area of interest - the finest books, articles, and speeches ever written, and then begin an earnest study of these works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you find the great literature worthy of study? Ask people. Ask knowledgeable people which authors they like, what are their favorite books, what profoundly influenced them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after identifying the works, form or join a study group, &lt;a href=&quot;#pool-of-insight&quot;&gt;pool of insight&lt;/a&gt;, order the works to be studied &lt;a href=&quot;#sequential-study&quot;&gt;sequential study&lt;/a&gt; and compose an &lt;a href=&quot;#agenda&quot;&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pool-of-insight&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#pool-of-insight&quot; aria-label=&quot;pool of insight permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;pool of insight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once you’ve discovered your &lt;a href=&quot;#knowledge-hydrant&quot;&gt;knowledge hydrant&lt;/a&gt;, it can be overshelming to drink from it. This pattern suggests how to make the study of great literature easier and more rewarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s nothing wrong with reading and studying literature on one’s own. But great literature is worth knowing well, and individual study pales in comparison with teh study of literature in a group dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in communicating how they understand something, people may
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clarify what confused others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expose their own misunderstandings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveal new ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;articulate that which they didn’t know they knew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a dialogue, nobody is trying to win. Everybody wins if anybody wins.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whenever any mistake is discovered on the part of anybody, everybody gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a spirit present in dialogues that one doesn’t find in many other learning environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many groups sustain a group’s spirit by meeting weekly or biweekly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read and study literature on one’s own, but discuss it with others in a regular study group. Aim to ask questions about you don’t know and explain what you do know. Your exchanges with colleagues will enrich your understanding immensely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the best study groups are those in which individuals feel comfortable learning with others &lt;a href=&quot;#safe-place&quot;&gt;safe place&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some environments promote dialogues, &lt;a href=&quot;#common-ground&quot;&gt;common ground&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#public-living-room&quot;&gt;public living room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the most enriching study happens when a group has a &lt;a href=&quot;#motivated-moderator&quot;&gt;motivated moderator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#prepared-participants&quot;&gt;prepared participants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;safe-place&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#safe-place&quot; aria-label=&quot;safe place permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;safe place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a good physical environment &lt;a href=&quot;#common-ground&quot;&gt;common ground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#public-living-room&quot;&gt;public living room&lt;/a&gt; is vital for any study group. Equally vital, is the intellectual environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;loud-mouths, show-offs, know-it-alls, and people who are overly competitive, adversarial or confrontational, can make other uncomfortable or insecure, and create an environment that is not conductive to learning, sharing or the building of ideas&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when places of learning have highly critical or judgemental natures, an individual’s ability to learn can easily be compromised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;treat each other as colleagues with respect, despite differences in opinion, acknowledges the mutual risk and establishes the sense of safety in facing the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generally, as long as the people arguing are remaining civil (treat each other with kindness, consideration and respect) and as long as the argument isn’t too far off the subject being studied, it can be quite instructive for a group to listen and learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually, it is best for someone who is intimate with the group’s customs to approach the individual during a short break or &lt;a href=&quot;#after-hours&quot;&gt;after hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;establish a warm, tolerant, polite and focused environment in which individuals help each other where everyone is comfortable to ask questions and make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in practice, there will always be some level of personality conflicts or discord within a group. It can help if people get together after a session, &lt;a href=&quot;#after-hours&quot;&gt;after hours&lt;/a&gt;, to talk about the issues.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this pattern identifies what is needed in a study group to bring it to life, and sustain it over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s fairly easy to start a study group. But keeping it going, so that members are active, dialogues are insightful, and the group is long-lived, is another matter altogether.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a study group’s energy initially comes from its founder. If the founder is genuinely interested in creating thriving, long-lasting &lt;a href=&quot;#pool-of-insight&quot;&gt;pool of insight&lt;/a&gt;, to improve himself/herself and his community, the group will start life with a powerful energy. But if founder is merely interested in short-term gains, or personal recognition, the group will be short-lived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In considering the long-term vitality of the group, there are many decisions to make
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when will the group meet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how long will its meetings be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what will be studied?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if poor or uninformed decisions are made about these issues, a group may be never take root or be long-lived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frequent meetings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s difficult to maintain any sort of low or continuous energy. A month between meetings is usually far too long for people to maintain focus and enthusiasm. Therefore, have the group meet weekly or bi-weekly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these frequent meetings will allow a group to study effectively and may lead some members to become &lt;a href=&quot;#kindred-collaborators&quot;&gt;kindred collaborators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hour meetings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a one hour meeting is typically not enough time for a group to have an insightful dialogue on a piece of literature. But three hours is too much time, since most participants can’t actively engage in dialogue for that long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore, limit dialogues to a maximum of 2 hours, and if energy has waned significantly before that time, finish the meeting early&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short breaks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at a certain time in a dialogue, a group’s intensity focus and effectiveness will begin to diminish. If the group doesn’t take a break at this time, the quality of the dialogue may begin to deteriorate and people will become uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore, allow for a short (10 or 15 minute) break in the middle of a study group session, to let members reflect, chat, use the restrooms, and prepare for the next half of the dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid group meetings in dull, stuffy, maybe windowless, conference room since the location and space will play a huge role in sustaining a group’s energy.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;places that attract people is usually, spacious, comfortable, energetic. It helps creating bonding and bring life to the dialogues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create study groups out of genuine enthusiasm to study a subject in-depth. Meet weekly or bi-weekly for 2 hours, and have a short-break in the middle. Choose a meeting location where people will enjoy passing time, and study only those writings which are worthy of group’s attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for ideal meeting environment, look for &lt;a href=&quot;#common-ground&quot;&gt;common ground&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#public-living-room&quot;&gt;public living room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create &lt;a href=&quot;#subgroup&quot;&gt;subgroups&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#study-cycle&quot;&gt;study cycle&lt;/a&gt; to let people place their energy where they best see fit. And when group energy is low, have a &lt;a href=&quot;#distinguished-participant&quot;&gt;distinguished participant&lt;/a&gt; join the group for an evening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is a custom of some groups to go out after meetings &lt;a href=&quot;#after-hours&quot;&gt;after hours&lt;/a&gt; to partake in food and drink. This social time can go far towards sustaining relationships and adding energy back to a group…&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a study group has an enduring energy, people get to know each other, a community forms, and there is a lasting possibility for collaborations and working relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so many people dislike networking. They want to grow professionally, and they think that networking can help, but they don’t know how, where and with whom to network effectively.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many people feel isolated in their jobs. So much of their time is spent working that there is little time left to pursue genuinely interests them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some try to organize study groups within their own companies, but if often fails due to lack of interest, or because many people prefer to be outside of work when they have any free time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some people go to conferences lectures, user groups and parties in the hope of advancing their careers and themselves. Often, they end up frustrated in reality, they don’t grow professionally at these meetings and their networking is ineffective. The trouble often results from what may be described as weak connections that develop between people who meet in large groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In frequently meeting study group, people get to know each other over time. They learn what they like and dislike, what they excel at and where they are weak, where they are in their careers and where they’d like to go. This level of familiarity forms the foundation for a rich network that can yield very real career and collaboration possibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As one gets to know others within a group, one can get a very good idea of who would be good for a specific projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;quality networking happens best when a study group is a &lt;a href=&quot;#safe-place&quot;&gt;safe place&lt;/a&gt; composed of diverse individuals and true peers. The best time for networking is either before study groups meets or &lt;a href=&quot;#after-hours&quot;&gt;after hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-ground&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#common-ground&quot; aria-label=&quot;common ground permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;common ground&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people lack a place where they can have regular, meaning ful dialogues with other people in a casual, social setting. Work and home don’t provide it, and many clubs or groups also don’t provide it because they meet in lifeless environments that feel like someone else’s turf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people need informal public places where they can gather, put aside the concerns of work and home, relax and talk. Germany’s beer gardens, English’s pubs, and French and Viennese cafes created this outlet in people’s lives, providing a neutral ground where all are equal and conversation is the main activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;without such places, the urban area fails to nourish the kinds of relationships and the diversity of human contact that are essence of the city. Deprived of these settings, people remain lonely within their crowds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s naturally to choose one of the company’s conference rooms as a meeting location as it is spacious quiet, filled with white boards, available after hours, and free. However, it’s not a good choice, since both employees and visitors to the company, generally don’t like to spend their free time in stuffy, stale, office environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hold public study groups where diverse individuals will all be on common ground. The best locations are easy for people to get to, but not too close to their offices or homes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once common ground has been selected, a group must find a &lt;a href=&quot;#public-living-room&quot;&gt;public living room&lt;/a&gt;, a comfortable, relaxing, dialogue-friendly place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-living-room&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#public-living-room&quot; aria-label=&quot;public living room permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;public living room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inhospitable physical locations - stale, lifeless, badly lit, and uninviting - stifle individuals and thereby hinder lively, engaging dialogues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow traffic to flow with minimum disruptions since members often arrive late, leave early, get up for snacks or use the restrooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sitting circle
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;place each sitting space in a position which is protected, not cut by paths or movements, roughly circular, made so that the room itself helps suggest the circle, not too strongly, with pats and activities around it, so that people naturally gravitate toward the chairs when they get into the mood to sit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;different chairs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps people understand that the seating preferences of diverse people differ and that a group will be most comfortable if a space is outfitted with “a variety of different chairs, some big, some small, some softer than others, some rockers, some very old, some new, with arms, without arms, some wicker, some wool, some cloth.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pool of light
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;place the lights low, and apart, to form individual pools of light which encompass chairs and tables, like bubbles to reinforce the social character of the spaces which they form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose a warm, spacious establishment where people will enjoy mingling before and after study session, where there is comfortable, rearrangable furniture, plenty of warm lighting, and a variety of foods and drinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some groups may choose to reserve space or arrange to meet at a location when it closes to the public to avoid noises at certain times of day.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Are we engaged and joyful (&lt;strong&gt;ALIVE&lt;/strong&gt;) here? How can I make it more so?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things that can boost aliveness: urgency and need, jokes and humor, imperfection and vulnerability, mastery and success, music and singing, games and play, anything cute, intense colors, smells, textures, tastes, friend ship, new and old, variety, change of scene, full belly, comfort, rest, hydration, safety, consent, love and romance, risk and danger, storytelling and role models, beauty, ugliness, family and community, healthy competition, laughter and competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we doing something real (&lt;strong&gt;FLUENCY&lt;/strong&gt;) here - how can we do that even more so?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fluency is defined unconscious competence, whatever you can do when there is no time to think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deliberate practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this space driving high-quality interactions and experiences (&lt;strong&gt;SETTING&lt;/strong&gt;)? How can it do that even more?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose your &lt;strong&gt;SETTING FIRST&lt;/strong&gt; to come closest to performing the skills you learn in the environment where you’ll apply them for real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we acting with clarity and confidence (&lt;strong&gt;OBVIOUS&lt;/strong&gt;)? How can we support that even more so?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;start obvious, stay obvious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning goals can be made more obvious in many ways:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk slowly and clearly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use concise, commonly understood language; avoid jargon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;illuminate the learning space sufficiently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tune into the diverse abilities and disabilities of the learners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pump up emotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use iconic illustrations, materials, and tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use familiar and favorite tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use solid, clearly defined colors and shapes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the same colors, shapes, icons, or sounds to reinforce meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus learning on physical interactions relevant to the skill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offer more practice for difficult or challenging BITE-SIZED PIECES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offer more opportunities to follow-the-leader, COPY-CAT, or IMITATE THE EXPERT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when in doubt, just make it more obvious - whatever that means in your situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we steadily improving in effectiveness (&lt;strong&gt;FOCUS ON FLOW&lt;/strong&gt;)? How can we do that even better?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when in doubt, &lt;strong&gt;mumble&lt;/strong&gt; your way through it by just picking a starting point, and refine the design later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you find yourself stuck
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find something that is difficult to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break it down into smallest meaningful chunks of skill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work through them piece by piece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus on the smallest meaningful chunk of skill, and the smallest number of tools, so that we can obtain the fluent action around those tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only introduce new MOVE or BITE-SIZED PIECES of learning right when we need them, and not before (&lt;strong&gt;JUST IN TIME&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anytime you notice yourself becoming lost, dizzy, or overwhelmed by the learning process, call &lt;strong&gt;FULL&lt;/strong&gt;, and go somewhere else, get a drink, take a breather, use the bathroom, whatever, but remember to come back and jump back into learning as soon as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two highest levels of influence are achieved when (1) people follow you because of what you’ve done for them and (2) people follow you because of who you are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft skills link hard skills to operational productivity, organizational synergy, and commercial relevance because all require sound human commitment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no such thing as a neutral exchange. You leave someone either a little better or a little worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental techniques in dealing with people
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t criticize, condemn or complain. This makes them defensive and justifies their actions. Instead, praising them lowers their defence, and they will be more receptive to your feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give honest and sincere appreciation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arouse in the other person an eager want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;become genuinely interested in other people
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e., remember other people’s birthdays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;send LinkedIn messages of congratulations when someone in your network gets a promotion or professional success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coordinate office parties for personal celebrations such as births, accomplishments or birthdays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people crave the feeling of importance. “What is there about him that I can honestly admire?”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everyone has something they can teach you, and you benefit by figuring out what that is. This belief leads to genuine interest and appreciation for other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the other person feel important and do it sincerely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being good with people is about making people feel good/important and being interested in them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appeal to the other person’s interests. Virtually all people care more about what they want than what you want
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep asking yourself - “what is it that this person wants?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;angry people are often angry because they feel unheard. Once you sympathize with them, they will soften their anger substantially.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a person’s name is the most important word in any language. Use it often and respect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. Ask questions that they will enjoy answering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To influence to do things, praise and appreciation are more effective than orders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk in terms of the other person’s interests.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let the other person do a great deal of the talking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;smile
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;approach people with a positive demeanour. Smile and be happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;begin in a friendly way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dramatize your ideas. Sometimes ideas are not enough, and the truth must be made vivid, interesting, and dramatic. Television has been doing it for years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;throw down a challenge. The thing that most motivates people is the game. Everyone desires to excel and prove their worth. If we want someone to do something, we must give them a challenge, and they will often rise to meet it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the other person to say “yes, yes” immediately.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with questions to which the other person will answer yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not begin by emphasizing the aspects in which the other person and we differ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin by emphasizing and continue emphasizing the things on which we agree. People must be started in the affirmative direction, and they will often follow readily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never tell someone they are wrong, but rather lead them where we would like them to go with questions that they will answer “yes” to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appeal to nobler motives. Everyone likes to be glorious in their own eyes. People believe that they do things for noble and morally upright reasons. If we can appeal to others’ noble motives, we can successfully convince them to follow our ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making people glad to do what you want. Encourage people to think about everyone else’s perspective, have high expectations, and help people get what they want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bury Your Boomerangs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The moment you use a medium to criticize, the subject of your criticism is compelled to defend. And when another is defensive, there is little you can say to break through the barriers he has raised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this way, critical comments act like invisible boomerangs. They return to the thrower’s head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The simplest way is to focus on improving yourself instead of others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift your media use from an exposé and objection to a spirit of encouragement and exhortation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resist badmouthing as a differentiation strategy. Its long-term effect is far more harmful than helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your messages meaningful by removing your agenda. Above all, the recipients of every bit of your communication want value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calm yourself before communicating with another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affirm What’s Good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider sending that same message to those you’d like to influence. Have you let them know just how valuable you think they are? There is great power in this simple principle, embodied regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We all have an innate, unquenchable desire to know we are valued and matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emerson wrote, “Every man is entitled to be valued for his best moments.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which relationship is most strained in your life right now? What would it look like if you began focusing on that person’s best moments and sought to affirm them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately, gaining influence is about setting yourself apart, stepping to a higher plane in mind and heart of another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are all united by one desire to be valued by another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with Core Desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Influencing others is not a matter of outsmarting them. It is a matter of discerning what they truly want and offering it to them in a mutually beneficial package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So much of our digital communication is one way that we believe we have limited opportunity to uncover another’s perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are far more inclined to focus on how we can best broadcast our points from our perspective, quickly, broadly, or both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is easy to get so caught up in the fray that we forget what we aim for: connection, influence, agreement, and collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to approach arguments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instead, approach with an open-minded view: “I may be wrong; I often am. And if I’m wrong, I want to change and be right. Let’s discuss the facts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;praise the other person for a trait that will help resolve the argument - like their patience, open-mindedness, fairness, and receptivity to new facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand that the other person has a valid view of the situation. Your job is to understand what led them to believe what they believe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;express sympathy for their situation. “You have the absolute right to be upset. If I were in your shoes, I would be too”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong.”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk through. Do NOT interrupt as they’re speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask people where they feel the problems are. Ask for their opinions on how best to proceed. Ask lots of questions instead of stating commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only way to get the best out of an argument is to avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for areas of agreement. Try to build bridges of understanding. Talk about common goals and what you agree on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let the other person feel that the idea is his or her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasize how your position serves the other person’s interests and incentives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only way to get the best out of an argument is to avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things as you are. Think of them as people who want to help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;poop sandwich method
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bread: sincere appreciation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;poop: bad news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bread: a compliment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to keep a disagreement from being an argument
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welcome the disagreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distrust your first instinctive impression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;control your thoughts/temper. You can measure a person by what makes him/her angry. Little people get angry over little things. Big people are undisturbed and keep cool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;listen first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for areas of agreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks your opponents sincerely for their interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to give feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk about your own related mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask questions instead of giving orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give the person a fine reputation to live up to. Act as though the trait were already one of his/her outstanding characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let the other people save face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be specific with your compliments, and don’t give everyone the same compliments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frame the improvement in terms of the person’s interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;take an interest in Others’ Interests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dogs know by some divine instinct that you can make more friends in minutes by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in months of trying to get others interested in you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We gravitate to what feels real and lasting. We embrace those whose messaging offers a mutual benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you incorporate others’ interests into your own–not merely for clarifying your market or ascertaining your audience–you find that your interests are met in helping others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thoreau wrote, “Goodness is the only investment that never fails.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bottom line is that you must become genuinely interested in others before you can ever expect anyone to be interested in you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a simple reason for this phenomenon: when we smile, we are letting people know we are happy to be with them, happy to meet them, and happy to be interacting with them. They, in turn, feel happier to be dealing with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside of emoticons and emojis, there is only one medium in which you can convey a digital smile–your voice, whether it is written or spoken. How you write an email, your tone, and your chosen words are critical tools of friendliness and subsequent influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always begin and end the message on a positive note rather than on a pessimistic or detached one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous studies have shown that the physical act of smiling, even while on a phone call, actually improves the tone in which your words are conveyed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reign with Names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of defaulting to hollow, truncated greetings such as “Hey” or “Hi,” default to a greeting that uses the person’s name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen Longer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening’s power, like that of smiling, is strong. When you listen well, you make an instant impression and build a solid bridge for a lasting connection. Who can resist being around someone who suspends his thoughts to value yours?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss What Matters to Them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it comes to others, you must discuss what matters to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are ultimately building a community when you initiate interactions with what matters to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses call it a customer retention strategy, but it is best thought of as a lively, meaningful dialogue among a community of friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave Others a Little Better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small-picture thinking: the foundation of leaving others a little better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If our minds are focused only on big payoffs, we will overlook the small opportunities that make the biggest difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people make the mistake of equating inspiration with implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real key to winning friends and influencing people today, says Robbins, is “moving relationships from manipulative to meaningful. You can only do that by constantly adding meaning and value.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every interaction with his spouse sent her one of two messages–that she was the most important person in the world to him or that she wasn’t. He’d sent the latter message far too often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many ancient teachings converge on one thing: Don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want them to do to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Arguments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arguing with the other person will rarely get you anywhere; they usually end with each person more firmly convinced of his rightness. You may be right, dead right, but arguing is just as futile as if you were dead wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the end, you must value interdependence higher than independence and understand that deferential negotiation is more effective in the long run than a noncompliant crusade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Say, “You’re Wrong”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Negotiations become more productive,” concludes [Deepak] Malhotra, “when each party acknowledges that the other may have legitimate concerns.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Friendship that insists upon agreement on all matters is not worth the name,” exhorted Mahatma Gandhi. “Friendship to be real must ever sustain the weight of honest differences, however sharp they are.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We talk because we know something,” explained corporate behavioural specialist Esther Jeles in a recent interview. “Or we think we know something. Or, in the workplace, because there is an expectation that we ’should’ know something.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet by approaching a conversation with a blank slate, we take a humbler and more honest approach. We acknowledge the possibility that we may not know all the facts and may not be the only one who is right. Better yet, we create the possibility for meaningful collaboration–the melting of thoughts, ideas, and experiences into something greater than the sum of two parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telling people they are wrong will only earn you enemies. Few people respond logically when told they are wrong; most respond emotionally and defensively because you question their judgment. You shouldn’t just avoid the words “You’re wrong.” You can tell people they are wrong by a look, an intonation, or a gesture, so you must guard against showing judgment in all the ways you communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always default to diplomacy. Admit that you may be wrong. Concede that the other person may be right. Be agreeable. Ask questions. And above all, consider the situation from the other’s perspective and show that person respect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Admit Faults Quickly and Emphatically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’ve made a mistake, it is far better that you control the news being spread. Come clean quickly and convincingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we admit our faults immediately and emphatically, it is like shooting a full-page press release across the wires that confirms we genuinely care about the people we hurt, are humbled, and want to make things right. People rarely hold on to anger and disappointment when they see that we view ourselves and the situation properly. We are much more forgiving of those willing to come clean immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we’d all like our pre-mistake lives back after a mistake, we must remember that no one changed the circumstances but us. It is not others’ duty to give back the life we took from ourselves. Only we can get our life back. That always begins with admitting our faults quickly and emphatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Begin in a Friendly Way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are more inclined to agree with another person or see things from his perceptive when we have friendly feelings toward him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the initiation of interactions is concerned, no approach sets the tone more effectively than gentleness and affability, even if the other person is a source of pain, frustration, or anger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I do not like that man,” Abraham Lincoln once said. “I must get to know him better.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access Affinity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris Brogan talking of the blizzard of business rather than communication snowfall:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Conversations and relationships are based on several touches. In the traditional marketing and communication world, people would use each touch to ask for something, to issue a call to action. This isn’t how social networks work…They are there to permit you to reach someone who has opted into a relationship with you…It’s snowfall. Every individual flake doesn’t mean a lot, but the body of work can change everything.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrender the Credit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it’s easy to see why we want credit for successes we laboured, claiming the credit will never win you, friends. It will also diminish your influence quicker than just about any other action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either you can seek friendships with those who are already successful, or you can seek success with those who are already friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, no one but the originator remembers things such as whose idea it was, who spoke first, or who took the first risk. What people remember is magnanimity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage with Empathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Cooperativeness in conversation,” wrote Gerald S. Nirenberg, “is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appeal to Noble Motives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While relational improvement and business productivity are centrepieces of our lives, their importance exists because we long to be people who make a difference. Tapping this noble motive in those you’d like to influence can reap great rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To truly connect with people, you must celebrate their inherent dignity. Appeal to noble motives, and you can move the masses and yourself along with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share Your Journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More and more common–and commonly effective at building influential relationships–is the authentic intersection of personal and professional life. While this intersection will always have certain judicious boundaries, many of the historically businesslike boundaries have been lowered or removed altogether because most people have come to remember that all interactions- transactional or otherwise- ride on the short- and long-term success of all interactions–transactional or otherwise–rides on the depth of the relationship. The more a colleague, friend, or customer shares your journey, the more you can accomplish together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throw Down a Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to get the best out of yourself and others is to challenge and collide. While a life of permanent interpersonal pleasantries appears more comfortable and sounds more peaceful, a relationally complacent life is a fruitless life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also true, however, that the challenge itself is just as important as its response. Challenges that inspire and compel are very different from challenges that discourage and depress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;begin on a positive note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While a current relationship, whether between a company and its customers or between two individuals, might be strained or even in serious trouble, it does little good to start a conversation on a negative note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, begin a conversation with honest and genuine appreciation, be specific; the receiver will be more amenable to your ideas and less defensive or resistant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledge Your Baggage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It isn’t nearly so difficult to be open to a conversation that may include a discussion of your faults if the other person begins by humbly admitting that she, too, is far from impeccable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is lovely about this principle is that we all make mistakes and have an ample supply of stories to use when trying to put someone at ease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;call out mistakes quietly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaders of all kinds have a fantastic tool available for sending a subtle message about the behaviour they are trying to encourage. &lt;strong&gt;They simply have to model that behaviour themselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In life, sometimes mistakes are the by-product of extenuating circumstances. We don’t always fail at work because of incompetence. We can fail because our hearts and minds are not engaged due to problems at home or elsewhere. The leader understands that mistakes and failures surface from all corners of life and should be treated as isolated and redeemable instances rather than fatal flaws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is to your advantage to pull people out of their dejected state as quickly as possible. Do so by calling out their mistakes quietly and returning them to a place of confidence and strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ask questions instead of giving direct orders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable and reduces resentment, it often stimulates creativity and innovation in solving the problem. People are more likely to follow a new path if they feel that they have been involved in shaping it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most employees have a keen understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. While some may be obtuse, most, if you ask, will tell you exactly what you are thinking. Many organizational psychologists recommend instituting a self-appraisal stage in the review process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions allow you to create a conversation–in any medium–that can lead to a better place for all involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wouldn’t you rather be asked a question than be given an order?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigate Fault&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A technique Sutton calls “forgive and remember,” a critical path for learning from mistakes and changing behaviour. The technique was first described by Charles L. Bosk in his book &lt;em&gt;Forgive and Remember: Managing Medical Failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal is to help individuals achieve accountability while managing the existential problem of failure, a demoralizing inner battle for anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making it safe for them [employees] to fail is a sure way to ensure that they will more readily admit their mistakes, more quickly recover from them, and more fully learn from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Five actions that leaders can take to instill organizational resilience within their teams:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledge that failure happens&lt;/strong&gt;. Leaders can acknowledge failures quickly when they happen, but they can also discuss the likelihood of failures with their teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage dialogue to foster trust&lt;/strong&gt;. Discussing problems is the best way to learn from them and trim the seedlings before they become fully-grown catastrophes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separate the person from the failure&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than saying, “you failed,” say, “the project failed.” In most cases, that is the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn from your mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise, they are lost opportunities for learning and coaching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a risk-taking and failure system&lt;/strong&gt;. Being methodical about approaching risk and failure can help mitigate some emotional responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alberto Alessi, the great Italian designer, described his company’s approach to design as an effort to find the borderline between what is possible and what is not possible and design along it. The best designs fall right on the edge of the borderline, just this side of possible. That is the space of innovation, where we test our talents and grow as individuals. Of course, hugging the line means that you will often flop over it–you will fall into the realm of the impossible and fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnify Improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Praise and encouragement are the two essential elements of motivating any person to fulfill their potential, improve, or tackle change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Center for Management and Organization Effectiveness offers the following advice for praising those around you:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Deliver praise from your heart.”&lt;/strong&gt; Be genuine and sincere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Deliver praise as soon as possible.”&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t wait for the next meeting, performance review, or family meeting. By then, the person’s job at success has dissipated, and you’ve lost an opportunity to amplify that joy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Make praise specific.”&lt;/strong&gt; A simple thank-you note is not praised; it is politeness. To feel that their efforts are heading them down the path they want, people need to know exactly what you value in their effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Praise people publicly.”&lt;/strong&gt; Publicly praising people gets easier every day, so there is no real excuse not to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Praise, while powerful and necessary, also implies evaluation against some standard. What great leaders and those with influence recognize is that we must use encouragement the rest of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is the essence of encouragement–showing your belief in another person’s talents, skills, and inherent abilities because she exists, regardless of how things are going right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being encouraging requires a special attitude. When you look at another person, rather than seeing her faults, you need to be able to see her strengths and possibilities, what she is capable of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell someone that you have total faith in his ability to accomplish a goal and encourage him by highlighting all of the skills he possesses that will help him along the way, and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window to excel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnify improvement, and you maximize others’ talents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give Others a Fine Reputation to Live Up To&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coaches, mentors, leaders, and parents often find that people live up to our expectations of them, no matter how diminished those expectations are. If a man feels unimportant or disrespected, he will have little motivation to improve himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To change somebody’s behaviour, change the level of respect she receives by giving her a fine reputation to live up to. Act as though the trait you are trying to influence is already one of the person’s outstanding characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Connected on Common Ground&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is common ground so important? For a leader to effectively influence another’s attitude or behaviour, he needs to overcome potential resistance by making the person feel glad to do what is being asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why shouldn’t we know what our colleagues, coworkers, friends, and family dream of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be sincere&lt;/strong&gt; Do not promise anything you can not deliver. Forget about the benefits and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a simple process to link your desired outcomes with their goals:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be empathetic&lt;/strong&gt; ask yourself what it is the other person wants to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;consider the benefits&lt;/strong&gt; that person will receive from doing what you suggest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;match those benefits&lt;/strong&gt; to the other person’s wants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you make your request, put it in a form that will &lt;strong&gt;convey to the other person the idea that he will personally benefit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In digital time and space, with open access and frequent communication, the perfunctory principles of corporate activity have largely broken down and been replaced by the basic principles of human relations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your first task remains the business of humanity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment. … Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not logical, we’re emotional, motivated by pride and vanity”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: ‘Imay be wrong, I frequently am. Let’s examine the facts.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than condemn others, try to understand them. Try to figure out why they do what they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all want to be appreciated”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people. The greatest asset I possess and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the smallest dose that will deliver your intended result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to eliminate stored fat, perform a bare minimum to activate a fat-loss cascade of particular hormones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to build muscle in tiny or significant amounts, complete the bare minimum to activate local (muscle-specific) and systemic (hormonal) development processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical recreation is not exercise. &lt;strong&gt;Exercising involves performing MED to produce a targeted change&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Tracking = No awareness = No behavioural change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tracking the ratio of body composition and not weight. Ask yourself, &lt;strong&gt;“How much is a useful muscle, and how much is useful fat?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;four principles of failure proofing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make it conscious&lt;/strong&gt;, beware in real-time and not after the fact. For example, taking a picture of what you’re about to eat will make you think twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it a game&lt;/strong&gt;, measurement = motivation. Seeing any changes in numbers creates a positive feedback loop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make it competitive&lt;/strong&gt;, The potential loss is a more fantastic motivator than the potential reward. Use peer pressure to improve your performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make it minor and temporary&lt;/strong&gt;, ask yourself, “what is the smallest minimum change that I can make”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contracts to tie you to finish what you’ve started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of incentives for completing a task in its entirety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a diary. Maintaining a journal allows you to balance embracing the past and planning for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fasting is an excellent tool for stimulating concentration and metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make short fasts, consume all the foods of the day between 6 and 8 hours and then only feed again on the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both prevent chronic diseases and increase muscle mass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your body operates with ketones, you get a greater focus, more concentration and more energy because your blood sugar level stabilizes during ketosis.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eats a simple set of meals regularly. This will assist you in staying on track and preventing you from indulging in unhealthy food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concentrate on slow-burning carbohydrates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow one ‘cheat day’ every week to eat whatever you want. This includes even the most sinful treats. This will assist you in remaining motivated.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bread, potatoes, sweet potatoes, spaghetti, tortillas, fried meals, wholegrain carbohydrates such as brown rice, wholegrain bread, oats, quinoa, amaranth, starches, and sweets, sugar substitutes&lt;/strong&gt; must all be avoided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Splenda has no calories. It causes weight gain by raising the number of harmful bacteria in your stomach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fruits are high in vitamins, but they are also high in fructose. Avocados and tomatoes, in moderation, are exceptions to this rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lemons and limes are also beneficial to one’s overall health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dairy such as milk, yogurt, creams, and cheeses should be avoided at all costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the goal of this diet is to reduce blood sugar levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carbohydrates in the diet are converted into blood sugar, commonly known as glucose. Foods with a high glycemic index dramatically boost blood sugar levels, such as wheat, rice, and potatoes. Low-glycemic foods, such as vegetables and fish, have little impact on blood sugar levels. Glucose is required for all living things to survive, but excessive quantities cause weight gain, heart disease, and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the more muscle you have, the easier it is to keep the fat off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workout A. Make ten sets, each with thirteen reps and as much weight as possible, except for swings with the kettlebell. For the kettlebell, make 20 to 25 swings. Repeat the entire circuit twice:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squatting with dumbells, tighten buttocks at the bottom of the squat for one second before getting up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-sided paddle with two supports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step forward with a dumbbell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open-arm push-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swings with a kettlebell with both arms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;workout B:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slight incline/decline bench press x 7 (5/5 count)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leg press x 10 (5/count) (optional: kettlebell or T-bar swings)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stationary bike x 3 minutes at 85+ rpm (to minimize subsequent leg soreness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 6-minute ab workout is also a great way to lose extra fat.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;double crunch, Russian twist, v-ups, mountain climber, reverse crunch hip thrust, bear crawl hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEQ02magQik&amp;#x26;ab_channel=DaveDreas&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEQ02magQik&amp;#x26;ab_channel=DaveDreas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movement - your first port of call. Use developments to change your stance and activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulation repairs your harmed delicate tissue through pressure prompted by a machine or hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medication - take substance blends orally or through infusions if all else fails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical - this includes a medical procedure or something to that effect. This will not generally be fundamental, yet maybe for a few.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A whole-body practice was urged to inspire a maximal hormonal (testosterone, development chemical, and IGF-1) reaction. yet, you should likewise zero in on close to 5-7 multi-joint activities:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pullover + Yates’ bent row&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shoulder-width leg press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pec deck + weighted dips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leg curl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reverse thick bar curl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seated calf raise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manual neck resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;machine crunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the body burns more energy when subjected to cold temperatures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put an ice pack in your upper trapezius muscle area or behind the neck for about twenty minutes every morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink at least 500 ml of ice water as soon as you wake up before eating anything else. You should then have breakfast no more than half an hour later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take icy baths for 5-10 minutes in the morning or before bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit in an ice bath for 20 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cold baths have numerous benefits, including releasing fatty acids, increasing adiponectin, stimulating thermogenesis, improving your immune system, and an indirect treatment for depression.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;warm-up exercise help in muscle activation. An example of such an exercise is performing 5-second squats followed by jumps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Tabata protocol to increase endurance, rather than the standard guidance of running high volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This high-intensity interval training involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise with progressively quicker recovery.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid white carbohydrates, i.e. all bread, cereal, potatoes, pasta, and fried food with breading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eat the same meals over and over again. Foods that produce the fastest weight loss include proteins, legumes, and vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t drink calories instead, drink massive amounts of water, unsweetened tea, wine and low-calorie beverages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t eat fruit. You don’t need to eat fruit every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take one day off per week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example diet
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breakfast: one cup of coffee and one egg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lunch: fajita bowl (Onions, peppers, tomato salsa, tomatillo salsa, sour cream, romaine lettuce, steak, cheese)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dinner: fajita bowl (Onions, papers, tomato salsa, tomatillo salsa, sour cream, romaine lettuce, steak, cheese)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you NEED to snack between meals, carrots are the best thing to eat but do not eat too many&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only fruits allowed in the diet are tomatoes and avocado. Avocados should be limited to one unit per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;common mistakes to avoid&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not eating within an hour or 30 minutes of waking up and skipping breakfast will result in overeating in the evening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not eating enough protein eating proteins in the morning will curb your impulses to eat later and promote a negative fat balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not drink enough water - drinking enough water will ensure optimal liver function for fat loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;believing that you’ll cook, especially if you are a bachelor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mistiming weight loss with your menstrual cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overeating common foods: nuts, chickpeas, hummus, peanuts, macadamias. These foods are great on a diet but prone to portion abuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overconsuming artificial sweeteners - artificial sweeteners provoke increased insulin release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hitting the gym too often - doing too much can result in overeating and may reverse your progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;do four things: the squat, the bench, the deadlift, and compete in lifting competitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not attempt a rep unless you’re 100% sure you will make it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;hold the breath for an objective of brief 30 seconds&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It should produce a wise agreement if an agreement is possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it should be efficient&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it should improve or at least not damage the relationship between the parties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid establishing a “bottom line” (worst acceptable outcome) in an attempt to protect themselves against a poor agreement since it would limit/prevent creativity in generating options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concentrate on assessing BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;power in a negotiation comes from the ability to walk away from talks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weaker party will better understand the negotiation context if they also try to estimate the other side’s BATNA.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when to refuse to budge from their positions, asking for reasons behind that position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when attacking the other side’s ideas, should take it as constructive criticism and invite further feedback and advice. Personal attacks should be recast as attacks on the problem. Generally, the principled party should use questions and strategic silences to draw the other party out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brought in a third party to interview each side separately to determine each side’s interests individually. Then the third party assembles the list of both sides’ interests and asks each side for their comments and criticism of the list. Then the third party works with both sides to hash out the proposals iteratively.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such as good guy/bad guy routines, uncomfortable seating, and leaks to the media. This could be responded to by explicitly raising issues in negotiations and engaging in principled negotiation to establish procedural ground rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parties may deliberate deception about the phoney facts, their authority, and their intentions. Principled negotiators may seek verification other side’s claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another common tactic is psychological warfare, such as using stressful environments, subtle personal attacks. Instead, the principled party could identify the problematic element and suggest a fair change or simply recognize what they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positional pressure tactics attempt to structure negotiations so that only one side can make concessions. The principled party may decline to recognize the commitment or the finality of the offer, instead of treating them as proposals or expressed interests, insist that any recommendations be evaluated on their merits, and don’t hesitate to point out dirty tricks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to work through people problems, think in terms of perception, emotion, and communication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;perception&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#perception&quot; aria-label=&quot;perception permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Perception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most conflicts are based on differing interpretations of the facts. Stick to the facts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;both sides must understand the other viewpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should not assume that their worst fears will become the other party’s actions. Nor should one side blame the other for their problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give them a stake in the outcome by letting them participate in the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make your proposal consistent with their values, and let them save face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;emotion&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#emotion&quot; aria-label=&quot;emotion permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Emotion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recognize and understand the feelings of all parties and the source of the feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t react to an emotional outburst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use symbolic gestures (gift-giving, etc…) to show empathy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make emotions explicit and acknowledge them as legitimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, allow the other side to let off steam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#communication&quot; aria-label=&quot;communication permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;employ active listening, such as giving speakers their full attention and acknowledging what is said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally, summarizing the speaker’s point to confirm their understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to remember that understanding the other’s case does not mean agreeing with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speakers should focus on communicating the intent and reasonings of themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid blaming and attacking the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak to be understood. You’re not trying to persuade some third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speak about yourself, not about them. However, it is more persuasive to describe a problem in terms of its impact on you and in words of what they did and why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the best way to deal with people’s problems is to prevent them from arising. People’s problems are less likely to come up if parties have a good relationship and think of each other as partners in negotiation rather than adversaries. Asks for help give the other party the comfortable feeling of knowing that someone owed them a favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a problem is defined in terms of the parties’ underlying interests, it is often possible to find a solution that satisfies both parties’ interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be hard on issues but soft on people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your positions are something you have decided upon. Your interests are what caused you to choose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to identify interests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask “why?” put yourselves in their shoes and try to figure out how they arrived at their positions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask “why not?” what interests of theirs stand in the way of your decision? Why do they not want what you want?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most powerful interests are basic human needs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic well-being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sense of belonging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control over one’s life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify shared interests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shared interests are latent in every negotiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stressing your shared interests can make the negotiation smoother and more amicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;create first, decide later. Separating the act of inventing options from the act of judging them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for items of low cost to you and high benefits to them and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;agree first on principles. Before even considering possible terms, you may want to decide on the standard or standards to apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never yield to pressure, only to the principal. When pressured, invite them to state their reasoning, suggest objective criteria that you think apply, and refuse to budget except on this basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the other parties’ reasoning to support your position can be a powerful way to negotiate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willing to reconsider their positions when there is reason to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frame each issue as a search for objective criteria&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/consequences-of-dependency-inversion-principle&quot;&gt;move implementation choices up the call stack&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when we push implementation details up the call stack, we leave behind the minimum context needed to do the work. This makes the code as reusable as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;injecting an interface up front is &lt;em&gt;making a guess&lt;/em&gt; about the minimum context needed inside the method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overtime, to make the tests “better”, we extract details up into parameters. And then sometimes we extract interfaces on those new parameters. This is “fine tuning” the interactions between objects, gradually/relentlessly removing irrelevant details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the progress is usually similar to:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;function contains implementation details, forcing us into integrated tests (Example: database access inside domain code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extract and inject implementation details, which improves the design but often doesn’t make the tests nicer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extract interfaces on the implementation detail parameters, which makes the tests nicer (Example: replace database access with repository pattern)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invert the dependency, so that hte client knows there is database access. Client “injects” the data instead of the source of the data. (Example: replace repository pattern with Logic Sandwich/impure-pure-impure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DIP encourage us to isolate the steps from the workflow. This generally makes it easier to rearrange the steps into new workflows (new features are less expensive to build), but perhaps, more importantly, this makes it safer to reimplement some Steps to take advantage of distributed computing and parallelization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t instantiate the service if you can get your caller to do that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/consequences-of-dependency-inversion-principle&quot;&gt;move specificity towards the tests&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as the tests get more specific, the code get more generic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid call your dependency injection container from production code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“when in doubt, inject each dependency directly in the method that requires it”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“only when you inject the same dependency into multiple methods of the same class, move the parameter into the constructor”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“when a constructor parameter list becomes uncomfortably long, split the class so that the new classes’ constructors don’t overlap”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“if you notice a class using the same dependency through 2 different object graph routes, split the class so that the new class receive the dependency directly in their constructors”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“if you notice a class using groups of dependencies at different times, split the class, so that the new classes only use each cohesive group of dependencies”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“depends on things that change less often than you do”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some classes are more likely than other to have changes in requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concrete classes are more likely to change than abstract classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changing a class that has many dependencies will result in widespread consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an object has a dependency when it knows
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name of another class. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gear&lt;/code&gt; expects a class named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Wheel&lt;/code&gt; to exist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name of a message that it intends to send to someone other than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the arguments that a message requires &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gear knows that Wheel.new requires rim and title.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mostly unavoidable dependency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the order of those arguments &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gear knows the first argument to Wheel.new should be rim, tire the second&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dependencies cause these objects to act like a single thing. They move in lockstep; they change together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“some degree of dependency is inevitable, however, most dependencies are unnecessary”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;violate law of demeter (know too much internals of distant objects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests that tightly-coupled to code???&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trade argument order dependency for an argument name dependency
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;argument name is more stable and provides explicit documentation of arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for simple methods, you’re better off accepting the argument order dependency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for complex method signatures, hashes fit better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;there are some cases in between where some arguments are required as stable (dependent on order) and some are less stable or optional (dependent on names by hash).&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;defaults&lt;/code&gt; method is an independent method that handles the complex logic for defaults and returns a hash. This hash is then merged to teh actual arguments hash.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depend on things that change less often than you do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some classes are more likely to have changes in requirements compared to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concrete classes are more likely to change than abstract classes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abstract class: disassociated from any specific instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changing a class that has many dependents will result in widespread consequences, which would increase risks and fear in changing the class.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Dependency parameterization, in which we pass in all dependencies as parameters. This is commonly used in conjunction with partial application.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in which we pass in dependencies after the rest of the code has already been constructed. This is typically done via constructor injection in OO-style code, and in FP-style principle, this corresponds to the Reader monad.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We replace calls to dependencies with a data structure interpreted later. This approach is used in both OO (interpreter pattern) and FP (e.g. free monads)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;success, however you define it, is achievable if you collect the right field-tested beliefs and habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the superheroes you have in your mind (idols, icons, titans, billionaires, etc.) are nearly all walking flaws who’ve maximized 1 or 2 strengths)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what might you do to accomplish your 10-year goals in the next six months if you had a gun against your head?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;routine, in an intelligent man, is a sign of ambition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn things once and use them forever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a toolkit for changing your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;judge a man by his questions rather than his answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it contains low-hanging fruit with immediate returns. Think of the bite-sized rules within these pages as PED(s) - performance-enhancing details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for the black sheep who fit your unique idiosyncrasies. Keep an eye out for the non-traditional paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this book is a buffet. Here’s how to get the most out of it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;skip liberally: skip anything that doesn’t interest you.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;like 50%, love 25%, and never forget 10%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skip, but do so intelligently
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return to it later and ask yourself, “why did I skip this?” Did it offend you? Seem beneath you? Seem too difficult? And did you arrive at that by thinking it through, or is it a reflection of biases inherited from your parents and others? very often, “our” beliefs are not our own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This practice is how you create yourself instead of discovering yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the context and original language teach you how to THINK like a world-class performer, not just regurgitate quotes. That is the crucial meta-skill we’re aiming for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 tools that allow all the rest&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can think: of having good rules for decision-making and having good questions you can ask yourself and others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can wait: being able to plan the long-term, play the long game, and not misallocate your resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can fast: being able to withstand difficulties and disaster. Training yourself to be uncommonly resilient and have a high pain tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferriss emphasizes the importance of exercising to improve fitness, never hurting yourself, and don’t go overboard. Working out somewhere with a soft surface is recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consistency is what’s important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AcroYoga helps relax, loosen the muscles and prepare the body for sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training the areas of weakness is the area that causes the most physical pain. Thus, the body and mind must be prepared to deal with chronic pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle strength workouts stabilize the body’s metabolism, bone health, and immune system. Gaining strength in these areas creates a sense of confidence to continue strength training, flexibility and endurance in others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommend exercises like races, jumps, and squats for pure muscle extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sneakers have slight heel rises, which causes them to extend the Achilles heel and affect the ankle’s mobility. So you should avoid them. Instead, wear sneakers with flat soles and keep your toes and heels aligned at the same height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard mattresses keep your muscles extended. Soft beds are best for modern humans sitting in an office or car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ideal place to sleep is in a hammock. Try an acupressure mattress, which helps relieve back pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;daily simple strength exercise:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one-arm kettlebell swing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turkish kettlebell get-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kettlebell goblet squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combining exercises with Breathing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do as many pushups as possible in one set. Stop short of failure. Note down how many you did and rest for 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the following 40 times: maximum inhale followed by a ‘let go’ exhale - dropping your chest sharply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on the final round, inhale, exhale, then do another set of pushups. See if you can do more pushups after this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mobility&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mobility&quot; aria-label=&quot;mobility permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mobility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires that you demonstrate strength throughout the entire range of motion, including the end ranges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kelly Starrett: try squatting to the ground while keeping your feet and knees together. This indicates your mobility in the motion range in your hip and ankle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommend doing light, narrow-stance overhead squats in combination with cossack squats as a way of improving your mobility in these areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the heels flat on the ground, your knees directly above your toes, and your hips as close to the ground as possible when you switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cow stretch (aka cat-cow or cat camel in yoga). Spend as much time as you can in a low lunge and work on shoulder rotation using the Burgener warm-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hyperthermic conditioning, aka calculated heat exposure.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It probably would improve your endurance and increase your GH (growth hormone levels).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular saunas post-workout. Just 20 minutes 3-4 times a week at a temperature of 160-170 F can be highly beneficial for reducing DOMS (delayed-onset muscle soreness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cold therapy to improve immunity and mood and increase fat loss.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start small, and end your shower with 30-60 seconds of pure cold water. Then, gradually increase the time spent under cold water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drinking a large amount of water daily to maintain optimum health. Add a pinch of salt to your water to aid with hydration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use manuka honey bandages for treating wounds. Manuka honey is very expensive, produced only in Australia and New Zealand, and evaluated by medicine to improve the immune system and prevent colds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oolong tea, the goto kola leaf liquid extract, is believed to have the power to improve stretch marks and cellulite on the body, and the Hitachi magic wand vibrator, is used to soothe muscles.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;eating ‘pop tarts’ cookies for breakfast before competitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people should only eat carbohydrates or sugars if they have a good body mass index. A person should have less than 10% body fat&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the low-carb and ketogenic diet for optimum health
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the keto diet is essentially a low-carb, high-fat diet designed to imitate the state of fasting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than using blood sugar (glucose) as your energy source, the body becomes dependent on ketones derived from fat. Few benefits are fat loss, better body composition, potential anti-cancer effects, improvement of oxygen consumption, and increased overall strength and health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the same low-carb meals regularly. For example, have the same thing for breakfast every day, do the same for lunch, and if you require some variation, you can mix up your dinners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never drink calories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid fruit, too many sugars in fruit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure your body fat percentage. If you can see this dropping, then you’re on the right track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take one day off per week and eat whatever you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fasting can help re-setting your body and immune system, stimulating stem-cell regeneration. It is recommended to try a 5-day fast 2-3 times per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;intermittent-fasting&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#intermittent-fasting&quot; aria-label=&quot;intermittent fasting permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Intermittent fasting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eats one meal a day in a four-hour window, followed by twenty hours of fasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This strategy is in line with the ketogenic diet, in which the body begins to use stored fat as an energy source rather than using glucose. This results in burning body fat and increased ability to gain muscle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intermittent fasting helps to expel cancer cells from the body. However, ketogenic diets are about 80% fat, and you should avoid starches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exogenous ketones are also recommended: supplements that help the body achieve or maintain the highest performing ketogenic states. However, these supplements are costly and can induce nausea and induce vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;make your bed daily. By making your bed, you’re working on your first task of the day, and achieving this will inject you with pride. This will motivate you to continue in the same manner throughout your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate. Aim for 10-20 minutes per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than a minute of exercise. Upon walking, smash out 5-10 reps of something, whether press-ups, squats, or sit-ups. This isn’t considered a workout but can significantly affect blood flow and mood improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make ‘titanium tea.’ Ingredients: Pu-Erh-aged black tea. Dragon well green tea (or other green tea). Turmeric and ginger shavings (often also Rishi brand). Add hot water and steep for 1-2 minutes. Once done, add 1-2 tbsp of coconut oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;journal. Take 5-10 minutes to write down some thoughts. Then, answer a few questions about what you’re grateful for, what would make the day better, and daily affirmations.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;should not undervalue your product and not charge enough. By not charging enough for a product, you’re only undercutting yourself. You’re left with not enough money actually to market the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know the value of what you are selling. Don’t get greedy and aim for volume.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;when you’re earlier in your career, the best strategy is to say ‘yes’ to every little gig. You never know what the lottery tickets are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t instinctively think, “HELL, YES, I WILL DO THAT,” then say ‘no.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you’ve found your rhythm and made progress, it’s time to stop filling your time with menial and mediocre tasks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;being busy means lacking priorities, so commit to things worth it and reject the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Being busy is most often used as a guide for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;what if mindset, anything you do, anything you change, consider the possible results of that in one day, one week, one month, or one year? Always be thinking ahead and have a plan for success.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;obsession with not losing money. Before entering any business opportunity or investment, ask yourself what the downside is and how you can be protected against it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obsessed with asymmetrical risk and reward. This essentially means that they are focused on minimum risk with maximum results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset allocation and margin of safety to diversify your portfolio in case you make wrong decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passionate about giving and being generous. It wasn’t tight or overly frugal.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;start by exploring an idea emotionally, than do traditional due diligence using objective data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Most startups will fail. So to cover your losses, you need to ensure that the successes are worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it comes to investing and angel investments, you must be 100% comfortable losing all of your money. Therefore, you should only gamble with an amount you can afford to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit angel investment funds to 10-15% of your liquid assets. Nevermore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When designing a product, you must be keen to use the product yourself. If it’s not something you’re interested in, avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by focusing on ‘systems’ rather than ‘goals,’ you allow yourself to improve your skills and relationship without focusing too much on the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and improve transferable skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t treat your systems as a binary pass/fail situation. Instead, consider systems as something that can have a snowball effect.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;either be the best at one specific thing or be very good (top 25%) at two or more items. The first option is almost impossible, which few people will ever achieve. But the second strategy is simple and something everyone is capable of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add public speaking as one of your two (or more) skills, combining being an excellent public speaker with any other skill, and you have the recipe for some pretty decent success.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in business, you have to get comfortable asking for things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confident enough to put yourself out there. The following 5-6 times you order a coffee, ask for 10% off. Doing this a few times will improve your confidence and help you get comfortable with asking.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;before releasing a product or service, exposing them to proper scrutiny is essential. For example, select the first ten people (red team) to critique and break an idea apart.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s what you do consistently.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge is redundant without consistent, purposeful action. A similar theme addressed by Peter Thiel is that education does not equate to learning. Thiel is more interested in what people learn rather than what educational credentials they are working on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero to one questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The monopoly question&lt;/strong&gt;: are you starting with a significant share of a small market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The secret question&lt;/strong&gt;: have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The distribution question&lt;/strong&gt;: do you have a way not just to create but deliver your product?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;preparing for the worst conditions enables individuals to stand up when faced with failures and falls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guru Tony Robbins has a great morning routine for developing strength. His method involves diving into the ice water for 30 to 90 seconds. That prepares his body to take action and trains his mind. When it says it will do something, such as entering an icy river, it doesn’t matter if it will feel uncomfortable. He can do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing Tetris between 6-24 hours after a traumatic episode helps prevent post-traumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related problems. In addition, Tetris is a visual replacement strategy that helps with other obsessions, addictions, eating compulsions and insomnia.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everyone wants freedom, but few people have the discipline to reach it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the modern world of technology, social networking and unlimited distractions, the ability to focus on a single task is a “superpower.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some progression in flexibility and mobility can only be achieved by regular physical exercise rather than intensity.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose a particular goal you want to achieve and write that goal on a piece of paper 15 times daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The important thing is not the method but its focus and commitment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By focusing your memory and mind on a particular goal, you’re utilizing a part of your brain known as the reticular activation system. As a result, the universe begins to send opportunities he never imagined, things he saw as coincidences but which continued to happen.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to make money, you only need 1000 true fans. A “true fan” is someone who will buy everything you produce. It is important to differentiate that this approach will help you make money but not a fortune.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fear is designed to keep us safe.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to embrace fear, you must define the worst-case scenario for any event or outcome. Understand precisely what would happen and identify how you might be affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By defining your fears, you’ll find that you’re working towards conquering these fears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate the negative outcome on a scale of 1-10 and consider whether they are permanent or temporary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, consider what actions you would take to correct the adverse outcomes. Finally, how easy would it be to get back on track?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost-benefit analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In other words, you’re risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a probable and permanent 9 or 10.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t focus on how many people don’t get it or don’t get you. Focus on how many people do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expect that people will take things personally. 10% of people will find a way to take anything personally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when in doubt - starve it of oxygen (ignore it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t over-apologize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t reason someone out of something they didn’t reason themselves into&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t try to get everyone to like you. Confront the people who need confronting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;living well is the best revenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“the most important trick to being happy is realizing that happiness is a choice you make and a skill you develop. You choose to be happy, and then you work at it. It’s just like building muscles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90% of our thoughts are based on our fears. Which only leaves 10% left for focusing on desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire is your commitment to being unhappy until you get what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you spend your day desiring things you don’t have, you’re destined to be disappointed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So select your desires carefully and only have one big desire at any time to maintain a sense of peace. On the other hand, if you have too many desires at one time, then unhappiness is inevitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an obsession with yourself is a constant cause of suffering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice kindness, in which you desire the happiness of others, and in return, you feel happier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice saying the words “I love you” in her mind whenever she meets a stranger before she even talks to them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This practice is a way of ensuring that she is not judged negatively. Criticism and negative judgement are a way to feel superior while avoiding introspection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seeks to be the first to smile at someone and say ‘hello’ - to friends and even strangers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Happiness is wanting what you have.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when facing a new situation, there are three options: you can change it, accept it, or leave it. It’s essential to choose one of these options and not the terrible fourth option: sitting around, wishing you could change it, but simply accepting it, or wishing you could leave it, but changing it, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;training hard, then having a de-load week where the volume and intensity reduced significantly. It’s about using this as downtime for the body to recover and prepare for the next intensity period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferriss explains that he’ll batch an intense period of complex and similar tasks such as podcasting, emails, writing blogs and accounting. He’ll then alternate this with scheduled periods of downtime where he can do whatever he wants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Deloading blocks must be scheduled and defended more strongly than your business commitments. The former can strengthen and inform the latter, but not vice versa.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meditation practice is typically recommended in the morning routine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditation has been associated with a wide range of physiological and mental benefits, including lower blood pressure, improved cognition and lower levels of anxiety&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;busy is a sign that your mind is out of control and chaotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being available and having time for others and yourself means that you are in control of your day and life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chronic culture of occupation reflects the lack of priorities and the lack of self-respect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 minutes a day is all you need to be efficient, and being busy is not a valid excuse because if you do not have 10 minutes, you do not have a life.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reality is largely negotiable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if you stress-test the boundaries and experiment with the “impossible,” you’ll quickly discover that most limitations are a fragile collection of socially reinforced rules you can choose to break at any time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I did the opposite for 48 hours?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I did the opposite of all the other sales guys for 48 hours?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I only asked questions instead of pitching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what if I studied technical material, so I sounded like an engineer instead of a sales guy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what if I ended my emails with, “I understand if you’re too busy to reply, and thank you for reading this far,”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do I spend a silly amount of money on? How might I scratch my itch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would I do/have/been if I had $10 million? What’s my real TMI (target monthly income)?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/lifestyle-costing/&quot;&gt;life style costing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the worst things that could happen? Could I get back here?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/&quot;&gt;fear setting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would I do if I could only work 2 hours per week on my business?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80% (or more) of your desired outcomes result from 20&amp;#x26;(or less) of your activities and inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What 20% of customers/products/regions produce 80% of the profit?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting 90% of retail customers on autopilot with simple terms and standardized order processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what if I let them make decisions up to $100? $500? $1000?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get huge, good things done, you need to be okay with letting the small, bad things happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people’s IQs seem to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the least six minor crowded channels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine if I couldn’t pitch my product directly?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don’t like being sold products, but we all want to be told stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what if I created my real-world MBA?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2010/06/28/mba/&quot;&gt;my real-world MBA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do I need to make it back the way I lost it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I could only subtract to solve problems?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should we simplify?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I put on my not-to-do list?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What might I put in place to allow me to go off the grid for 4-8 weeks without phone or email?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It forces you to put systems and policies in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empower other people with rules and tools, separate the critical few from the trivial many&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hunting antelope or field mice?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which one of these, if done, would render all the rest either easier or completely irrelevant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could it be that everything is fine and complete as is?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivating more daily appreciation and present state awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have to want what you already have&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would this look like if it were easy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I throw money at this problem? How can I “waste” money to improve the quality of my life?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’ve got enough money to solve the problem, you don’t have the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spend money to earn time as time is non-renewable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No hurry, no pause.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get 95% of the desired results by calmly putting one foot in front of the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luxury is feeling unrushed. No hurry, no pause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;an old relationship that really helped you or valued highly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an opportunity you have today. Perhaps that’s just an opportunity to call one of your parents or a chance to go to work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something significant that happened yesterday, whether you experienced or witnessed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something simple near you or within sight.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tonight or tomorrow morning, think of a decision you’ve been putting off and challenge the fuzzy “what ifs” holding you hostage. If not now, when? If left at the status quo, what will your life and stress look like in 6 months? In 1 year? In 3 years? Who around you will also suffer?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Learn to confront the challenges of the real world, rather than report to the protective womb of academia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am a big believer that if you have an obvious vision of where you want to go, the rest of it is much easier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you’re thinking of how to make your business bigger, it’s tempting to try to think all the big thoughts, the world-changing, massive-action plans. But please know that it’s often the tiny details that thrill someone enough to make them tell all their friends about you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you would not want to be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading or do things worth writing.” - Ben Franklin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What is the ultimate quantification of success? For me, it’s not how much time you spend doing what you love. It’s how little time you spend doing what you hate.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once we get those muddy, maddening, confusing thoughts [nebulous worries, jitters, and preoccupations] on the page, we face our day with clearer eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I have come to learn that part of the business strategy is to solve the simplest, easier, and most valuable problem.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“So if you’re planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10-year plan of how to get there, you should ask: Why can’t you do this in 6 months?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are no actual rules, so make rules that work for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only have one skill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“At the end of the day, who cares? What’s the big deal? I’m here, I’m going to try my best, and I’m going to go home, and my family’s there. Even though my whole world’s wrapped up in this, who cares?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greatness comes from humble beginnings. It comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room - until you change that with results. There is an old saying, “say little, do much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Truth is, young creative minds don’t need more ideas. Instead, they need to take more responsibility with the ideas they’ve already got.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In reality, long-term travel has nothing to do with demographics - age, ideology, income - and everything to do with personal outlook. Long-term travel isn’t about being a college student - it’s about being a student of daily life. Long-term travel doesn’t require a massive “bundle of cash”; it requires only that we walk through the world more deliberately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more freedom to be gained from practicing poverty than chasing wealth. Suffer a little regularly, and you often cease to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life is not waiting for the storm to pass. Instead, it’s learning how to dance in the rain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Accept reality, but focus on the solution. Take that issue, take that setback, take that problem, and turn it into something good. Go forward. If you’re part of a team, that attitude will spread throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ours is a culture where we wear the ability to get by on very little sleep as a kind of badge of honour that symbolizes work ethic, or toughness or some other virtue - but really, it’s a total profound failure of priorities and self-respect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Titans create their own rules, which allow them to transform their reality according to their will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Everyone wants freedom, but few people have the discipline to reach it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“overestimate what we can accomplish a day, underestimate what we can accomplish in a year.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“focus on small daily actions that compound over a long time.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when in doubt, zoom out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it’s scary to put yourself out there, to expose yourself, to become vulnerable, but it makes all the differences. Be a man, woman in the arena. When you let your mind wander in its truly natural state, good things happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;want to get unstuck, go for a walk, no phone, no music, no podcast, just you, your thought and the fresh air.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“be deliberate about what you spend your time on and who you spend it with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“not matter how far you go, always remember, you didn’t make it on your own, pay it forward, be a mentor, be a champion for others, their growth should be your tremendous source of joy and pride.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Productivity is for robots. What humans are going to be good at is asking questions, being creative, and experiencing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;judge a person by his/her questions rather than his/her answers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“my goal for each reader to like 50%, love 25%, and never forget 10%.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Success, however you define it, is achievable if you collect the right field-tested beliefs and habits.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The superheroes you have in your mind (idols, icons, titans, billionaires, etc…) are nearly all walking flaws who’ve maximized 1 or 2 strengths…; you succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not the strongest. I’m not the fastest. But I’m good at suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone fighting a battle that you know nothing about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Routine, in an intelligent man, is a sign of ambition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;very often, “our” beliefs are not our own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I become less competitive in order that I can become more successful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me something that’s true that very few people agree with you on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the legacy system already has an established model, albeit implicit, which can seldom be changed with a reasonable effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simply adding objects that express a distinct model without changing the ones already there will lead to conflicting rules and concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing a complex new set of development principles and techniques is best done incrementally as in a pilot project, in a way that allows members of the team to gain experience and allows the organization to assess the approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This pilot project allows a small team to achieve a modest objective involving some complex domain logic and, ideally, one with some strategic value that is difficult to solve in a legacy context. Therefore, it is recommended to cherry-pick a small, self-disciplined team with control over its code to evolve a model that addresses the chosen area, relatively unconstrained by the concepts of the legacy systems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new functionality does not disappear. It will continue to be maintained as an extension of the legacy systems. The organization now has the experience to undertake more ambitious use of DDD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no synchronization risk (uses a legacy database)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;works when there is a limited range of data needed from legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A ‘bubble’ is a small bounded context established using an Anticorruption Layer (ACL) for the purpose of a particular development effort and not intended necessarily to be expanded or used for a long time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACL should be explicitly addressed in budgeting and planning. It should be designed to keep it decoupled from the actual business logic of the new system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good anti-corruption layer has a clean interface entirely in terms of the downstream model (in our case, the bubble model) that provides access to the information and services of the upstream system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACL allows development in the downstream context to focus on the business problem and not be distracted or complicated by dealing with the other system’s distinct concepts and quirks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any new information needed from the legacy context requires incorporating the new data into the bubble model, working out the mapping from the old model, and then the ACL. That’s a high price, so we should choose functionality valuable enough to justify it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development in the bubble could go on for several months or, occasionally, in cases where the interface with other contexts is relatively narrow for a few years. However, it will not last forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bubble becomes the primary context for more ambitious new development. When this happens, the limitations of the bubble context may be judged unacceptable, and the strategy migrates to the autonomous bubble with synchronizing ACL. Then the bubble transforms into something more long-lasting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;strategy-2-autonomous-bubble&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#strategy-2-autonomous-bubble&quot; aria-label=&quot;strategy 2 autonomous bubble permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;strategy 2: autonomous bubble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The autonomous bubble is distinguished by the ability to run its software, for a time, cut off from other systems. Information may start to get stale, requests to external service requests start to queue up unfulfilled, but the internal behaviour of the software continues to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;needs organization committed to significant new development with a unique design approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows new data to be collected and used without involving legacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows decoupled “product” to evolve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;may progress from a bubble context as development is scaled up on a successful pilot project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable autonomous context having its own data, ACL takes on the responsibility of synchronization between data stores in 2 contexts, which do not depend directly on each other. This ACL activity is asynchronous with any action in either context, with a service level agreement (SLA) regarding the freshness of the translated data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this could involve importing data from a file, kicking off a SQL script, taking data from one table, transforming it, and inserting it into another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SLA: open of business, next business day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unnecessary coupling: synchronizing ACL mixed in with once-per-day business logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unnecessary coupling: multiple ACL(s) to various contexts lumped together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make sure you isolate the data copying and translation for your particular context into modules (one per context you are drawing on)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This approach can support a range of SLA(s) and update a system while it is being used, while - batch scripts typically run while systems are off-line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any information crossing a context boundary must be translated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messages are always expressed in some language based on some system of abstractions (a model), and we should not let them enter a context that uses a different vocabulary and model.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In the Bubble context, any new information that does not already exist in the legacy system somewhere must be added to the legacy system somewhere, even though it will not be used there! Then it must be mapped into the bubble context, increasing the dependency between the two systems. Clearly, this is not the strategy to introduce crucial new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development in the autonomous bubble is not so tightly bound to the older contexts. Therefore, the model in this context can be more innovative and trow more freely, and a fresh new product can be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one of the main challenges of SOA is the lack of attention to bounded contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with the legacy system, every new development effort gets dragged back into the old concepts and potentially tangled into the old implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy assets were developed with a particular feature set in mind and are highly coupled to those features. This makes it hard to access what you want directly without going through layers designed for a very different purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open host service over anticorruption layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commons Context, the most basic and widely used information, can be interchanged throughout the organization via one standard interchange model, the “Tragedy of the Commons.” But, unfortunately, the commons are prone to dumping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FIX has a way of describing an enormous range of financial trades and transactions and is used to interchange data between all sorts of organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a focused language, crafted for a modest suite of related services, usually gives the most satisfying balance between the fragmentation of the one-off service model and the total unification of the commons and the industry-standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we should get over the attitude that the ultimate goal is to eventually replace these older systems. That is a futile treadmill. Creating a bubble can allow you to selectively move responsibilities for the core domain, where you want to innovate, out into a new context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open host services over an ACL can give convenient, decoupled access to functionality and data assets embedded in the older systems. Once the legacy system is stable, not responsible for the core domain, and provides access to assets, why not let it be? You have better things to do right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one challenge that is particularly acute in a bubble is how critical it is to coordinate the incremental development of the new business functionality and the anticorruption layer in parallel. This affects the design and the planning of the sequence in which the features are written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design freedom is the point of a bubble, the bubble context with an umbilical ACL gives a little freedom, while the autonomous bubble can give a lot if properly managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things to think about for ACL
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does the new feature draw on information that is already being brought in by the existing anti-corruption layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will it require new mapping of legacy information? what is the scope of that work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if multiple features were chosen for the iteration call for new mapping, are they drawing on the same information, or does each call for different information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to make development manageable, the priority of business features must be balanced with the need to group work on features that use similar legacy data sets, with parallel planning of the necessary enhancements to the anticorruption layer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if not careful, the bulk of the project’s effort will go into implementing a big translator interface, each element of which is only sparsely used. This gives a low ROI for the context boundary, and eventually an unsustainable maintenance burden. Or developers would take shortcuts by making sloppy mappings or simply bypassing the ACL, pull the data they need directly from the legacy system, and the context boundary will erode and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the developers working on various features all drawing that same data can collaborate to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;model the new information by adding concepts to the bubble context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extend the ACL to bring in the new information. (This should be an explicit development task, not just part of a ‘user story’)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to reuse the fields/data from legacy without a mapping is a mistake. The concept represented by those fields was never mapped to a concept in the downstream context. We have no idea what they mean in the downstream context or how they relate to other concepts in the downstream model. It creates bigger objects with more dependencies and that is poorly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you must make choice, try to make the bubble’s model capable of expressing the essential meaning of the new information in terms consistent with the other concepts of that model. It is inadvisable to load objects down with information that does not directly pertain to their jobs, so it is best to do a bit more modelling work to find good homes for the new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bypass the context altogether, give the client access to the context where the information originated or pass it some other way (particularly when the new data is for display only) Sometimes this is a good time to expose a legacy asset with a service as in Strategy 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pass the information unchanged through new context. (Not recommended) since you have bored a tunnel through your anticorruption layer and compromised your ability to evolve your new model independently of the legacy system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;adding data is a modelling job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a way of referring to some aspect of some business situation, and the goal when translating this new element into your bubble context is to enrich the ubiquitous language to be able to express these concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explore new scenarios in the DDD modelling whirlpool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in order to pull in more data to use in logic or key definitions in your context, you should follow the whirlpool steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hammer out a reference scenario that illustrates why you need a new information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brainstorm model changes that incorporate that information organically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;context boundary leakage gets out of hand quickly and suddenly you may wake up to realize that your new software is conforming to the legacy model and does not give the desired fresh start for the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain-Driven Design is an approach to the development of complex software in which we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the core domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore the models in a creative collaboration of domain practitioners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;speak a ubiquitous language within an explicitly bounded context.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bounded-context&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bounded-context&quot; aria-label=&quot;bounded context permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bounded Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explicitly define the context within which a model applies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explicitly set boundaries in team organization, usage within specific application parts, and physical manifestations such as code bases and database schemas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply continuous integration to keep the model concepts and terms strictly consistent within these bounds, but don’t be distracted or confused by issues outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ubiquitous-language&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ubiquitous-language&quot; aria-label=&quot;ubiquitous language permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ubiquitous Language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the model as the backbone of a language. Then, commit the team to exercise that language relentlessly in all communication within the team and in the code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the same language in diagrams, writing, and speech within a bounded context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize that a change in the language is a change to the model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iron out difficulties by experimenting with alternative expressions, which reflect alternative models. Then refactor the code, renaming classes, methods, and modules to conform to the new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolve confusion over terms in conversation, in just the way we come to agree on the meaning of ordinary words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tightly relating the code to an underlying model gives the code meaning and makes the model relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design a portion of the software system to reflect the domain model literally so that the mapping is obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revisit the model and modify it to be implemented more naturally in software, even as you seek to make it reflect deeper insight into the domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demand a single model that serves both purposes well, in addition to supporting a ubiquitous fluent language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any technical person contributing to the model must spend some time touching the code, whatever primary role they play on the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone responsible for changing code must learn to express a model through the code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every developer must be involved in discussing the model and contact domain experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who contribute in different ways must consciously engage those who touch the code in a dynamic exchange of model ideas through the ubiquitous language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isolate the expression of the domain model and the business logic, and eliminate any dependency on infrastructure, user interface, or even application reason that is not business logic. Concentrate all the code related to the domain model in one layer and isolate it from the user interface, application, and infrastructure code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The domain objects, free of the responsibility of displaying themselves, storing themselves, managing application tasks, and so forth, can be focused on expressing the domain model.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This allows a model to evolve to be rich enough and clear enough to capture essential business knowledge and put it to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an object is distinguished by its identity rather than its attributes, make this primary to its definition in the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the class definition simple and focused on life cycle continuity and identity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a means of distinguishing each object regardless of its form or history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be alert to requirements that call for matching objects by attributes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define an operator that is guaranteed unique. This means of identification may come from the outside, or it may be an arbitrary identifier created by and for the system. Still, it must correspond to the identity distinctions in the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka reference objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you care only about the attributes and logic of an element of the model, classify it as a value object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it express the meaning of the attributes it conveys and give it related functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat the value object as immutable. Make all operations side-effect-free functions that don’t depend on any mutable state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t give a value object any identity and avoid the design complexities necessary to main entities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;model information about activity in the domain as a series of discrete events. Represent each event as a domain event object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are distinct from system events that reflect activity within the software itself. However, a system event is often associated with a domain event, either as part of a response to the domain event or to carry information about the domain event into the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore irrelevant domain activity while making explicit the events that the domain experts want to track or be notified of or associated with state change in the other model objects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a significant transformation process in the domain is not a natural responsibility of an entity or value object, add an operation to the model as a standalone interface declared as a service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a service contract, a set of assertions about interactions with the service. State these assertions in the ubiquitous language of a specific bounded context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the service a name, which also becomes a ubiquitous language.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concepts should be divided into modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose modules that tell the story of the system and contain a cohesive set of ideas. Give the modules the names that become part of the ubiquitous language. Modules are part of the model, and their names should reflect insight into the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek low coupling in the sense of concepts that can be understood and reasoned about independently. Then, refine the model until it partitions according to high-level domain concepts and decouples the corresponding code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it challenging to guarantee the consistency of changes to objects in a model with complex associations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster the entities and value objects into aggregates and define boundaries around each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose one entity to be the root of each sum, and allow external objects to hold references to the source only (regarding internal members passed out for use within a single operation only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define properties and invariants for the aggregate as a whole and give enforcement responsibility to the root or some designated framework mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the exact aggregate boundaries to govern transactions and distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;within an aggregate edge, apply consistency rules synchronously. Across borders, handle updates asynchronously

&lt;li&gt;query access to sums expressed in the ubiquitous language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each type of aggregate that needs global access, create a service that can provide the illusion of an in-memory collection of all objects of that aggregate’s root type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up access through a well-known global interface.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide methods to add and remove objects, encapsulating the actual insertion or removal of data in the data store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide methods that select objects based on criteria meaningful to domain experts. For example, return fully instantiated objects or collections of objects whose attribute values meet the requirements, thereby encapsulating the actual storage and query technology, or return proxies that give the illusion of fully instantiated aggregates lazily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide repositories only for aggregate roots that actually need direct access. Keep application logic focused on the model, delegating all object storage and access to the repositories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shift the responsibility for creating instances of complex objects and aggregates to a separate object, which may itself have no responsibility in the domain model but is still part of the domain design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an interface that encapsulates all complex assemblies and does not require the client to reference the concrete classes of the instantiated objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an entire aggregate as a piece, enforcing its invariants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create complex value objects like a piece, possibly after assembling the elements with a builder.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supple design complements the deep modelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client developer, who weaves the domain objects into the application code or other domain layer code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The client developer can flexibly use a minimal set of loosely coupled concepts to express a range of scenarios in the domain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effects of its code must be transparently obvious, so the consequences of a change will be easy to anticipate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making behaviour obvious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reduces the cost of change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;name classes and operations to describe their effect and purpose, without reference to how they do what they promise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This relieves the client developer of the need to understand the internals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These names should conform to the ubiquitous language so that team members can quickly infer their meaning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;decompose design elements (operations, interfaces, classes, and aggregates) into cohesive units, considering your intuition of the essential divisions in the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe the axes of change and stability through successive refactorings, and look for underlying conceptual contours that explain these shearing patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Align the model with the consistent aspects of the domain that make it a viable area of knowledge in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to plot strategy, we need a realistic, large-scale view of model development extending across our project and others we integrate with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify each model in play on the project and define its bounded context. This includes the implicit models of non-object-oriented subsystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name each bounded context, and make the names part of the ubiquitous language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe the point of contact between the models, outlining explicit translation for any communication. Highlighting any sharing, isolation mechanism, and levels of influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map the existing terrain. Take up the transformations later.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when teams in two contexts succeed or fail together, a cooperative relationship often emerges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where development failure in either of two contexts would result in delivery failure for both, forging a partnership between the teams in charge of the two contexts. Institute a process for coordinated planning of development and joint management of integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The teams must cooperate on the evolution of their interface to accommodate the developments needs of both systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interdependent features should be scheduled to complete for the same release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharing a part of the model and associated code is a very intimate interdependency, which can leverage design work or undermine it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design with an explicit boundary some subset of the domain model that the teams agree to share. Keep this kernel small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within this boundary, include this subset of the model, the subset of code or the database design associated with that part of the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This explicitly shared stuff has a special status and shouldn’t be changed without consultation with the other team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When functional integration is limited, the overhead of continuous integration of a significant context may be deemed too high. This may especially be true when the team does not have the skill or the political organization to maintain continuous integration or when a single team is simply too big and unwieldy.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when 2 teams are in an upstream-downstream relationship, where the upstream team may succeed independently of the fate of the downstream team, the needs of the downstream come to be addressed in a variety of ways with a wide range of consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a clear customer/supplier relationship between the two teams, meaning downstream priorities factor into upstream planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiate and budget tasks for downstream requirements so that everyone understands the commitment and schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jointly developed automated acceptance tests and validate the expected interface from the upstream. Adding these tests to the upstream team’s test suite, to be run as part of its continuous integration, will free the upstream team to make changes without fear of downstream side effects.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;similar to customer/supplier, but the upstream has no motivation to provide for the downstream team’s need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to eliminate the complexity of translation between bounded contexts by slavishly adhering to the model of the upstream team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubiquitous language with your upstream team will be shared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altruism may be sufficient to get them to share information with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translation becomes more complex when control or communication is insufficient to pull off a shared kernel, partner, or customer/supplier relationship. As a result, the translation takes on a more defensive tone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a downstream client, create an isolating layer to provide your system with the functionality of the upstream system in terms of your own domain model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This layer talks to the other system through its existing interface, requiring little or no modification to the other system. Internally, the layer translates in one or both directions as necessary between the two models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where integration is one-off, this approach of inserting a translation layer for each external system avoids corruption of the models with a minimum cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a protocol that gives access to your subsystem as a set of services. Then, open the protocol so that all who need to integrate with you can use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance and expand the protocol to handle new integration requirements, except when a single team has idiosyncratic needs. Then, use a one-off translator to augment the protocol for that particular case so what the shared protocol can stay coherent and straightforward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a subsystem has to be integrated with many others, customizing a translator for each can bog down the team. There is more and more to maintain and more and more to worry about when changes are made.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The translation between the models of two bounded contexts requires a common language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a well-documented shared language to express the necessary domain information as a common communication medium, translating as essential into and out of that language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published language is often combined with open-host service.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;well-defined context boundaries only emerge from intellectual choices and social forces (even though the people creating the systems may not always have been consciously aware of these causes at the time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw a boundary around the entire mess and designate it as a big ball of mud. Do not try to apply sophisticated modelling within this context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be alert to the tendency for such systems to sprawl into other contexts.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you focus on your central problem and keep from drowning in a sea of side issues?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distillation is the process of separating the components of a mixture to extract the essence in a form that makes it more valuable and useful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A model is a distillation of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to make a domain model an asset, the critical core of that model has to be sleek and fully leveraged to create application functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boil the model down. Define a core domain and provide a means of easily distinguishing it from the mass of supporting model and code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring the most valuable and specialized concepts into sharp relief. Make the core small.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply top talent to the core domain, and recruit accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend the effort in the core to find a deep model and develop a supple design - sufficient to fulfill the system’s vision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some parts of the model add complexity without capturing or communicating specialized knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify cohesive subdomains that are not the motivation for your project, factor out generic models of these subdomains and place them in separate modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave no trace of your specialties in them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once they have been separated, give their continuing development lower priority than the core domain, and avoid assigning your core developers to the tasks (because they will gain little domain knowledge from them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also, consider off-the-shelf solutions or published models for these generic subdomains.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the critical aspects of the domain model may span multiple bounded contexts, but by definition, these distinct models can’t be structured to show their common focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a short description (about one page) of the core domain and the value it will bring, the “value proposition.” ignore those aspects that do not distinguish this domain model from others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write this statement early and revise it as you gain new insight.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a domain vision statement identifies the core domain in broad terms, but it leaves the identification of the specific core model elements up to the vagaries of individual interpretation. Unless there is an exceptionally high level of communication on the team, the vision statement alone will have little impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mental labour of constantly filtering the model to identify the essential parts absorbs concentration better spent on design thinking, and it requires comprehensive knowledge of the model. Therefore, the core domain must be made easier to see.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write a brief document (3-7 sparse pages) describing the core domain and the primary interactions among core elements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flag the elements of the core domain within the primary repository of the model without particularly trying to elucidate its role. Make it effortless for a developer to know what is in or out of the core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the vision statement and highlighted core inform and guide, they do not modify the model or the code itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partitioning generic subdomains physically removes some distracting elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;structurally change the model and the design to make the core domain more visible and manageable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conceptual “what” is swamped by the mechanistic “how.” Many methods that provide algorithms for resolving the problem obscure the methods that express the problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partition a conceptually cohesive mechanism into a separate lightweight framework. Particularly watch for formalisms or well-documented categories of algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expose the capabilities of the framework with an intention-revealing interface.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other elements of the domain can focus on expressing the problem (“what”), delegating the intricacies of the solution (“how”) to the framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factoring out generic subdomains reduces clutter, and cohesive mechanisms serve to encapsulate complex operations. This leaves behind a more focused model, with fewer distractions that add no particular value to how users conduct their activities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are unlikely to find good homes for everything in the domain model that is not core.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;approach to structurally marking off the core domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor the model to separate the core concepts from supporting players (including ill-defined ones) and strengthen the cohesion of the core while reducing its coupling to other code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factor all generic or supporting elements into other objects and place them into different packages.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core domain model usually has so much detail that communicates the big picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the most fundamental differentiating concepts in the model and factor them into distinct classes, abstract classes, or interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design this abstract model to express most of the interaction between significant components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place this abstract model in its own module, while the specialized, detailed implementation classes are left in their own modules defined by the subdomain.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “large-scale structure” is a language that lets you discuss and understand the system in broad strokes. A set of high-level concepts or rules, or both, establishes a pattern of design for an entire system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devise a pattern of rules or roles and relationships that will span the entire system and allow some understanding of each part’s place in the whole-even without detailed knowledge of the part’s responsibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architectures can straitjacket a project with up-front design assumptions and take too much power away from the developers/designers of particular application parts. Soon, developers/designers of specific details of the applications will dumb down the application to fit the structure, or they will subvert it and have no structure, bringing back the problems of uncoordinated development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let this large-scale conceptual structure evolve with the application, possibly changing to a completely different type of structure along the way. Don’t constraint the detailed design and model decisions that must be made with thorough knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The large-scale structure should be applied when a structure can be found that dramatically clarifies the system without forcing unnatural constraints on model development. Because an ill-fitting structure is worse than none, it is best not to shoot for comprehensiveness but rather to find a minimal set that solves the emerging problem. Less is more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;software designs tend to be abstract and hard to grasp. Developers and users alike need tangible ways to understand the system and share a view of the system as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a concrete analogy to the system emerges that captures the imagination of team members and seems to lead thinking in a helpful direction, adopt it as a large-scale structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize the design around this metaphor and absorb it into the ubiquitous language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The system metaphor should facilitate communication about the system and guide the development. This increases consistency in different system parts, potentially even across different bounded contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because all metaphors are inexact, continually reexamine the metaphor for overextension or inaptness, and be ready to drop it if it gets in the way.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at the conceptual dependencies in your model and the varying rates and sources of change of different parts of your domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you identify natural strata in the domain, cast them as broad abstract responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These responsibilities should tell a story of your system’s high-level purpose and design.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactor the model so that the responsibilities of each domain object, aggregate, and module fit neatly within the responsibility of one layer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a group of objects that describe how another group of objects should behave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a distinct set of objects that can define and constrain the structure and behaviour of the basic model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep these concerns separate as 2 “levels,” one very concrete, the other reflecting rules and knowledge that a user or super-user can customize.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a pluggable component framework usually only comes into play after a few applications have already been implemented in the same domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distill an abstract core of interfaces and interactions and create a framework that allows diverse implementations of those interfaces to be freely substituted. Likewise, it will enable any application to use those components, so long as it operates strictly through the interfaces of the abstract core.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sub-domain is a problem space concept, Bounded context is a solution space concept.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As software developers, we fail in two ways: We build the thing wrong, or we build the wrong thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A project faces serious problems when its language is fractured.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Integration is always expensive, and sometimes the benefit is small.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Architectures can straitjacket a project with up-front design assumptions and take too much power away from the developers/designers of particular parts of the application. Soon, developers/designers of particular parts of the applications will dumb down the application to fit the structure, or they will subvert it and have no structure at all, bringing back the problems of uncoordinated development..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each time we decide to call upon such a capability for some new purpose, someone has to meticulously sift through it all, finding an odd combination of inputs that will evoke the behaviour or return the information we want without messing anything else up, it takes trial and error and extensive testing, and the result is typically brittle. The developer who made it work walks away exhausted, successful on his terms, leaving the system even more complex than before. Then, the next time a closely related yet not identical need comes along, it starts all over..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Common context, the tragedy of commons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“adding data is a way of referring to a core aspect of some business situation, and enriching ubiquitous language to be able to express these concerns. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design is intelligence made visible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People think that design is styling. Design is not style. It’s not about giving shape to the shell and not giving a damn about the guts. Good design is a renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need, and beauty to produce something that the world didn’t know it was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is intelligence made visible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Design is] a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is design? it’s where you stand with a foot in 2 worlds - the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes - and you try to bring the 2 together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design isn’t just to satisfy requirements, but also to uncover requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perfection is not reached when there is nothing to be added anymore, but when there is nothing to be left out anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the design process, at its best, integrates the aspirations of art, science, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to say that something is designed means it has intentions that go beyond its function. Otherwise, it’s just planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good design defuses the tension between functional and aesthetic goals precisely because it works within the boundaries defined by the functional requirements of communication problem. Unlike the fine arts, which exists for their own sake, design must always solve a particular real-world problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in practice, designing seems to proceed by oscillating between sub-solution and sub-problem areas, as well as decomposing the problem and combining sub-solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you specify something to be designed, tell what properties you need, not how they are to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the trick is to hold “process” off long enough to permit great design to occur, so that the lesser issues can be debated once the great design is on the table - rather than smothering it in the cradle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good design is good business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you think it’s expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all… good design must primarily serve people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point: design is inevitable. The alternative to good design is bad design, not no design at all. Everyone makes design decisions all the time without realizing it - like Moliere’s M. Jourdain who discovered he had been speaking prose all his life, and good design is simply the result of making these decisions consciously, at the right stage, and in consultation with others as the need arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a good design is not the one that correctly predicts the future, it’s one that makes adapting to the future affordable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we’ve probably designed 4000 products at IDEO over my career, and for every one of them I’d like to send a little note with it that says, “I’m sorry that it’s in this present state. Given what I know now, if I could start over again it would be a lot better”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is easy. All you do is stare at the screen until drops of blood form on your forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ease of use and ease of learning are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;computer design is often bad design done on a computer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our opportunity as designers, is to learn how to handle the complexity, rather than shy away from it, and to realize that the big art of design is to make complicated things simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no, Watson, this was not done by accident, but by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is about making things good (and then better) and right (and fantastic) for the people who use and encounter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never design a building before I’ve seen the site and met the people who will be using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the only important thing about design is how it relates to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a design isn’t finished until somebody is using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;still under constructions&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;over past decades, the economy has moved away from brute force labor to analyzing and applying information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ability to do deep work will determine how much you thrive in the information economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn and master new skills
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;technology and best practices become obsolete quickly in the information economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;determine if your goal is attainable and ensure that the skill is relevant to your career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a method that aligns with your learning style and allows you to take on the skill bit by bit, instead of all at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rely on others, find a mentor who can coach you and help you reflect on your progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the skills to increase your output
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high-quality work produced = time spent * intensity of focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what you do with your skill must be useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;efficient, productivity for the sake of increasing output that’s not necessarily useful or high-quality.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in three major ways that modern workplaces derail knowledge workers’ ability to engage in deep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-floor-plans&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#open-floor-plans&quot; aria-label=&quot;open floor plans permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;open floor plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuously distracting environment, where every conversation is heard and one person can disrupt dozens of people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pandemic highlighted the heightened risk of disease transmission in open shared spaces and accelerated their decision to leave the open floor plans behind.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;instant-communication&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#instant-communication&quot; aria-label=&quot;instant communication permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;instant communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with instant messaging tools like Slack and texting, people can interrupt your work on-demand. As a result, we stop being deep thinkers and become human network routers. We could use the platform’s features to notify senders that you won’t be responding immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#social-media&quot; aria-label=&quot;social media permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;social media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the new content you see always seems novel and productive, but it doesn’t move you closer to the major things you really care about. The addictive quality of social media is due to our attraction to variable rewards: rewards that happen at random times, rather than in a predictable pattern. You can’t predict which refresh of your newsfeed will reward you with interesting information or likes, so the action never loses its appeal.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deep work actually moves you meaningfully toward happiness and fulfillment. Deep work is when you’re most capable of tackling your thorniest problems. Because these problems often yield the largest rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when people concentrate on a worthwhile task that pushes them to their cognitive limit, they experience a state of flow or a sense of contentment and purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s more effective to approach deep work with structure, habit, and discipline. In other words, to make deep work a practiced ritual. It becomes a habit, you no longer have to employ your willpower to overcome distractions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove as many shallow work tasks from your life as possible. Spend nearly all your time on deep work. For example, some authors go off the grid and aren’t reachable by email or through social media. All correspondence comes in by postal mail or through their editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid all shallow tasks, you will have to learn the essential skill of delegation. “Who can I delegate my shallow work to?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carve out regular periods each week, month, or entire parts of the year to focus on deep work. The period should be at least one full day to reach the maximum intensity of deep work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working from home at least one day per week, and planning to do your most mentally demanding tasks in this isolated, focused time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set aside a regular block of time each day to focus on deep work. For example, set aside the morning (such as 8-11 a.m.) for deep work, before jumping into shallow work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the most productive part of your day is the hour right after you wake up because you’re re-charged and the world is relatively quiet and distraction-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;schedule-type-4-ad-hoc&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#schedule-type-4-ad-hoc&quot; aria-label=&quot;schedule type 4 ad hoc permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Schedule Type 4: Ad hoc&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find some time to do deep work whenever you can get it. For example, when on a trip with your family, carve out a few hours to do work before joining them for activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it requires the ability to switch on deep work instantaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much deep work should you try to fit into your day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is a limit to how much deep work you’ll be able to accomplish per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experts who have extensive practice can expand to up to four hours, but rarely are able to exceed this.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schedule in advance when you’ll use the internet. avoid it completely outside these times.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep a note bad nearby where you record the next time you’re scheduled to use the internet, and any ideas you need to revisit once you’re online again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan your work so you don’t need the internet to make progress. If you get stuck by not being able to access the internet, then move on to another task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you must use the internet all day, try using website blocking apps like forest/self-control to help remove the temptation to switch your attention away from deep work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan your tasks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan out everything that you need to do throughout the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use podomoro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quantify depth
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your day is full of shallow tasks, you should consider replacing those with deeper work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reflect on and tweak your schedule
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the accuracy of your time blocks at the end of each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you may feel discouraged if you aren’t able to follow your schedule or give in to distraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this feeling is indistractable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s essential to think of your schedule as an evolving experiment that you probably won’t get right on the first try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of ways to build a schedule better aligned with your need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give yourself intense deadlines that will force you to concentrate to the limit of your ability. Then cut down the time drastically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deadlines create a moderate amount of emotional arousal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coderetreat is a day dedicated to allowing developers time to practice their craft. The focus is on practicing skills like Test-Driven Development (TDD), refactoring, and incremental design that is proven to make developers move faster with fewer bugs. It is designed to enable participants to focus on their practice, with as few distractions as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day is made up of several short sessions where we either work in pairs or mobs to solve a small coding problem. Each session, we start new with the same problem; this allows us to focus on the new skill we are learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coderetreat is an excellent place to learn what you know and what you don’t know. As in life in general, there are always new people to meet, new things to learn, and new ways of working and playing together, whether it be with code or ideas. They create a space where we can try out things that we have always wanted to try out, but we’ve never had time to try. Coderetreat is about peer learning, it can be hard to step outside of your comfort zone but together with other people, it is easy and even fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to mean to practice. You’ve probably been meaning to practice already. Meeting together gives you a chance to actually do it. When we work in a pair or group, we are able to exchange new approaches and ideas and keep each other honest about actually using best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

(it’s not that I complain about it as a matter of fact I love it every single second and I’m amazed at how much I have learned from the community)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been asking myself, what’s the simpler way for me to learn to refactor and share with others? (why refactor, you may ask? it’s because it’s my favourite topic in the long never-ending list of agile technical practices) and for some reason, I really like to share my boring meme jokes, so I guess why not share a list of animated gifs of refactoring and the motivation of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess since I’m an Asian guy (hopefully some kind of descendants from Bruce Lee) so this saying is pretty cool to me:
&lt;strong&gt;“I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 different kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbrains&quot;&gt;J.B Rainsberger&lt;/a&gt;, “I can see one large issue: programmers do not allow the various refactoring patterns to become so easy/comfortable that their fingers can &lt;strong&gt;execute them without conscious thought. This interferes with their progress because they have to switch more often among the questions “which refactorings will improve this design?” and “how do I perform this micro-step?”&lt;/strong&gt; if they don’t become able to perform the micro-steps (a sequence of 3-7 nano steps) easily, they might not breakthrough from “I know how to safely lead the design where I want it to go” to the more powerful &lt;strong&gt;“I can just start removing duplication and improving names and a good design will emerge”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong: the first of these 2 outcomes are good, but the second of these two outcomes is much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the consequences, of never breaking through is that the programmer &lt;strong&gt;will miss out on finding helpful designs that are simpler than the ones that their intuition can see.”&lt;/strong&gt; Damn, I can smell/see big FOMO emotions running through me now!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and as a matter of fact, there are so many moves in refactoring, so I’m curious if I could just distill most of the refactoring moves in under 10 moves (like there’s are 10 basic numbers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so the game plan for this article is to post as many refactoring moves/snippets as possible but then distill them and reduce them to under &lt;strong&gt;10 refactoring snippets&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to copy this and make your own top 10 moves, I would be definitely interested in seeing a different list of top 10 refactoring moves so I can improve my list better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here goes the list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If we can give it a name, we can control it”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to keep class and method names to 1-2 words, and avoid names that duplicate the context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Naming as a process” provides a good heuristic for naming but it’s too freaking long.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Provide safety nets for doing refactoring by leveraging Standard IO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a quick way to provide test coverage without knowing much about the underlying code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would probably be more tedious to mock out external/IO/Database call in the code.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to avoid breaking all existing clients when introducing new fields, new classes, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-approach&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#common-approach&quot; aria-label=&quot;common approach permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Common Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a warm, dry place where the code can be changed and disrupt client less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus on changes inside the warm, dry place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish the changes when they’re ready, which often means inlining the warm, dry place (put it back where it was) or inlining the clients of the warm, dry place (the new code replaces some older code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I asked myself the question: “How come it’s not easy to adapt TDD, automated testing which should be the core value of any efficient team?” I don’t think that people is lazy or people is resistant, I think as the industry, there’s lots of ambiguity in how people should approach TDD (SOLID principles, 4 simple rules of design, etc … are too generic) and agile practices (agile manifesto, etc…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, How can I apply SOLID, 4 simple rules of design into my day to day jobs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the most important reasons for developers to write automated tests? is it testability design, is it executable documentations?….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what’s the different between integration/component/API tests? should we care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when I discuss unit tests with QA, typical answers I get is that it’s programmer tests? IT’S SO NOT TRUE? It does contain many behaviors of the systems, some behaviors are at very low level and business people shouldn’t care about, but I believe &lt;strong&gt;MOST OF THE BEHAVIORS&lt;/strong&gt; could and should be expressed at &lt;strong&gt;high level domain language&lt;/strong&gt; and can be used as &lt;strong&gt;executable documentation&lt;/strong&gt; for different stakeholders such as QA/Non technical people. Should we call those tests as behavior unit tests instead of unit tests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we make the TDD/Refactor/agile practices easier for people to adapt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe, &lt;strong&gt;shrink the change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe, there’s lots of things can go wrong but there’s few things that you got to get it right, so &lt;strong&gt;script critical moves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe, Looking for bright spot (examples) so people can see the benefits and &lt;strong&gt;start small?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe, &lt;strong&gt;tweak the environments&lt;/strong&gt; to encourage the right behavior and discourage the wrong behavior?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think code retreat is one of the good place for me to find the answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yet another interpretation of pyramid tests]]></title><description><![CDATA[In recent conversations regarding automating tests, It seems to me that the common understanding of the team is that the only acceptable…]]></description><link>https://tonytvo.github.io/yet-another-interpretation-pyramid-tests/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tonytvo.github.io/yet-another-interpretation-pyramid-tests/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent conversations regarding automating tests, It seems to me that the common understanding of the team is that the only acceptable automated test case is through the workflow tests through the UI. As far as I know, that’s not entirely correct and per “Pyramids of Automation” chapter 15 in More Agile Testing, I think there are lots of different ways we can automate test cases. I would like to take the opportunity to describe the pyramids of automation again with some thoughts/questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me try to describe the original pyramid again, and here’s the picture that is worth thousands of words&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per the above pyramid from Mike Cohn with some modification in “More Agile Testing”, the lowest level, the unit tests, gets the fastest feedback on every commit which would provide the most benefits. &lt;strong&gt;The higher the tests located in the pyramid texts, the slower the feedback and lower profit we would get from the automated tests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The test automation pyramid is a model intended to guide teams in getting the most value from their test automation for the minimum investment and with the least overlap/duplication between each pyramid level.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s expand the above pyramid with some specific tools/context for our team&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the expanded pyramid tests, we can see that we need to leverage different tools and techniques to do different automated testings at different levels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the above pyramids tests, I think there’s still 1 missing piece in the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to How to implement UI Testing without shooting yourselves in the foot, in order to avoid maintenance costs of UI tests, a very good idea when designing UI level functional tests is to think about describing the UI test and the automation at these 3 different levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The stability in acceptance tests comes from the fact that business rules don’t change as much as technical implementations”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology moves much faster than business. &lt;strong&gt;The closer your acceptance tests are to the business rules, the more stable they are and the more clearer it is to the entire team (QA, Dev, PdM, etc…) on what the systems, products suppose to behave&lt;/strong&gt;. The acceptance tests could be written in the form of unit tests, integration tests, UI tests, etc… The team usually would decide if they could automate the acceptance criteria and at what test level they want to automate the acceptance criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the problems we often encountered with integration, UI tests are slowness in getting the feedback, hard to diagnose the problems when the tests fail (especially performance tests), flaky tests, etc… As a result, I feel that &lt;strong&gt;the more acceptance tests could be written in the form of unit behavior tests, the better alignment between the code and the business domain/behavior. This could lead to other benefits such as ubiquitous language for the entire team and design test-ability for the system/product and the better design skills of the team working in the system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on all of the above information, I ask myself, “should we call unit tests as behavior unit tests instead of units tests?”. Yes there is some behavior that is at such a low level that people don’t care about, but there are LOTS of behavior unit tests that in HIGH LEVEL that different stakeholders SHOULD know about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague (David) summarizes this article in the following key points and I couldn’t find a better way to put it together and here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we move our conversation around test to business rules we will all have more clarity and will decouple our conversations from the details. We will gain stability (because our terms don’t - change with the technical details) and clarity because we focus on the actual goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking at the business rule level allows us to determine if that business rule can be tested at a level lower than the UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some business rules can be tested at the unit test level, in which case we should adopt the term behavioral unit test to help people comprehend that those tests are actually testing business rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

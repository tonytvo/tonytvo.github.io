&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The search for undervalued stocks should start with companies that are undesirable, such as those in bankruptcy or suffering from financial distress”. Another way to think about is to focus on great company at fair price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the problem with the present value method is that it is a terminal value calculation as of today, and it does not avoid the problems with terminal calculation (terminal value is the value of a company’s cash flows projected beyond the end of year 10, when the cash flow grows perpetually at a constant proportional rate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discounted cash flows models problems
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies grow at vastly different levels and rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it is a rule for translating between the assumptions that you can make reliably about the future and the present day value of the security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;combining bad information with good information and you are not using assumptions you can make but you are also throwing away information that is on the balance sheet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings power value technique
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the value of assets a competitor will be required to have in order to achieve the same market value of incumbent company in the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings power value calculated based on current financial status where the resulting intrinsic value ignores business cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;growth is usually ignored in this valuation technique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-analysis/earnings-power-value-epv/&quot;&gt;Earnings Power value (EPV) Stock valuation How-to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a note, Enron had great earnings all the way up to its collapse but FCF foretold the troubles long before the scandal surfaced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value investors consider the three sources of intrinsic value to be the reproduction cost of the company’s assets, the current earnings power of any franchise, and the value of its earnings growth within that franchise. The most difficult aspect to value is the worth of future earnings growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In its simples terms, value investing is the process of calculating the fundamental value of a security, comparing this value to the market price and buying if the value is sufficiently higher than the price to provide a cushion against risk. Value investors are not, repeat not:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technicians, who look only at price movement patterns, ignoring fundamental value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macro-fundamental, or top-down investors, who try to read and predict the market’s response to broad economic events but do not usually scrutinize individual stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price and earnings forecasters, who estimate future earnings based on various factors and buy when their estimate beats the market’s estimate, implied in the market price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value investing demands two virtues: humility and patience. Value investors have to know what they know and know what they don’t know. The best tend to specialize in one area and develop a real understanding of its economics, since a big, meaningful gap exists between “undervalued” and “cheap.” Value investors have to wait until a real bargain comes along. When they find and buy it, they have to wait until the market recognizes the fundamental value and the market price adjusts. Both waits may be long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value investing rests on 3 key characteristics of financial markets
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotionalism and short-term thinking rule market prices in the short-run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;financial assets do have underlying or fundamental economic values that are relatively stable and can be measured by diligent and disciplined investor. Price and value often diverge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a strategy of buying when prices are 33% to 50% below the calculated intrinsic value will produce superior returns in the long-run. The size of the gap between price and value is the “margin of safety”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you identify a statistical irregularity, you want to be able to explain it with an enduring rational to individual and institutional behavior.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutional bias
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;herding: money managers do not want to stray too far from the performance of indexes or “me-too” manager will jump on bandwagon as other people buy and drive stocks up to high P/Es&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;window-dressing: buy the best acting stocks near or before the end of quarter so you have more positive stocks to show investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;block-busters: people will be overly focused on looking for next blockbuster stock like microsoft. You want to be on the other side of their trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;individual bias
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loss aversion: People will gamble to avoid a sure loss. People will take on more loss to avoid sure loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lotteries: people like to buy lottery tickets and get rich quick, that is why people love buying glamour stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hindsight bias: people think they know what is going on. They don’t remember what they really did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set up a data collection and search strategy to find disappointing cheap stocks or where there is a temporary supply/demand imbalance. You want a less well informed, less rational person than you on the other side of the trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at insiders
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who is buying and selling the stock, insiders, management, and investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;search criteria: where are the unreflective sellers&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obscure: small caps, spin-offs, post bankruptcy, boring with low analyst coverage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since funds can’t own small stocks, analysts don’t cover them and the stocks stay obscure. Spin-offs may be small, unheralded and dumped, despite their merits. And, the market tends to ignore boring firms that chug along in monotonous mediocrity. When they do something new, no one may be looking (except the astute value investor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industry problems are your friend as long as you know the industry is viable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;undesirable:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;financial distress, bankruptcy, low growth, low P/E, low M/B,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boring is your friend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industry problems (bad loans, regulatory threat, overcapacity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company problem (lawsuit, poor subsidiary performance, poor year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disappointing (long-term underperformance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other supply, demand imbalance - RTC dumping indiscriminately, eastern europe dumping privatization, index deletions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for large cap global stocks, you are in tough competition.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you would like to be the only one seriously studying a particular security or one of a few people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if you do nothing, but eliminate the high glamour growth stocks you get another one or two percent&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inherent institutional and individual biases create ongoing opportunities and glamour stocks (high growth high P/E)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for companies with sustainable competitive advantages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you want a management that understands the source of of the company’s competitive advantage and will protect it and not tie it to competitive disadvantages or negative synergies in other segment the way Apple did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;valuation-strategy&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#valuation-strategy&quot; aria-label=&quot;valuation strategy permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;valuation strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is this industry viable or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;view &lt;strong&gt;tangible assets at liquidation costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s the most reliable information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the industry is not viable and the company going to get liquidated, you would want to see the valuation in liquidation and that is closely tied to assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assets - Look at the balance sheet. Work from the top down. Some values have to be adjusted because accounting numbers are more accurate for some assets and liabilities than for others. What matters is the assets’ value if they were sold today. If an industry is on the path to extinction, its equipment and inventory may not have more than scrap value. If the industry will continue to exist, the proper value is the “reproduction value,” the cost of replacing the asset. In general, items at the top of the balance sheet - cash, receivables, inventory - have values close to the book value. The book value is more questionable farther down the balance sheet. Usually it’s possible to come up with an estimate more reliable than an estimate of future earnings. The assets and liabilities are real, exist now and do have some value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reproduction cost of an asset is the most appropriate measure of its worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the industry to viable, then sooner or later the assets are going to be replaced, so you have to look at the costs of reproducing those assets as efficient as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/how-to-asset-reproduction-value-analysis/&quot;&gt;asset reproduction value analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the second most reliable measure of a firm’s intrinsic value is the value of its current earnings, properly adjusted. This value can be estimated with more certainty than future earnings or cash flows, and it is more relevant to today’s values than are earnings in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings, if they are sustainable, are supported by assets or barriers to entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash flow - Benjamin Graham and David Dodd used the Earnings Power Value (EPV) formula to calculate the level of distributable cash flow that a company could reasonably sustain. The formula is: “EPV = Adjusted Earnings x 1/R, where R is the current cost of capital.” Because companies often artificially inflate earnings by booking some costs as allegedly non-recurring, the savvy value investor researches the history, calculates the usual ratio of such charges to reported earnings and reduces current reported earnings appropriately. The investor may need to make a similar adjustment for depreciation and amortization, which can also misrepresent the real need to reinvest. Finally, the investor considers the business cycle, adjusting earnings based on whether the company is at its top or bottom. The EPV must be sustainable. For assurance that it is, look for sustaining strategic advantages like franchise value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless there is something to interfere with this process of entry, sooner or later the market value of the company will be driven down to the reproduction value of the assets. &lt;em&gt;Reversion to the Mean or the Uniformity of One Price&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have EPV in excess of reproduction value (AV) of the assets, there had better be something to interfere with the process of entry such as competitive advantage such as barriers of entry, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;then and only then you should worry about growth&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the only case where growth has value is where the growth occurs behind the protection of an identifiable competitive advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;growth only has value if it is a strong franchise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to adjust for any accounting shenanigans that are going on, you have to adjust for the cyclical situation, for the tax situation that may be short-lived, for excess depreciation over the cost of maintenance capital expense (MCX). And really for anything else that is going on that is causing current earnings to deviate from long run sustainable earnings. So &lt;strong&gt;valuation is calculated by a company’s long-run sustainable earnings multiplied by 1/cost of capital&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;entry barriers: A franchise only has value when competitors can’t easily enter the market and take chunks of it away. Only a few things create real barriers to entry:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government - Licenses and other legally protected privileges, e.g. cable franchises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs
- Expense creates a barrier if the incumbent has cost advantages no one can duplicate, especially patents or proprietary knowledge a competitor can’t match or buy. Economies of scale matter; if unit costs fall as more units are produced, a new entrant can’t match a high-volume leader (absent new technology or processes).
- Revenues - In rare cases, customers are so attached to a particular brand (think Coca-Cola) that it is very difficult for a new entrant to seduce them. Also, costly switching virtually traps customers, i.e., buyers of corporate software suites must also train staff and debug. Here, the cost of switching helps protect Microsoft’s franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AV &gt; EPV
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the EPV as a guide to intrinsic value. Either management is doing a bad job (and could only be dislodged in a takeover) or the industry suffers from overcapacity (so increased value requires reduced capacity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AV approximately equal to EPV
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It tells a story of an industry that is in balance. It is exactly what you would expect to see if there were no barriers-to- entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management is probably mediocre and the firm lacks a competitive edge. To check, examine management’s returns and judge whether they are about average. Is the industry stable, or do competitors come and go? This kind of firm may be a good value investment if market price falls far enough below fundamental value for a margin of safety, but growth estimates are worthless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accounts receivable can be valued at book value, although in liquidation, you will recover 90% to 95% of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good management always adds value to the assets not already embedded in the earnings. Bad management subtracts value from the assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;growth is valued separately since growth is where all the uncertainty resides and you want to segregate that uncertainty from what you know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth is relatively rarely valuable in the long run. &lt;strong&gt;Growth at a competitive disadvantage has negative value&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only case where growth has value is where the growth occurs behind the protection of an identifiable competitive advantage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is usually &lt;strong&gt;stable market share&lt;/strong&gt; which is symptomatic of that last situation that means in the long run,the company will grow at the industry rate. And in the long run, almost all industries grow at the rate of global GDP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value of growth
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;verify the existence of a franchise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify the cash distributions in terms of dividends and buybacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t overestimate growth once the company is out of its rapid growth phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;competitive analysis&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Porter’s 5 forces that effect the operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dominant force determining whether this is good business or not: entrants and expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the companies who have sustainable competitive advantages are the ones like MSFT and INTI, WMT, CISCO who focus on narrow segments on geographical space or product space and dominate those particular segments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower cost structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customer captivity due to habits, search costs or switching costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;globalization and large, fast growth is the enemy of competitive advantage and profitability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your local infrastructure in relation to the size of the market will determine your regional economies of scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value investors control risk by specializing in situations that don’t correlate with the market, such as take-overs, spin-offs, arbitrage, bankruptcy and workouts. They double-check their conclusions by watching insiders or knowledgeable investors and by closely scrutinizing their calculations for errors. They use position limits to restrict how much they invest in any one stock or security. Or, like Warren Buffett, they buy whole companies.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vigilant leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term prospects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stock stability&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, management focus more on optimizing their own pay rather than optimizing returns to the shareholders. In other cases, management may have the intention of maximizing the returns to the shareholders, but are taking high risks in doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many managers simply want to grow their “empire” with the shareholders’ retained earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio = liabilities/equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company’s goal should be the flexibility to enter good projects at all times and withstand any challenges in the market. This is generally achieved when the company sustains a low debt-to-equity ratio of below 0.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some industries are characterized by low debt-to-equity ratios; while banks, with a core product of debt, typically have higher ratios. You should therefore also consider industry standard for normal levels of debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-2-high-current-ratio&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#rule-2-high-current-ratio&quot; aria-label=&quot;rule 2 high current ratio permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;rule 2: high current ratio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current ratio = current assets/current liabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a company always receives more cash than it pays out, the company can meet its short-term debt obligations at any time (typically current ratio between 1.5 and 2.5)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a low current ratio may mean that the company has problems meeting their short-term obligations, while higher current ratio may indicate bad money management due to an inability to collect payment from vendors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return on equity = net income / shareholders’ equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in general, you should look for companies that have had a consistent ROE of above 8% over the last 10 years. It tells you that the company is consistently making a decent profit with the earnings that management retains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for a ROE that has been steady or even increasing over the last eight to ten years. This means that the company generally keep all or some of the capital for future investment and increases the equity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check the industry trend for comparison&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never be attracted to a high return while compromising security. In other words, manage risk first (i.e., D/E), then consider the remaining choices based on yield (i.e, ROE).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By choosing a company with historical D/E of below 0.5, you will most likely end up with companies with lower ROE, but they will likely be more sustainable in the future.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compensation packages based on stock price performance gives management wrong incentives to act truthfully to protect the shareholders’ interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trustworthy companies and management teams disclose the structure of the compensation plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managers should only be rewarded based on performance and long-term goals. You should look for long-term roadmaps with a variety of objectives to be obtained.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find business that has sustainable competitive advantage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher profitability, higher return on capital, and large market share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sustainable competitive advantage cannot be duplicated by competitors; hence the business will keep pouring money into the owners’ pockets.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, Coca-Cola has a great moat due to its enormous brand value, share of mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wal-Mart has a wide moat due to its cost structure where it can buy products with large volume from its suppliers at a cheaper price than its competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple has networks effect: the more people join apple community the more profit it made
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company enjoys a network effect advantage when the values of it’s product or service increases with the number of users. Network effect companies are often digital. Facebook, Google, eBay and Western Union are prime examples of such companies. Take Facebook as an example. The more users it has, the greater the reach it has with its ads, the more companies are willing to pay for its reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geico has low cost when price significant to customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample moats from different industries. High cost of switching to Samsung even iphone is more expensive
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intangible assets such as brands and patents
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples of intangible asset advantages include: patents, brand reputation and government licences such as Disney. Tiffany &amp;#x26; Co. is a prime example of a company with an excellent brand reputation. The company’s established brand name provides it with significant pricing power: a necklace from Tiffany &amp;#x26; Co. could easily costs several thousand more than a necklace from a less well-known brand. Vanguard’s patented technique that avoids taxes on mutual funds has enabled it to charge significantly less management fees for its financial products while preventing incumbents from imitating it. Bond rating agencies are great examples of companies that have a significant regulatory advantage. Ratings agencies must be granted a “Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organization” recognition before they can practice in the United States. This stringent regulatory requirement limits the playing field and allows ratings agencies to enjoy absurd profit margins (Moody’s was 50% according to the book).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low cost
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wal-Mart can buy at quantities and prices that competitors can’t match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost advantages can stem from four sources: cheaper processes, better locations, unique assets and greater scale. Process based advantages are often less desirable because other companies might attempt to copy their process. These types of advantages are the most salient in industries where price plays a critical part in the customer’s purchasing decision. According to the author, Southwest Airlines had a process-based cost advantage moat in the airline industry. The company used only one type of jet, minimized ground time and rewarded employee thrift, which allowed them to charge less than their competitors. Southwest was an exception to the generalization that process-based moats are less desirable. Their thrift-centric process was so different from their competitor’s processes that it could not be du&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high switching costs (“stickiness”)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most people will not bother with the hassle of changing operating system such as Microsoft, because they do not want to re-learn the new system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dorsey identifies three main flavours of switching costs — tight integration with a customer’s business, high monetary switching costs and high retraining costs. Oracle and Adobe are two companies in this category of companies. Oracle’s database systems are so heavily ingrained into their client’s businesses that it would be extremely costly for firms to replace them. Furthermore, replacing them could entail unwanted operational risks. Such tight integration with a customer’s business enables high retention rates, steady cash flows from customer annuities and a certain degree of pricing power for Oracle. Most digital designers have spent years mastering Adobe Photoshop. If a design firm were to force its designers to use a different image editing software it would incur a significant financial and timely retraining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;porter 5 forces
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;barriers to entry&lt;/strong&gt;: advantages that existing, established companies have over new entrants. A firm will enter the industry it it forecasts that the potential reward for being in it is greater than the cost of overcoming the barriers and the retaliation that is likely to happen.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supply-side economies of scale: spread the fixed costs over a larger volume of units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demand-side benefits of scale: network effect, people tend to value being in a ‘network’ with a larger number of people who use the same company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customer switching costs: airline frequent flyer programs are an example. Customer doesn’t want to switch to different product to avoid re-learning (such as microsoft operating system, or iphone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capital requirements: websites and apps can be launched cheaply and easily as opposed to the brick and mortar industries of the past. Railroads are almost impossible to enter. It takes a ton of capital and it is an enormous risk to build a second railroad network next to to the existing one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incumbency advantages independent of size (e.g. customer loyalty and brand equity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unequal access to distribution channels: new entrants may struggle to find a retail or wholesale channel to sell through as existing competitors will have a claim on them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;governmental policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;threat of substitutes&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perceived level of product differentiation: lowest price or differentiation. Developing multiple products for niche markets is one way to mitigate this factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number of substitute products available in the market, ease of substitution, availability of close substitutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;substitutes that are becoming cheaper relative to performance and substitutes that earn high returns on capital are likely to have more new entries in the future, which will drive prices down within that industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies within industry of power grids face pretty much no substitute at all. No matter how the electricity is produced, it must be transported somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;newspaper face tough competition from online and social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bargaining power of customers&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ability of customers to put the firm under pressure, which also affects the customer’s sensitivity to price changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RFM (customer value) analysis: how recently did the customer purchase? how often do they purchase, how much do they spend?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bargaining power of suppliers&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;degree of differentiation of inputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impact of inputs on cost and differentiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presence of substitute inputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strength of distribution channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supermarkets are powerful players in distributing products of suppliers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;competitive rivalry&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sustainable competitive advantage through innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;competition between online and offline organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;level of advertising expense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower prices, new products and increased service and common weapons of choice and they l0ead to lower profitability for companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for industry with few companies, high growth and low fixed costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;if a margin of safety is 30% on one stock, it may look tempting, but if you have the option to buy another great business (of equal risk) with a 50% discount, you would go for that one instead.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;P/E = market price for the company/Net Income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E ratio is simply a current snapshot in time. it looks at the company’s present performance in order to determine the value of its future performance. This is often a dangerous path if you fail to consider the other variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conservative investor looks for stocks with a P/E ratio below 15, or, in other words, the return should at the very least be 6.67% (which is 1/15) annually. She does not buy into hopes and dreams and she does not think she can spot the new Microsoft. Instead, she busy into a company that is already making a decent profit compared to the price she pays.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FV = PV * (1 + i)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FV : future value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PV : present value or intrinsic value today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i : discount rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;n : number of years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffet’s opinion is that no investment should yield a lower return than a federally issued bond because the federal reserve can simply print more money in order to fulfill its interest obligations; therefore, if a ten-year bond has a 3% return, the investor should never discount a ten-year investment decision lower than 3% annually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can use a conservative market price to determine the current discount rate or potential rate of return
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i = (FV / PV)&lt;sup&gt;1/n&lt;/sup&gt; - 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffet says, “Intrinsic value can be defined simply: it is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every valuation technique can be boiled down to one thing: “How much money can I expect to get in return for my initial investment”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;n : number of years into the future, or year being discounted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GR : company’s estimated annual growth rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a great starting point for picking a percent would be an assessment of the company’s historical free cash flow growth rate. That can be found during your assessment of the company’s previous cash flow statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DF&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;: the discount factor during year n&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DR: discount rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the discount rate represents the return you would like to receive for owning the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DFCF&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; : discounted free cash flow for year n&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DPCF : discounted perpetuity cash flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LGR : long term growth rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for anyone who thinks they’ll be able to predict a company’s ability to grow their profits, beyond the 10 year mark, best of luck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is this company going to have the capacity to remain relevant beyond 10 years?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if yes, simply using the rate of inflation (2-3%) to protect your estimate from being too optimistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;DCF model allowed you to estimate the company’s value by discounting cash flows into perpetuity. The Buffet instrinsic value provide a finite solution and only summed the cash flows for a 10-year period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DCF model use free cash flow, and Buffetts calculator use dividends plus book value growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the model that provides the most conservative estimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limitations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it only works if a stock fulfills all four of Warren Buffett’s principles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a company lacks certain aspects of the principles discussed, those aspects should be assessed as additional risk to the investor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these qualitative aspects should be accounted for by lowering the book value growth rate, lowering the dividend rate, requiring a higher discount rate, ore not even evaluating the stock all together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high-growth companies
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high growth companies naturally have a better opportunity to grow their book value compared to large, slow-growth companies, even if it’s for a limited period of time. These growth rates will yield very high intrinsic values in the calculator. Avoid using more than 13-15% for book value growth in the calculator, even if the company has shown much higher growth over the past 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high degree of share buy-back
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy-backs distort the book value, which in turn also distorts the intrinsic value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it’s corporate strategy to reduce the number of shares outstanding, you’ll probably want to use the DCF model instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stock splits
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;historical book value growth rate isn’t representative of its actual performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe easier to use the DCF model to avoid the disparity when assessing how much the book value may grow in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buffettsbooks.com/how-to-invest-in-stocks/advanced-course/lesson-28/&quot;&gt;when to sell stocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probably wants to consider the impacts of capital gains and bank fees before you impulsively switch assets. You should revert back to Warren Buffett’s four principles:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is the company still managed by vigilant leaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does the company still have products and services that have long-term prospects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are the company’s earnings and debt management still stable and predictable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;based on the projected cash flows, what kind of return you expect at the current trading price?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe you feel that 20% or 35% of your portfolio in one stock is too risky. Although Buffett likes a focused portfolio, he still keesp more than 10 different picks in his portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to decide if you should keep or sell your current holding (stock A), or invest in another (stock B), follow these 4 easy steps:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calculate the expected annual return for stocks A and B based on the current market prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subtract the cost of capital gains tax from stock A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calculate whether stock A or B yields the highest expected annual return based on a given time frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company has changed for the worse. Perhaps the company’s management has shifted their focus to an area where you believe to drive less growth than you would like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s other investment with better opportunity cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;defensive investor’s portfolio should be well balanced, safe and very easy to manage.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at the portfolio of well established investment funds (consider ray dalio’s all weather portfolio, weird portfolio of deep value stock geek, etc…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;majority of portfolio should include index funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it typically consists of high-grade bonds, inflation protected bonds, large cap index fund, gold/silver index fund and common stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minority of portfolio (less than 10%) could be invested in common stocks (at least 10 different companies in different industries)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to employ the services of an expert (once a year) to guide you to make the best investment decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dollar-cost averaging, whereby you invest in a common stock every month or quarter and always with the same amount of money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;readjust your portfolio’s division of common stocks, bonds, index funds, etc… Ask yourself: are my stocks still profitable? is the ratio about the same as when I had initially invested? has the management done anything that lost my trust?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enterprising investor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start similarly to defensive investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invest more in common stocks, as they are more profitable (yet riskier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enterprising investors should limit these stocks to a maximum of 10 percent of her overall portfolio. It is because Mr Market is too wild for any rational person to predict and placing the limits to protect our money in case of economic downturn or poor investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continual research and monitoring of their portfolios is essential to maintain an incoming profit flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice with virtual account for at least 1 year before trading in real accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy in low markets and sell in high markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s extremely difficult to find a good financial professional who can guarantee you large returns on your money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mutual funds, in which investments from many people are pooled, usually come with a high management fee. After subtracting the fee, you’re often left with below-average returns.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;professional money managers can’t afford to perform lower than average for long periods because they keep need to keep their clients satisfied all the time. It’s difficult to hold onto a strategy which might not work for months or years at a time, no matter how effective the strategy is in the long term. You can, though, All it takes is some patience to stock with it during the good and not-so-good times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;index fund such as Standard &amp;#x26; Poor’s 500 Index is a mutual fund which aims to match the market’s best performing companies, as opposed to trying to beat them. Since index fund fees are lower, and because on average the market performs well, index funds often provide you with very healthy profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the stock market values of most companies swing drastically over short time periods for no rational reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider “earnings yield” and the “return on capital” when putting together your investment portfolio
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combine both earnings yield and ROC into one single measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rank the companies based on Earnings Yield and ROC separately and then combine their scores by adding them the scores (ranks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings yield
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tells you what the business earns in relation to its share price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calculated by finding the ratio of earnings before interests expenses and tax (EBIT), to enterprise value (EV). The EV is the market value plus the net interest-bearing debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return on capital
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calculated by dividing the after-tax profit by the book value of invested capital (total amount of money invested by the company’s shareholders, bondholders, and so on)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveals how effective a company is at transforming investment into profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take the following pre-caution with your strategy:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apply the strategy when choosing stocks of large companies, not small ones. Smaller companies don’t have much to offer in terms of shares, so even a slight increase in demand can force their share price up. You may therefore find it challenging to buy their shares at a reasonable price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the strategies should include owning 20-30 large company stocks (in different industries) at a time. (I prefer to narrow the list less than 10, so I can read more about the companies and have a good reason why I want to buy the companies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use tax laws intelligently to maximize your profit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell stocks which lost value before one-year holding period ends, which would decreases your yearly income and thus the taxes you will need to pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell the stocks which increase value after one-year holding period ends, which would reduce your tax on capital gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy stock only when its price is below its intrinsic value, its value as it relates to a company’s propensity for growth. Furthermore, you believe there is a probable margin between what you pay and what you will earn as the company grows (margin of safety)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;principles
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intelligent investors analyze the long-term development and business principles of the companies in which they’re considering investing before buying any stock.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;examining the company’s financial history, structure, quality of its management and whether it pays steady dividends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t fall into the trap of only looking at short-term earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this would give you a better idea of how well a company performs independent of its value on the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protect against serious losses by diversifying the investments. (portfolio of 10-20 stocks in different industries)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand that you don’t pull in extraordinary profits, but safe and steady revenues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the target for intelligent investor is to meet her personal needs, not to outperform the professional stockbrokers on Wall Street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand the importance of stock-market history
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economic crises, the unpredictability of the market means that investors need to be prepared - financially and psychologically to ensure that you can take a big hit and survive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t sell everything at the first sign of danger. Remember instead that, even after the most devastating crashes, the market will always recover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the history of the market will give you a better idea of its stability. Once you’ve determined that the market is stable, focus on the history of the company in which you’d like to invest.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at the correlation between stock price and the company’s earnings and dividends over the past 10 years. Then consider the inflation rate, in order to see how much you’d really earn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focuses on individual companies, rather than macro-economic factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invests in companies with sustainable competitive advantages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prefers becoming an expert on a few companies over major diversification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bases his investment decisions on the operational performance of the underlying businesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;holds on to stocks for an extremely long period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minimizes risks by requiring a significant margin of safety before investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sticks to the companies within the “circle of competence”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contrarian, always going against the crowd and buying at the point of maximum pessimism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global investment approach: looks for interesting stocks in every country, but preferably countries with limited inflation, high economical growth, and a movement toward liberalization and privatization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prefers a concentrated portfolio with around 10-12 stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be patience and keep an open-mind and a skeptical attitude towards conventional wisdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first step is to look for stocks trading below 2/3rd of net current asset value (NCAV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prefers companies which pay dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings should be growing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;price/earnings ratio should be lower than 15 over the past 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid technical analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasizes the importance of honest, able management, and shareholder friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should not follow the masses, but instead have patience and think for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asking questions to customers, employees, competitors, analysts, suppliers and management to find out more about the competitive position of a company and its management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only sells when a company starts experiencing issues with its business model, competitive positioning, or management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looks for low-risk, high-uncertainty opportunities with a significant upside potential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use value line investment survey to find attractive stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is futile to predict interest rates and where the economy is heading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;formulates exactly why the stock should be bought before actually buying it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use several valuation methods simultaneously, since no method is perfect and it is impossible to precisely calculate the intrinsic value of a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you should find out not only if an asset is undervalued, but also why it is undervalued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when it comes to shrewd trading, a knowledge of history is a fine weapon, so be sure to keep it sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t trust the crowd or the market and follow practical investment based on your unique investment style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow the investor that interests you such as Benjamin Graham, Warrent Buffet, Peter Lynch, John Templeton, etc…
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow the corporate insiders who run the companies (president, chairman, CEO, chief legal counsel, directors, board members who meet regularly with the officers, form 4 on details of the insider trades, etc…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s a good sign when insiders buy their own company shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;criterias for growth/risky stock:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the company is a leader in cutting-edge technology that changes how we live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has breakthrough products used by millions of customers around the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those products are protected by trademarks and patents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars in future safes and profits - not just expected but, ideally, contractually guaranteed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s relatively undiscovered and trading for low price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s a good sign when insiders buy their own company shares
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;top level insider buying , directors, officers, chairmen board, c-level executives… Who are intimated acquainted with company financial health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total buys must exceed 100k and it’s clister from mutiple top level insider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 factors that impact the investment portfolio:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of money you save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the length of time you allow that money to compound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your portfolio’s investment returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of expenses your portfolio absorbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of taxes you pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your asset allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;what is your default strategy when there is nothing to do?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy the market in an index fund vs cash?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what does the absence of opportunity tell you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why are you the only one seeing this opportunity?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People remember the recent past better than the distant past, and they informally generalize from a few cases that are memorable rather than incorporate the full body of data into their analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it tracks value”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best predictor of a mutual fund’s future investment return is not the number of Morningstar stars it receives, but how low its expense ratio is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“price is what you pay, value is what you get”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“financial markets, far from accurately reflecting all the available knowledge, always provide a distorted view of reality. This is the principle of fallibility. The degree of distortion may vary from time to time. Sometimes, it’s quite insignificant, at other times, it is quite pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every bubble has 2 components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. When a positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, a boom-bust process is set in motion. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investing may not be neurosurgery, but it isn’t child’s play either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To recall a piece of wisdom Warren Buffett frequently cites, if you have been in the poker game for thirty minutes and still don’t know who the patsy is, you can be pretty certain the patsy is you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes are based on the Illuminated edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In investing, no rule works all the time. Markets are fluid systems, influenced by many variables, including the players involved in it. Change is constant. Surprises are inevitable. Unexpected things do happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best investment approach should be built on common sense and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Level Thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To earn above-average returns, you not only must think differently and behave differently than everyone else, but you must be right more often than the consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-level thinkers rely on headlines and consensus opinions to make investment decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second-level thinkers weigh the possible outcomes, compare it against the consensus view, understand the consequences of being wrong, and the probability of being right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-level thinking is simplistic and binary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second-level thinking is complex and probabilistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second-level thinkers often ask: “Who doesn’t know that?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Efficiency: markets are quick to incorporate new information into asset prices. However, it does not mean assets are priced accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More “efficient” assets tend to be: widely known, broadly followed, socially acceptable, and the information on it is widely available and comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More “inefficient” assets tend to be: little known or followed, taboo or controversial, and the information on it is limited and/or difficult to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inefficiency is necessary to outperform the market, but won’t guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assets prices are a product of consensus view. A contrarian view, and being right, is needed to recognize mispricing in markets. That, of course, is not easy given the same information and behavioral hurdles — including straying from the consensus — as everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chance — good or bad luck — plays a bigger role in short term investment outcomes. Skill plays a bigger role in the cumulative outcome over many, many decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent investing is based on estimates of intrinsic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value investing looks for assets that can be valued based on fundamental factors like earnings or cash flows, which can be bought at a considerable discount to that value. Said another way, value investing looks to buy stocks with a current value significantly higher than its current price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger the discount between price and value, the wider the margin of safety. A margin of safety brings added protection from unexpected events, being wrong, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing is a waiting game. In other words, waiting is a big part of any strategy, be it value, growth, etc. Perfectly timed stock purchases don’t happen without a lot of luck. Investors have no control over how quickly the market corrects a misalignment between value and price. Waiting is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting inevitably means investors are bound to look wrong often. But if the judgment of intrinsic value is correct, then it’s only temporary. That means being comfortable with losses. Fear of looking wrong, being uncomfortable with losses, is what gets investors into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proper valuation, made with confidence, is the best defense against emotional decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large margin of safety makes selling at the right price less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market prices are largely affected by psychology and technicals in the short term. Investors’ psychology can produce wild price swings in the short run. Understanding psychology is key to being able to take advantage of it. Controlling your own emotion is also key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great opportunities arise when buying from forced sellers. That means don’t become a forced seller. - Build a strategy that avoids forced selling at any price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “good” stock can produce losses if you overpay. A “bad” stock can produce gains when bought cheap. An “overpriced” stock can go higher. An “underpriced” stock can go lower. But eventually, valuation does matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roads to Investment Profits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase Intrinsic Value: It’s difficult to predict. Often any potential increase is already priced in. To profit, the actual increase in value must exceed the market’s — the consensus — expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply Leverage: A “good” investment doesn’t become a “great” investment with leverage. Leverage only magnifies gains and losses. It increases the risk of ruin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell an Asset for More Than Its Worth: It requires a greater fool to come along and overpay for your asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy an Asset for Less Than Its Worth: One of the most reliable ways to profit…so long as you’re willing to wait. Even so, it’s not always guaranteed to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk results from an unknowable future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding or minimizing risk is a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment decisions should always consider the risk involved and potential return. Then determine if the return justifies the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riskier investments have a wider range of outcomes and more uncertainty around where the outcome falls. In other words, uncertainty means riskier investments can have high returns, low returns, or even a loss. And the probability distribution may be impossible to predict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk = the possibility of permanent loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Types of Risk to Watch for:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falling Short of Your Goals: investing is personal. It’s usually done with specific goals in mind like retirement, college education, etc. Not meeting those goals poses a risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benchmark Risk: is an unwillingness to underperform a popular benchmark index, like the S&amp;#x26;P 500, in the short term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career Risk: when a fund manager’s investment decisions are based more on keeping their job than the outcome of their funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconventionality: the risk of being different. Investing differently than the market often leads to returns that deviate from the market — not always in a good way. Being unconventional can get people fired or lead to market-beating returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illiquidity: liquidity is the ability to turn assets into cash without sacrificing on price. The risk is not being able to do that when cash is needed most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk is a function of price and value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of loss can be caused by strong or weak fundamentals depending on the price paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of loss is possible under a strong or weak economic environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk is often an educated guess. It’s also difficult to measure in hindsight. Every investment has a range of outcomes. It’s impossible to measure risk knowing the outcome that did occur, without also knowing all the alternative outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Randomness and luck play a role in individual investment outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most investors make decisions with the expectation that the future will mirror the past and underestimate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worst-case projections are often based on what we know through history and fail to consider that something worse than what’s already happened, can happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk is uncertainty in the possibility that loss occurs out of all the possible outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High risk and low returns due to high prices are one and the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk tolerance, for the average investor, tends to move opposite of stock prices. As prices rise too high, investors become less risk-averse (more risk-tolerant) when they should be more risk-averse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many market bubbles were blown under the belief that something has no risk. Risk exists in every investment. The belief in no risk stems from widespread investor behavior that’s extremely optimistic and risk-averse. It’s a danger to watch out for. Risk is highest when the belief risk doesn’t exist is widespread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things to watch out for when risk is highest is excessive optimism, nonexistent skepticism, easy credit, strong capital inflows, low returns on “safe” investments,  recent high returns on typically “unsafe” investments, and a belief that those returns will stay high going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In most cases, people are overconfident in their ability to see risk and avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “Perversity of Risk” = “When investors feel risk is high, their actions serve to reduce risk. But when investors believe risk is low, they create dangerous conditions. The market is dynamic rather than static, and it behaves in ways that are counterintuitive.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk is often highest when the consensus believes it is lowest and vice versa. When the consensus believes an investment is risky and refuses to own it, their unwillingness likely reduces its price to a point where risk is lowest. The opposite is also true. When the consensus believes an investment is risk-free and everyone owns it, that enthusiastic demand has driven its price to a point where risk is highest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best investors earn asymmetrical returns to the risk they take. They often have a track record of avoiding disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk management — risk control — is essential even when a potential risk isn’t obvious. It usually means forgoing some return to avoid any potential loss, even if the loss is never realized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s important to remember that history is only a rough guide to what’s possible. Better and worse outcomes can occur. Outliers are possible that break entirely from historical norms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economies, markets, and businesses rise and fall. It’s partially due to the involvement of people. Other factors are involved too but people reacting to those factors play a big role in the swings of cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Cycle: “Prosperity brings expanded lending, which leads to unwise lending, which produces large losses, which makes lenders stop lending, which ends prosperity, and on and on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistake investors often make is believing a trend will continue, that a company will do well forever, and that the cycle is broken. Reversion is far more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets resemble a perpetual pendulum, swinging back and forth between two extremes. At one extreme are euphoria, greed, optimism, risk-tolerance, and overpriced assets. At the other are depression, fear, pessimism, risk-aversion, and underpriced assets. The pendulum never stops at the midpoint of its swing or the “average.” It’s always swinging through it, towards one extreme or the other. It’s the swing of the pendulum that’s dependable. What’s less dependable — that keeps everyone guessing — is the rate, the speed, and power of the swing. We never know how far it swings, what causes it to reverse (or when or how quickly it reverses), and how far it swings back in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary risks in investing: Losing money and missed opportunities. It requires a balancing act for any portfolio (can’t eliminate both).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Stages of a Bull Market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The first, when a few forward-looking people begin to believe things will get better”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The second, when most investors realize improvement is actually taking place”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The third, when everyone concludes things will get better forever”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Stages of a Bear Market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The first, when just a few thoughtful investors recognize that, despite the prevailing bullishness, things won’t always be rosy”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The second, when most investors recognize things are deteriorating”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The third, when everyone’s convinced things can only get worse”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitraging human nature — exploited the common behavioral mistakes that lead to mispricing and inefficiencies in the market — can lead to above-average returns. Of course, it requires avoiding similar mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greed – the pursuit of profits above all else, without consideration of risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear – prevents investors from making rational decisions and taking rational actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Tendency to Dismiss Logic – when investors accept unlikely outcomes as probable because they would get rich quick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the Herd – people, in general, are more comfortable following a group than going it alone…even when they know it’s the wrong decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envy – people compare themselves to others too much…that includes returns. It makes it hard to watch others make more money in the stock market without eventually acting on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego – can lead to over-aggressive investing in the hopes of recognition, to show off high returns, or feel “smarter.” It leads to short term thinking. Humility is needed to keep the ego in check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitulation – the late behavior in all cycles is when the last holdouts give in and jump on the bandwagon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inadequate Skepticism – the recurring phrase “too good to be true” is repeated after every market bubble. A magically investment or strategy that produces high returns without risk doesn’t exist. A skeptic separates what’s too good to be true from what sounds good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of Being Wrong — when doubt pushes you to question your judgment on an investment because it declined in price (which is often the case when buying an underpriced asset) or you’re missing out on something that everyone else is making money on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All bubbles start with a grain of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrarianism means avoiding the repeated mistakes the herd makes at the extremes of the market cycle. The difficulty is in recognizing the extremes and then acting on it, knowing you’ll never time the bottom or top, or that prices can continue moving in the same direction longer than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the extremes, contrarianism is less likely to be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience might be the greatest teacher in recognizing the extremes of the market cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors must think in terms of probabilities when dealing with the future — what could happen and how likely is it to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to find bargains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something’s wrong — it looks bad on the surface like an over-leverage company, a failed project, or mismanagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misunderstood asset — investors don’t look deep enough to understand it and/or show a bias towards it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly unpopular – it’s ignored or scorned by the media, thus everyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controversial or inappropriate for most portfolios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s being sold the most?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, its price is falling — leading first-level thinkers to avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common mistake investors make is to equate action with adding value to a portfolio. Increased action usually just leads to overtrading and lower returns. Instead, investors should wait for the “best” opportunities to come to them — that they’re willing to act on — rather than chasing after things that add nominal value but carry more risk. This can be made worse by trying to create opportunities that don’t exist. Doing nothing is the hardest part of investing but often the most necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what you don’t know is essential to investing success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurately anticipating change is the most profitable but also the most difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of knowing what you don’t know is being careful with your own forecasts and those of others because nobody knows the future with absolute certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake investors make is forgetting the limits of their own knowledge. This includes mistaking the difference between probability and outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know the future, it’s best to be aggressive, make concentrated bets, use leverage, time the market, and ignore risk — all the things great investors warn about. Because the greats don’t know the future, they are defensive, diversify, hedge, focus on value over price, emphasize risk management, and prepare for multiple outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to figure out the future, try to figure out where we are in the market cycle, make adjustments if necessary when close to the extremes, and prepare mentally to avoid behavioral mistakes that plague investors throughout. The key is to watch for investor behavior that typically emerges, especially at the extremes of the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randomness or luck plays a bigger role in investing than most people want to admit. It’s how someone can bet on a long-shot lottery stock, win big, and look like a genius. But it has little to do with skill and a lot to do with luck. In the short run, any outcome is possible including the least probable. In the long run, bet hundreds or thousands of times, the total outcomes will approach what’s most probable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors’ decisions should be judged independent of the outcome because randomness allows for investors to make the wrong decision and still make money (or the right decision and lose). Process over outcomes is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good investment strategy essentially has a dial that can adjust the balance between “making money” and “avoiding losses.” Of course, turning the dial requires rational thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offensive investor is usually focused on aggressive investments/positions in order to outperform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defensive investor is usually focused on avoiding mistakes and not doing the wrong thing that leads to losses. For defensive investors, that means avoiding investments that have a high probability of losses and avoiding overexposure to big drawdowns in a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large margin of safety increases a portfolio’s tolerance for undesirable outcomes. A lower price — in relation to value — is the primary source of this margin. The lower the price, the wider the margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With stocks, the upside isn’t fixed like bonds. So the investor must find a balance between offense and defense. Obviously, they must play defense to avoid the losers, but must also play offense for the higher return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure of Imagination – Marks defines it as the inability to come up with a full range of outcomes and/or not completely understanding the consequences of those outcomes. Specifically, it’s in reference to extreme outliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding big losses means building a portfolio to protect from the possibility of unlikely terrible losses occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On asset correlation: “The failure to correctly anticipate co-movement within a portfolio is a critical source of investment error.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;george soros and reflexitity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“financial markets, far from accurately reflecting all the available knowledge, always provide a distorted view of reality. This is the principle of fallibility. The degree of distortion may vary from time to time. Sometimes, it’s quite insignificant, at other times, it is quite pronounced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Every bubble has 2 components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. When a positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, a boom-bust process is set in motion. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons from a Crisis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too much capital availability makes money flow to the wrong places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When capital goes where it shouldn’t, bad things happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When capital is in oversupply, investors compete for deals by accepting low returns and a slender margin for error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widespread disregard for risk creates great risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inadequate due diligence leads to investment losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In heady times, capital is devoted to innovative investments, many of which fail the test of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden fault lines running through portfolios can make the prices of seemingly unrelated assets move in tandem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychological and technical factors can swamp fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets change, invalidating models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage magnifies outcomes but doesn’t add value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excesses correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake investors make is selling at the bottom and missing the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any expectation of investment returns should be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every investor should have a return goal in mind, know the amount of risk they can tolerate, and the amount of liquidity their strategy requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When there’s nothing particularly clever to do, the potential pitfall lies in insisting on being clever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Asymmetry—better performance on the upside than on the downside relative to what your style alone would produce—should be every investor’s goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perfection in investing is generally unobtainable; the best we can hope for is to make a lot of good investments and exclude most of the bad ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most of these eleven lessons can be reduced to just one: be alert to what’s going on around you with regard to the supply/demand balance for investable funds and the eagerness to spend them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…we always think in terms of earnings yield (which is just the inverse of the P/E) rather than in P/Es; doing so allows for easy comparison to fixed-income alternatives.” — Christopher Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Short-run outcomes can diverge from the long-run probabilities, and occurrences can cluster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One way to maximize the asymmetry of risk and reward is to make sure you minimize risk. I’ve said this before in another place: if you minimize the chance of loss in an investment, most of the other alternatives are good.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investing scared, requiring good value and a substantial margin for error, and being conscious of what you don’t know and can’t control are hallmarks of the best investors I know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An investor needs to do very few things right as long as he avoids big mistakes.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In fixed income…returns are limited and the manager’s greatest contribution comes through the avoidance of loss. Because the upside is truly “fixed,” the only variability is on the downside, and avoiding it holds the key. Thus, distinguishing yourself as a bond investor isn’t a matter of which paying bonds you hold, but largely of whether you’re able to exclude bonds that don’t pay. According to Graham and Dodd, this emphasis on exclusion makes fixed income investing a negative art.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here is part of the tradeoff with diversification. You must be diversified enough to survive bad times or bad luck so that skill and good process can have the chance to pay off over the long term.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For good investors, as the time horizon expands, which allows skill to come into play, the probability distribution of long-term returns should narrow.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overestimating what you’re capable of knowing or doing can be extremely dangerous—in brain surgery, transocean racing or investing. Acknowledging the boundaries of what you can know—and working within those limits rather than venturing beyond—can give you a great advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what’s going on.” — Amos Tversky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of the biggest losses occur when overconfidence regarding predictive ability causes investors to underestimate the range of possibilities, the difficulty of predicting which one will materialize, and the consequences of a surprise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good times teach only bad lessons: that investing is easy, that you know its secrets, and that you needn’t worry about risk. The most valuable lessons are learned in tough times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beating the market matters, but limiting risk matters just as much. Ultimately, investors have to ask themselves whether they are interested in relative or absolute returns. Losing 45 percent while the market drops 50 percent qualifies as market outperformance, but what a pyrrhic victory this would be for most of us.” — Seth Klarman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First-level thinking says, “I think the company’s earnings will fall; sell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Second-level thinking says, “I think the company’s earnings will fall less than people expect, and the pleasant surprise will lift the stock; buy.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea is that agreeing with the broad consensus, while a very comfortable place for most people to be, is not generally where above-average profits are found.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Psychological influences are a dominating factor governing investor behavior. They matter as much as—and at times more than—underlying value in determining securities prices.” — Seth Klarman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human beings are not clinical computing machines. Rather, most people are driven by greed, fear, envy, and other emotions that render objectivity impossible and open the door for significant mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many of the best bargains at any point in time are found among the things other investors can’t or won’t do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let others believe markets can never be beat. Abstention on the part of those who won’t venture in creates opportunities for those who will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Warren Buffett says that the best investment course would teach just two things well: How to value an investment and how to think about market price movements.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to consistently do the right thing as an investor. But it’s impossible to consistently do the right thing at the right time. The most we value investors can hope for is to be right about an asset’s value and buy when it’s available for less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unless you buy at the exact bottom tick (which is next to impossible), you will be down at some point after you make every investment.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are two essential ingredients for profit in a declining market: you have to have a view on intrinsic value, and you have to hold that view strongly enough to be able to hang in and buy even as price declines suggest that you’re wrong. Oh yes, there’s a third: you have to be right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investment success doesn’t come from “buying good things,” but rather from “buying things well.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been demonstrated time and time again that no asset is so good that it can’t become a bad investment if bought at too high a price. And there are few assets so bad that they can’t be a good investment when bought cheap enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no such thing as a good or bad idea regardless of price!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investing is a popularity contest, and the most dangerous thing is to buy something at the peak of its popularity. At that point, all favorable facts and opinions are already factored into its price, and no new buyers are left to emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Risk means more things can happen than will happen.” — Elroy Dimson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most dangerous investment conditions generally stem from psychology that’s too positive. For this reason, fundamentals don’t have to deteriorate in order for losses to occur; a downgrading of investor opinion will suffice. High prices often collapse of their own weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the relation between different kinds of investments and the risk of loss is entirely too indefinite, and too variable with changing conditions, to permit of sound mathematical formulation.” — Security Analysis, Graham and Dodd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of the greatest losses arise when investors ignore the improbable possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big difference between probability and outcome. Probable things fail to happen—and improbable things happen—all the time.” — Bruce Newberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unusual and unlikely things can happen, and outcomes can occur in runs (and go to extremes) that are hard to predict. Underestimating uncertainty and its consequences is a big contributor to investor difficulty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The received wisdom is that risk increases in the recessions and falls in booms. In contrast, it may be more helpful to think of risk as increasing during upswings, as financial imbalances build up, and materializing in recessions.” — Andrew Crockett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Risk cannot be eliminated; it just gets transferred and spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The road to long-term investment success runs through risk control more than through aggressiveness. Over a full career, most investors’ results will be determined more by how many losers they have, and how bad they are, than by the greatness of their winners. Skillful risk control is the mark of the superior investor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rule number one: most things will prove to be cyclical. Rule number two: some of the greatest opportunities for gain and loss come when other people forget rule number one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding that cycles are eventually self-correcting is one way to maintain some optimism when bargain hunting after large market drops.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When things are going well, extrapolation introduces great risk. Whether it’s company profitability, capital availability, price gains, or market liquidity, things that inevitably are bound to regress toward the mean are often counted on to improve forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stocks are cheapest when everything looks grim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The desire for more, the fear of missing out, the tendency to compare against others, the influence of the crowd and the dream of the sure thing—-these factors are near universal. Thus they have a profound collective impact on most investors and most markets. The result is mistakes, and those mistakes are frequent, widespread and recurring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing is easier than self-deceit. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be true.” — Demosthenes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest investing errors come not from factors that are informational or analytical, but from those that are psychological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many of the mistakes I have made are the same ones that I had made before; they just look a little different each time—the same mistake slightly disguised.” — Joel Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rising prices are a narcotic that affects the reasoning power up and down the line.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tendency to compare results is one of the most invidious. The emphasis on relative returns over absolute returns shows how psychology can distort the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my view, the road to investment success is usually marked by humility, not ego.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage, but provides the greatest profit.” — John Templeton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investment success requires sticking with positions made uncomfortable by their variance with popular opinion.” — David Swensen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people seem to think outstanding performance to date presages outstanding future performance. Actually, it’s more likely that outstanding performance to date has borrowed from the future and thus presages subpar performance from here on out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are two primary elements in superior investing: seeing some quality that others don’t see or appreciate (and that isn’t reflected in the price), and having it turn out to be true (or at least accepted by the market).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investment is the discipline of relative selection.” — Sid Cottle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal isn’t to find good assets, but good buys. Thus, it’s not what you buy; it’s what you pay for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investment bargains needn’t have anything to do with high quality. In fact, things tend to be cheaper if low quality has scared people away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The market’s not a very accommodating machine; it won’t provide high returns just because you need them.” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Patient opportunism—waiting for bargains—is often your best strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

His diary recorded the effect the Great Depression, the economy, and financial markets had on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book covers the time period from 1931 to 1941.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Great Depression
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate performed almost as badly as stocks. Many properties were bought using 2 to 3 mortgages at the end of the 1920s. Foreclosures were common, but the illiquid nature of real estate and lack of buyers made it impossible for banks to sell, which contributed to later bank failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks and Savings &amp;#x26; Loan companies did everything possible to not go under. Roth recorded that they suspended payments on savings and demanded a 60-day notice on withdrawals. Runs were common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 prevented European countries from trading freely with the US. In retaliation, European countries raised tariffs against US goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vegetable gardens became popular to save money, which lowered the demand/price of produce and made it harder for farmers to make money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout 1931 and 1932 Roth repeats something similar to: “It hardly seems possible that things could get worse.” And it does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank closures and Savings &amp;#x26; Loan closures locally and nationally were initially a shock but became a common occurrence in the diary from 1931 to 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little money was in circulation due to bank failures and the inability to withdraw. Business was at a standstill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A moratorium on mortgages was considered in many states in 1931.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety deposit boxes replaced savings accounts for those who could get money out of the banks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;President Hoover believed a sense of volunteer charity and community service would take care of the unemployment problem. He believed the local governments were responsible to feed and employ workers and the federal government should stay out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank and Savings &amp;#x26; Loan passbooks became a currency of sorts. Passbooks sold as low as 30 cents on the dollar. Prices on passbooks were quoted in the daily newspapers and traded at local brokerage houses. Many people used passbooks to buy foreclosed property from banks and speculate in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roth noticed that roll-your-own cigarettes, pipe smoking, and packed lunches were ways people saved money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small gambling games became a popular pastime during the depression — Whiffle board, dime chain letters, betting on the number of stock sales or bank clearings on the day, crossword puzzle, Monopoly, etc. “People lost all confidence in the old virtues of saving. They were willing to bet small amounts in the hope of getting large returns. They wanted something to occupy their minds and they wanted some gamble to buoy their hopes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;England, Denmark, and Norway went off the gold standard in 1931.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan went to war with China in 1931.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Reconstruction Finance Corp. was created under Hoover in 1931 to lend financial support to banks, railroads, and other businesses but came too late for Hoover. It was used extensively under FDR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Postal savings accounts became another popular alternative to bank accounts. Postal savings accounts were limited to $2,500 and deposits could be converted to postal savings bonds that paid interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimates of 25% of eligible Americans were unemployed in 1932. Those who had a job saw hours and wages cut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of banks failed during Hoover’s presidency. Of that, 2,294 failed in 1931. Almost 5,000 small banks shut down during the 1920s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash was scarce. People couldn’t buy food, pay bills, businesses couldn’t pay workers, and banks wouldn’t accept checks they couldn’t cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Scrip” became a common cash substitute issued by local governments or businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double Liability – state governments mandated, in the early 19th century, that bank shareholders were liable for the amount of money invested and the value of the shares they owned. In other words, if the bank failed, shareholders could lose more money than they invested. The goal was to prevent banks from taking unnecessary risks with deposits. Widespread bank failures hit bank shareholders hardest and proved the rules were useless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks became desperate. In one account, they tried to raise funds by urging depositors to buy new stock in the bank with 25% of their deposits and the agreement to leave their deposits alone for a fixed period of 1 to 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farmers expanded their farms and bought new equipment, often by borrowing against their property, in order to meet growing demand during WWI. The Great Depression put an end to demand, farmers couldn’t afford to pay their loans. Farm foreclosures grew in 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 countries went off the gold standard by the end of 1931. France and US were the only two large countries still on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50,000 WWI veterans camped out in Washington D.C. to demand bonus pay in June 1932. Things grew violent in July after Congress rejected an early release of veteran’s bonuses. The veterans were driven out of the city by the army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local governments had little money to operate schools, courts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR was elected in November 1932 by a landslide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40% of home mortgages were in default in 1933. Farms were hit hard by foreclosure. It led to farmers protesting low commodity prices and sabotaging farm auctions — farmers showed up en masse at auctions to intimidate anyone who bid on farms, to ensure the farmer who previously owned the property won the auction. Many farmers repurchased their farms via auction for pennies on the dollar. States eventually passed moratoriums on foreclosures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US dollar suffered severe deflation during the depression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan Governor orders a bank holiday in the state on February 14, 1933, after the largest bank in the state failed. The order closed banks for 8 days. Upon reopening, banks limit withdrawals to 5% of deposits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maryland orders a bank holiday on February 25, 1933, with similar withdrawal limits upon reopening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio banks ordered a bank holiday and set 5% withdrawal limits on accounts on February 27, 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pennsylvania ordered a bank holiday on February 28, 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By March 1, 1933, eight states ordered bank holidays. On March 2, the total was up to 16 states. March 3, it increased to 22 states. FDR proclaimed a national bank holiday from March 6 to March 9. Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 on March 9. Banks are allowed to reopen based on how “sound” they are. Stock markets also closed for 10 days during the bank holiday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR begins his fireside chats in March 1933 to help explain the situation and instill confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail sales jumped with end of the national bank holiday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US economy stopped contracting in March 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR signed a bill allowing beer and light wines (3.2% alcohol) in March 1933. Prohibition (18th Amendment) was officially repealed on December 5, 1933. Legalized liquor didn’t help the recovery as much as many thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR signed an order to limit ownership of gold in April 1933. No one can own more than $100 in gold. Gold exports are also not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hitler comes to power in 1933 and immediately declares a boycott of Jewish merchants to worldwide outrage. — April 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflation is the new worry of the day (1933). Inflation worries make regular reappearances throughout the rest of Roth’s diary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Industrial Recovery Act was passed in June 1933. It was designed to eliminate unfair competitive practices and standardized wages and work hours between companies in the same industries. It also granted the right for workers to unionize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labor strikes became common in late 1933 as union workers demand higher wages. The National Guard are called and some end in violence and death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Federation of Labor saw its membership grow from 500,000 to over 4 million in less than 2 months ending Oct. 1933. It demanded a 30-hour work week and higher wages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civil Works Administration is created in November 1933 to provide federal jobs to the unemployed to build roads, parks, airports, etc. By December, 3.5 million people had jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail reports, in 1933, the best Christmas sales since the depression started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1933 saw a number of programs set up by FDR’s administration: FDIC and Home Owners Loan Corp. were two of the most successful. The FDIC federally insured bank deposits. Home Owners Loan Corp. allowed homeowners to refinance their home with a 12-year mortgage instead of the common 5-year mortgage and avoid foreclosure. The program refinanced about 20% of home mortgages at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR’s experiment devaluing gold begins in January 1934.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential signs of war in Europe on February 1934.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1934 saw an increase in union strikes — over 1,800 — for better wages and working environment. National Guard and police were often called in to break up the strike, ending in violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1935 saw FDR’s administration pass Works Progress Administration which employed 8.5 million people, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Social Security Act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany seized the Rhine Valley in March 1936.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were still about 12 million unemployed in April 1936.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR wins reelection by a landslide in November 1936.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany seizes Austria in March 1938.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;War breaks out in Europe. Germany invades Poland in September 1939. England and France declare war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR’s administration would shift to national defense and supply Great Britain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italy joins the war, allied with Germany, in June 1940 while Germany takes control of Paris. Only England is left. Air raids over London begin. People are worried should England also falls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan allies with Germany and Italy in September 1940.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Selective Training and Service Act was passed in September 1940. It requires all men aged 21 to 35 to register for the draft. 16 million men registered for the first draft in US history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDR wins his 3rd reelection by a landslide in November 1940.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany turns toward Russia in July 1941.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The war created panic buying of products in the US starting in 1939 to avoid potential rationing and embargos on products similar to WWI. First, it was cars and real estate, next was furniture, appliances, radios, then silk stockings, linens, and clothes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan attacks Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941. The US declares war on Japan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany and Italy declare war on the US on December 11, 1941.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Markets
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only around 2.5% of Americans owned stocks in 1929.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people at the time viewed real estate as the way to grow a fortune.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following WWI, the US helped rebuild Europe and became its primary supplier which kicked off a boom in the US. Things picked up steam after 1922 as new industries like electricity, autos, and radio, along with mass production, became more mainstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chain store retailers — Kroger, A&amp;#x26;P, and others — grew in size during the 1920s and knocked many “mom and pop” retailers out of business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florida’s real estate boom took off in 1925.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the ’29 Crash, stocks sold at 20x to 40x earnings, bonds paid 4% to 5% interest, and use of margin was widespread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the crash, business leaders, politicians, and newspapers urged people that stocks were bargains and the worst was over. It wasn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks were 30% lower one year later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate bonds sold at 20 to 30 cents on the dollar in September 1931.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who thought they bought bargains in 1930, watched those bargains get cut in half (at least) by 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congress started an investigation on short selling in 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks and commodities fell to the same level in 1899 in May 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Railroad sector averages hit the same level in 1904 on May 31, 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Railroad stocks were up almost 400% by September 1932 from their lows in July 1932.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market rose four months straight following the end of the national bank holiday in early March 1933. New brokerage offices began to open. Roth reports people buying stocks in the hope to make back losses from prior years. Markets would see record volume on the year in the back half of 1933.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market corrects in July 1933 after 3 straight days of losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. Panics: “1873-1879 Major panic. Recovery in 1879. 1880-1884 Good times. 1884-1885 Short panic. 1885-1890 Good times. 1891-1893 Falling prices and warning of panic. 1893-1896 Panic. 1897-1901 Good times. 1901-1902 Short panic. 1902-1907 Good times 1907-1908 Short panic but severe. 1908-1914 Good times. 1914 Panic threatened but stopped by war. 1914-1921 Wartime prosperity. 1921 Primary war panic. 1922-1929 Good times. 1929-1935 Panic.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federal Reserve sets margin limits at 55% in January 1936.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks sold at 30 to 40 times earnings in September 1936.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market continued to rise until September 1937. Black Tuesday hit on October 19, 1937. The market fell more than 50% from September to December 1937, down to the same level as 1935.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By March 1938, the stock market is back to the same level as in 1934.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market bottomed in June 1938.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks hit 2-year lows in June 1940.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock Exchange seats sold at $650,000 in 1929. A seat was sold in November 1940 for $33,000. Another sold for $27,000 in February 1941. Another sold for $19,000 in December 1941.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Tax selling” pushes the stock market down to levels not seen since 1938. — December 6 1941&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing Thoughts
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roth dances around the idea of market timing early on — i.e. getting out entirely at the top and back in at the bottom — before realizing the difficulty of predicting the turns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The beginning of a stock market movement usually is caused by the trend of business but in the end the movement is carried too high or too low — by the extreme optimism or despair of human nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A major risk should not be taken for a minor profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The investor must organize all the material around him so he can use it in a simple way. He must disregard the non-essential. He must discipline himself and realize that the investment of surplus funds is all-important and requires work and diligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both 1932 and 1938 indicate there is no sure way to catch the bottom of the swing because it comes without warning. When liquidation has dried up and the situation looks hopeless—that is the turn. Your guess is as good as anybody’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It becomes increasingly clear that nobody can predict the future behavior of the stock market. One day the results of the election upset it and the next day it booms because of some chance happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fools rush in to buy when the market is booming — the wise investor buys on darker days when he knows stocks are selling below value — and then holds on — confident that he cannot lose his principal and that sooner or later the market will come back and raise prices above their intrinsic value. To do this an investor must have liquid capital, courage and above all patience and ability to hold on and wait.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stock broker after 40 years experience said to me today: “The only people I know who ever made money in the stock market are those who bought for cash and owned the stocks outright. I do not recall a single margin trader who did not lose sooner or later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing is clear. Every speculator gets washed out sooner or later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Roth’s diary is a reminder that our economic security, individually and collectively, always rests on a complex interaction of market forces, politics, consumer perception, and the impact of unforeseen (and sometimes unforeseeable) events. As in so many other areas, those offering predictions for the future or even detailed readings of the present are often wrong because of incomplete information, flawed statistical models, or hidden agendas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has become popular to wear old clothes—to brag about poverty and how much you lost in the 1929 crash. It is almost bad taste to give a big party or to drive a new car.” — Sept. 1, 1931&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Banks are absolutely terrible in their insistence on payments on notes and mortgages. It is the old story of lending you an umbrella when the sun is shining and then demanding it back when it rains.” — Sept. 4, 1931&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Life insurance proved to be a cushion for me in the depression. Money borrowed on life insurance policies should be paid back as quickly as possible. It has so far proven to be the next best investment after government bonds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everybody demands cash — no checks are accepted. The Truscon Steel Co. paid its employees with checks drawn on a large New York Bank and the local banks refused to cash them. The check may be good today and bad tomorrow. Even certified checks are regarded suspiciously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 146 cities of the United States “scrip” money is being used or “barter exchanges” have been set up to exchange services for merchandise.” — December 1932&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past two years there has been an amazing change in American thought from cards and golf to national politics and public matters. Life has become simple. Women’s styles resemble the 1890s and even the bicycle is coming back into favor as a means of transportation.” — May 1933&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I started these notes it never occurred to me that the depression would last more than two years. We are now in the beginning of the seventh year and the road is not yet clear — with the possibility of inflation ahead. We seem to be emerging from the panic, industry is picking up, etc. — but so much of it has been created by artificial spending that it is difficult to know just where we stand.” — January 2, 1936&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just came back thru the stores on my lunch hour. People are spending money like drunken sailors.” — December 24, 1936&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Religious intolerance increases — and our country is swayed by European propaganda and subversive activities. All in all the world of 1940 is not a pleasant one. We can only hope that a better day is dawning.” — January 1940&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blackouts take place in New York and Los Angeles. Many false reports of invasion by Japanese planes.” — December 9, 1941&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To an older man it must have seemed inevitable that we were heading for a crash but to most of us it seemed that we were in a “New Era” which would never end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 1929 when the crash came all sorts of people were into the market on margins over their heads — doctors, lawyers, merchants, bootblacks, waitresses, etc. They bought stocks on tips, did not know what the company sold or made and did not know how to investigate a stock even if such a thought had occurred to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Magazines and newspapers are full of articles telling people to buy stocks, real estate etc. at present bargain prices. They say that times are sure to get better and that many big fortunes have been built this way. The trouble is that nobody has any money… From the extreme of speculation in 1929 people have now turned to the extreme of caution.” — July 30, 1931&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a great many instances fraud is shown on the part of bank officials who used bank funds to play the stock market. The whole banking fraternity is in public disfavor and many of them face prison.” — Sept. 29, 1931&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A portion of good old government bonds is the backbone of many an investment list today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All sense of value, optimism and initiative seems to have disappeared. That is why the depression period presents so many opportunities to the man who has the nerve to buy stocks and real estate and businesses when the outlook is the blackest.” — April 14, 1932&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“O.P.M. (Other People’s Money—or credit) are the three most powerful letters in business but must be wisely and moderately used. Most of the banks are now almost liquid and these vast resources will soon again be loaned out for business expansion. To use these funds for business expansion and yet with moderation is the height of good business management.”
“The bottom was reached in summer 1932 and the upturn gradually started. There had been so many false starts however that it was not until 1934-5 that people really realized that the turn had been passed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Florida in particular is absolutely flat since the land boom of 1925. Literally whole communities can be bought up with little cash.” — July 1932&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the last 30 days the stock market has given one of the most strenuous rallies in its history… There is no tangible explanation for this by way of industrial revival and yet there is plenty of optimism and feeling that this fall will see a turn for the period. In this 30 day period most of the popular common stocks have doubled and tripled in value. The entire list shows a 70% increase in value.” — August 1932&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Directly after the war period it became popular for small local concerns to expand by selling stocks to the public. In almost every single instance these investments have proven to be worthless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bankruptcy receiverships and foreclosures are rapidly cutting down the mountain of debt created during the boom… In the case of the large corporation it is often voluntary for the purpose of breaking leases and getting rid of large bond issues, cutting down heavy capitalization etc. I do not see how real recovery can come until this liquidation movement is completed, old debts wiped out and business showing a profit on the basis of present capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 1928 people were excited about big profits on the stock market: they read literature about investments, lived high and talked about the “new era.” Today their outlook is gloomy, they think the depression will never end, the stock market is an abomination, real estate is no good, everybody is cynical, etc. Just as the public was mistaken in its excessive optimism of 1928 I believe it is mistaken in its excessive gloom.” — February 1933&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stock market lays down stringent rules to curb the small speculator. Hereafter accounts under $5000 must be margined at least 50%. Pools must be reported.” — August 1933&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The street is full of stories of large sums of money made in the stock market. Most of these people bought stocks a year or more ago and held on grimly… Many of course sold too soon and took a small profit. The speculative fever has spread just as in 1929 and all sorts of people are crowding the broker’s office. Many stocks sell at 20 and 30 times earnings and a break seems overdue. Bonds pay only about 3% and because of this low return and because of fear of inflation much money has been switched to equities.” — February 1936&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I look back over the record of the stock market since 1932 many remarkable results can be seen. Stocks that sold at receivership prices are now selling at substantial values. Here are a few extreme examples showing quotations in 1932 and 1936. Phillips Morris Tobacco Co. 1/2 to 90; Sheet &amp;#x26; Tube 4 to 68; Republic Steel 2 to 26; Gen. Motors 10 to 70; Chrysler 6 to 100, etc.” — July 1936&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I re-read some of the predictions made by outstanding economists in past few years, I must laugh. They were all wrong. None of them foresaw the 1937-39 collapses…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Industry in a war boom — stock market stagnant — gov’t bonds bringing less than 1% and selling at a high premium — stocks low and selling at five times earnings” — February 1941&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The S.E.C. starts to break up the utility holding companies and their common stocks go to record lows.” — April 1941&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rules of conservative investment apply whether you buy real estate or stocks or bonds. Thorough investigation is the first necessity — safety of the principal — and it usually follows that only a fair return on the investment can be expected. To seek a high or unusual return means greater risk and speculation… A pretty safe rule to follow is to stick to the conservative investments. There are times, however, in a depression when cash money is king and many good investments can be purchased at a big discount.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As nearly as I can make out from a study of past panics, the cycle of business is always moving down toward a panic or up toward a boom. It rarely for long travels in a straight line… The wise investor will disregard the day-by-day fluctuations of the stock market or real estate market and base his buying and selling on these long periods of rise and fall. Above all, and I repeat it again and again — he must have liquid capital in time of depression to buy the bargains and then he must sell before the next crash. It is difficult if not impossible to do this but the conservative longtime investor who follows the general rule of buying stocks when they are selling far below their intrinsic value and nobody wants them, and of selling his stocks when people are bidding frantically for them at prices far above their intrinsic value — such an investor will pretty nearly hit the bull’s-eye.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again and again I am forced to the conclusion that in prosperous times a man must be cautious and preserve his capital and be careful not to over-expand his business or to go too deeply in debt relying on a continuation of good business to pay the debt. In time of depression a man can be brave and if the depression is nearing an end he can invest his money or expand his business or open a new business with confidence that he is facing 5 or 10 years of prosperity… Many great prosperous businesses were founded on the ruins of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Money should be invested not locally but on a national scale if possible, including stocks and bonds in companies located in other communities and operating nationally. Many wealthy families in Youngstown grew rich on only local industries and banks but they are pretty well cleaned out now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each day brings new and interesting stories of great fortunes wiped out in the past year… The stories run without end. It all comes to the same point. Every investor should at all times have a reasonable portion of his holdings in liquid securities that can’t shrink much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is my conclusion that the successful investor must cultivate the habit of “patience.”… I suppose the real investor would then have the patience and courage to wait until normal times returned before selling. Patience to wait for the right moment—courage to buy or sell when that time arrives — and liquid capital — these are the 3 essentials as I see it now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again and again during this depression it is driven home to me that opportunity is a stern goddess who passes up those who are unprepared with liquid capital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This seems to be the sound rule for obtaining wealth but it requires patience which few possess:
Live on less than you earn — save at least 10%.
Invest, don’t speculate so that none of the principal is lost. Re-invest the earnings.
Never sell a good stock unless the price is above its intrinsic value (as in 1929).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is said that George F. Baker, the New York Banker, will always buy sound common stocks when they are being offered below intrinsic value and then he will never sell them except for very good reasons. He looks for his profit in the growth of the company rather than in the speculative increase of the market quotation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just finished reading a book called Mellon’s Millions. In all their business ventures they conservatively built up huge cash surpluses during time of prosperity. When a panic came they were able to absorb competitors for a song. During prosperous days their corporations advanced steadily but during depression they advanced by leaps and bounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just finished reading a book entitled Our Mysterious Panics by Colman. He gives brief history of every panic from 1819 to 1929. Comes to conclusion that every panic is brought on by human greed and speculation instead of by complex economic cycles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“None of these people seem to know the first principles of investment — how to gauge the value of a stock or how to look for accurate information. They buy and sell on tips and since the market has been rising since 1932 they are coming out ahead. They lay nothing aside in bonds. I wonder how many of them will be able to get out at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Floyd Odlum and the building up of his Atlas Investment Trust. Started with $40,000 in 1924 — ran it up to a million in 1929. Sold out for cash and held on to cash until bottom of depression was reached in 1932. With his cash he bought heavily in “special situations.” Mostly in investment trusts hard up for cash. Stocks in these trusts were selling at less than 50% of the asset values… Assets of the Atlas Corporation are now over $100,000,000 and they have literally become private bankers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is funny how when the stock market is rising every piece of news is regarded optimistically and bad news is ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This depression has indelibly impressed on my mind one thing — and that is the value of having on hand sufficient capital to cover emergencies. In the investment field it means the difference between success or failure to have enough capital to buy bargains when they are available or to hold on to investments thru thick and thin and not be forced to sell at a loss. My experience as a lawyer shows that a large proportion of business failures are caused by lack of capital rather than by lack of technical business knowledge. Even in domestic life there can be no happiness without sufficient surplus to cover emergencies such as illness or death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To build an estate it is necessary first of all to get money by saving it and secondly it is most important to invest these savings so that they will increase and work for you without losing the principal. Most people learn the first rule and succeed in saving various amounts out of their earnings but very few learn the second rule — how to invest it so it earns a profit and yet not lose the principal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Somewhere in between the ultra-conservative man who is afraid to take even a legitimate risk and the avaricious gambler who bets on anything — stands the ideal investor who has learned to make his money work for him. He accumulates money first by savings — then he carefully investigates and weighs a dozen investments before he finally selects one to put his money in. He is willing to take a legitimate risk but is not willing to gamble… If he invests in stocks or bonds he will not follow blind tips or rush into a seething market with thousands of suckers — but in the quiet of his office he will carefully examine the earnings records of the company, its future prospects. He will seek advice if necessary and then buy only if he thinks the price is fair and the prospects good. He will hold on for several years and share in the growth of the company and will sell only if the company loses ground or if a stock-crazy public offers him much more for his stock than its intrinsic value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As long as human nature is the same and people like to speculate, it is probable that in the future, economic booms and depressions will come and go as in the past.”
“During the past depression prominent bankers, businessmen, etc. were all wrong in most of their predictions. Use your own judgment and do your own thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more I see of the recent stock market slump the more I am impressed with the fact that the American people look upon the stock market as a place to gamble and not to invest. In times of rising market the average American becomes over-optimistic: he invests his whole capital in common stocks of the most speculative variety; often extends himself on margin. Then when a slump comes he finds himself over-extended; no cash reserve to fall back upon; he becomes unduly pessimistic and sells at a loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The average man who buys real estate for investment makes a careful study of the property, the location, the income, etc. and hires a lawyer to examine the title… That same man when he buys stocks either will not investigate because he does not know how or because he is lazy. He bets his money as in a horse race and does not feel his venture a success unless his money is doubled in a very short time. If the patience and care used in a real estate investment were used in making a stock investment, there would be much greater chance of success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is hard to always judge the exact place in a cycle but it is fairly easy to know whether we are in a period of great prosperity and speculation or in a period of blackness and despair. It is most difficult to know when the turn comes. It is best not to wait for the turn but to follow the simple theory of buying when a security is selling below value and to sell when above value.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Ruane&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Do not borrow money to buy stocks.” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You don’t act rationally when you’re investing borrowed money.” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I firmly believe that nobody knows what the market will do… The important thing is to find an attractive idea and invest in a company that’s cheap.” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I try to learn as much as I can about seven or eight good ideas. If you really find something very cheap, why not put fifteen percent of your money in it?” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I don’t know anybody who can really do a good job investing in a lot of stocks except Peter Lynch.” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Most people would be much better off with an index fund.” — Ruane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mohnish Pabrai&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biggest lesson from his parents: not seeing them get rattled after losing money multiple times. His father was an optimist, always founding new businesses that eventually went bankrupt. Losing didn’t distract his father from trying again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloning: Pabrai studied the best investors, figured out why they were successful then cloned (copied) their approach (studying is a huge part to make sure he clones the right things). He did for more than just investing strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He gets investment ideas by searching through 13F’s of the top investors, looks at the top holdings, studies the stocks, and tries to figure out why it’s a top holding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pabrai cloned Buffett’s 3 core concepts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying a stock means buying a piece of a business with a value, not a piece of paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That value of the businesses is not always reflected in stock prices (Graham’s voting vs. weighing machine). The key is to stay disconnected from the market’s craziness and patiently wait for mispriced opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy stocks only when it’s selling at a discount to that value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pabrai theorizes that Buffett’s online bridge playing acts as a positive mental distraction that keeps him from trading Berkshire’s portfolio. We all have a bias towards action that can use distracting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Buffett’s stock analysis: “What he’s looking for is a reason to say no, and as soon as he finds that, he’s done.” — Pabrai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pabrai’s Stock Filters (cloned from Buffett):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circle of Competence: Only invest in companies you truly understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin of Safety: Only invest in companies trading at a deep — “no brainer” — discount from its true value. “I have very simple criteria: if something is not going to be an obvious double in a short period of time — you know, two or three years — I have no interest.” — Pabrai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive Advantage: Look for better businesses rather than just cheap businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too Hard: Avoid companies with financial statements that are difficult to understand. It should be easy to figure out how the business makes money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He avoids companies based in countries with questionable shareholder rights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He avoids startups and IPOs. The added hype makes it less likely to find bargains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He avoids short selling because the upside is only 100% but the downside is unlimited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He ignores macroeconomics. It’s too complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He avoids meeting the management of companies he owns. Avoids being biased by sales speak and unreliable information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inner Scorecard: live by the standards you set for yourself and stop worrying about what others might think of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key isn’t to get rich, it’s financial independence — to do what you want to do without money constraints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Templeton&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templeton recognized early that a home country bias (investing only in the U.S.) was too limiting. He invested everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templeton bought stock in 104 U.S. companies, trading at $1 or less, in 1939 at the brink of WWII based on the theory that companies would see huge demand if war broke out. He invested $100 per stock. He made money on 100 out of 104 stocks — a total of 5x his money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templeton’s Principles:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware Emotion: “Most people get led astray by emotions in investing. They get led astray by being excessively careless and optimistic when they have big profits, and by getting excessively pessimistic and too cautious when they have big losses.” — Templeton
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploit the Irrationality in Markets: “To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are enthusiastically buying is the most difficult. But it pays the greatest rewards.” — Templeton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware Ignorance: Buy what you understand and never stop learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversify Broadly: “Don’t put all your money with any one expert. Don’t put all your money in any one industry or any one nation. Nobody is that smart. So the wise thing is to diversify.” — Templeton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be Patient: The edge is in waiting. Too many investors are too impatient to wait for opportunities and too impatient to wait for results to play out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find Bargains: “…study whichever assets have performed most dismally in the past five years, then to assess whether the cause of those woes is temporary or permanent.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid Fads: “The best way for an investor to avoid popular delusions is to focus not on outlook but on value.” — Templeton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templeton shorted 84 internet stocks, selling at triple its IPO price during the Dotcom Bubble on the theory that insiders would dump their shares after the lockup period ended. He bet $2.2 million on each stock ($185 million total) and made $90 million when the bubble burst. His strategy was to place short bets 7 days before the lockup expiration and cover the bets 10 days after expiration. He also had a rule in place to cover if the stocks rose a certain amount (to protect from excessive losses).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Howard Marks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay Humble: Marks reminds himself of the role luck has played in his life. He keeps a list of the lucky breaks he’s had to help him stay humble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find Inefficiencies: “The more a market is studied and followed and embraced and popularized, the less there should be bargains around for the asking.” — Marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy Cheap: “the essential question to ask about any potential investment should be ‘Is it cheap?‘”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets are Cyclical: markets, the economy, etc. follow a pattern of cycles. Yet investors tend to expect the current trend to continue in a straight line. They fail to see the trend reverting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He avoids forecasters (they can’t predict the future), market timing, and fads (rarely cheap).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always ask: How much optimism is priced in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marks collects examples of “stupid deals” to keep track of the frequency of craziness, greed, lowering of standards, etc. in markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“He asks himself questions such as Are investors appropriately skeptical and risk-averse or are they ignoring risks and happily paying up? Are valuations reasonable relative to historical standards? Are deal structures fair to investors? Is there too much faith in the future?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I always look at things in terms of ‘Where’s the mistake? Is the mistake in buying or not buying?’ ” — Marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Both in markets and life, the goal isn’t to embrace risk or eschew it, but to bear it intelligently while never forgetting the possibility of an unpleasant outcome.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Our performance doesn’t come from what we buy or sell. It comes from what we hold. So the main activity is holding, not buying and selling. I’ve always wondered if it wouldn’t enhance an organization to say, ‘We only trade on Thursdays.’ And the other four days of the week, all you can do is sit and think.” — Marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If your thinking is heavily colored by wishful thinking, then your probability assignments will be biased toward favorable… If you’re given to fear, then you’ll be biased toward the negative… No one is going to say, ‘This is my prediction and it’s probably wrong.’ But you must say, ‘This is my expectation and I have to be aware of the likelihood that it’s colored by my emotional bias.’ And you have to resist it. For me, that means not to chicken out when the going gets tough.” — Marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jean-Marie Eveillard&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eveillard followed Ben Graham’s philosophy: minimize risk because the future is unpredictable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He took over the SoGen International mutual fund in 1979 (part of Société Générale). It had $15 million in assets. It was renamed the First Eagle Global Fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He looked for a margin of safety of 30% to 40% and held over 100 stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On why he was diversified: “I’m too skeptical about my own skills and too worried that it could just blow up.” — Eveillard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fund’s returns were great until the Dot-com bubble. The fund underperformed from 1997 to 1999 and 70% of its shareholders left. Evelliard stuck to his strategy despite the pressure from shareholders, bosses, and career risk. Société Générale sold the fund in Oct. 1999. Evelliard crushed it from 2000 to 2002.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eveillard retired in 2008 and passed control of the First Eagle Global Fund to Matthew McLennan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;McLennan follows a similar strategy — looks for at least a 30% margin of safety and owns over 100 stocks in the funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Our goal is not to try to become rich quickly. It’s resilient wealth creation.” — McLennan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal directs every investment decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Risk: just because something has never happened, doesn’t mean it can’t happen. We must be prepared for the possibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We just want to acknowledge that there are things that may not play out so well in the future. You want to be structured to participate in the march of mankind, but to survive the dips along the way.” — McLennan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I happen to believe that everything is on a path to fade. If you think of evolution, ninety-nine percent of species that have ever existed are extinct. And businesses are no exception.” — McLennan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Businesses that were robust today won’t be robust in the future. Uncertainty is intrinsic to the system. It’s entropy — the second law of thermodynamics. Basically, things tend toward disorder over time, and it takes a lot of energy to keep structure and quality in place. So, philosophically, we have great respect for the fact that things are not structurally permanent in nature, that things fade.” — McLennan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets are biological. Businesses are born, evolve, and die. Investors should evolve (their thinking and strategies) along with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;McLennan builds his portfolio by eliminating anything that leads to mistakes — fads, countries with unstable political systems or a history of seizing corporate property, businesses with a high risk of tech disruption, excess leverage, complex financial statements, and questionable/adventurous management (he says no a lot). What’s left are businesses that tend to persist (and are generally boring) and avoid innovative disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What I observe in the world is that, if you can accept that stuff exogenous to you is in a state of flux, you can focus on your own endogenous equanimity. And what I see out there is most people doing the opposite. They’re trying to control that exogenous flux. They’re trying to predict. They’re trying to be positioned for it. And that causes a state of inner turmoil. So I think part of it is almost a very simple behavioral switch. It’s saying, am I philosophically willing to accept flux, complexity, and uncertainty, or not? And if you say, yes, I am, then I think it’s extremely freeing in terms of your ability to focus on your own equanimity.” — McLennan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irving Kahn&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Investing is about preserving more than anything. That must be your first thought, not looking for large gains. If you achieve only reasonable returns and suffer minimal losses, you will become a wealthy man and will surpass any gambler friends you may have. This is also a good way to cure your sleeping problems.” — Kahn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Considering the downside is the single most important thing an investor must do. This task must be dealt with before any consideration can be made for gains. The problem is that people nowadays think they’re pretty smart because they can do something quite rapidly.” — Kahn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joel Greenblatt&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenblatt started on Wall Street with a summer job at Bear Stearns. He made riskless arbitrage trades via options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founded Gotham Capital with $7 million in assets. Averaged 50% per year over the first 10 years and averaged 40% annually over the first 20 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly 80% of the fund was in 6 to 8 positions. Many were spinoffs, restructures, companies emerging from bankruptcy, illiquid small caps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He purposely kept the fund small (all investor money was returned after 10 years).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He looked for hidden value that nobody wanted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing has a complexity problem. It avoids simplicity. Be it in the number of investment options to choose from, the strategies available, MPT’s formulas and ratios, or behavior, people gravitate toward the complex over the simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Why is it so valuable to reduce investing to a few core principles? For a start, it forces us to think through what we truly believe.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I have a simple way of looking at things that makes sense to me and that I’m going to stick with through thick and thin. That’s it.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing (and life) should be a process of subtraction and simplification. Removing what’s unimportant and unnecessary to focus on the key principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Noise: “The way I look at it is, if I own a chain store in the Midwest, am I all of a sudden going to sell it for half of what it’s worth because something bad happened in Greece? I don’t think so! But that’s what you read in the newspaper, and that’s what everyone is looking at. If you have a context to say, ‘Well, does it matter or doesn’t it matter?’—it’s just very helpful.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“People are crazy and emotional. They buy and sell things in an emotional way, not in a logical way, and that’s the only reason why we have any opportunity.… So if you have a way to value businesses that’s disciplined and makes sense, you should be able to take advantage of other people’s emotions.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Valuation Techniques:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discounted Cash Flow: take the present value of estimated future earnings and compare to the company’s market cap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relative Value: compare a company’s valuation to similar businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquisition Value: an estimate of what another company might pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidation Value: estimated worth if company is closed, assets are sold, debts are paid, and what’s left is distributed to shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I like calculating the odds. Consciously or unconsciously, I’m calculating the odds on every investment. What’s the upside? What’s the downside?… I don’t think you can be a good investor without thinking in that way.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s easier to find bargains off the beaten path or in extraordinary situations that other people aren’t looking at.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You size your positions based on how much risk you’re taking. I don’t buy more of the ones -   I can make the most money on. I buy more of the ones that I can’t lose money on.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Pretty much everything we ever owned, we sold way too early. If you’re very cheap in buying, it’s hard to be as comfortable when something has doubled or tripled, even if it’s still good.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“One of the beauties of the pain that people have to take in underperformance is that, if it did not exist, everyone would do what we do.” — Greenblatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best strategy is the one you can stick to in good and bad times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Danoff&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed Fidelity Contrafund since 1990.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His investment philosophy: “Stocks follow earnings.” — Danoff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He looks for companies that can grow earnings at a high rate over 5 years because stock price will follow it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Do you want to win the game for shareholders and own great companies? Sometimes, to own a great company, you’ve got to pay a fair price.” — Danoff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Will once said to me, falsely, ‘Look, I’m not that smart and there’s a lot of information out there. So when I look at a company, I just ask myself: ‘Are things getting better or are they getting worse?’ If they’re getting better, then I want to understand what’s going on.’ ” — Bill Miller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Miller&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The world changes. This is the biggest problem in markets.” — Miller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s all probabilities. There is no certainty.” — Miller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I’m trying to get rid of the unnecessary parts of what I used to do… I don’t build models anymore. It’s just stupid. It doesn’t make any sense… For every company, there are a few key investment variables and the rest of the stuff is noise.” — Miller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Sleep &amp;#x26; Qais Zakaria&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started Nomad Investment Partnership in 2001 and retired in 2014. They charged a tiny flat fee to cover expenses, then 20% of the funds profits over a 6% return hurdle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both worked at Marathon Asset Management prior to starting the firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They started in “cigar butts” but quickly graduated to a concentrated portfolio of high-quality companies held for years (average holding period was about 7 years).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No shorting, no leverage, no active trading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information has a “shelf life.” Most of it expires in a few days, weeks, or months. They looked for information with a long shelf life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They purposely detached themselves from day-to-day market action. Even placed their Bloomberg terminal in the most uncomfortable location, a short corner table without a chair, to limit its use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We just read annual reports until we were blue in the face and visited every company possible until we were sick of it.” — Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where will the company be in 10 or 20 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s management doing today to make that more likely to happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What might stop that from happening?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the company improving customer relations with “superior products, low prices, and efficient service?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does management make sound capital allocation decisions to improve shareholder value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the company mistreat employees, suppliers, customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the company do anything that could hurt its reputation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Benefits of Quality Management: “If they’re thinking rationally and thinking about the long term, you can subcontract the capital allocation decisions to them. You don’t have to be buying and selling shares.” — Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale Economies Shared Model:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies that take advantage of economies of scale to grow revenue while lowering the cost of business only to share those cost savings with customers to further entrench their advantage over competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Increased revenues begets scale savings begets lower costs begets lower prices begets increased revenues.” — Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costco is an example. It deferred profits for customer satisfaction/retention and long-term growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to be founder-led companies where the founder is obsessive about small details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to prioritize the customer experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to be serial cost-cutters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to be very long-term focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.com.” — Jeff Bezos, 2005 Shareholder Letter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s all about deferred gratification. When you look at all the mistakes you make in life, private and professional, it’s almost always because you reached for some short-term fix or some short-term high… And that’s the overwhelming habit of people in the stock market.” — Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Russo&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I call myself a farmer. Wall Street is flooded with hunters — people who try to go out and find the big game. They fell it and bring it back, and there’s a huge feast and everything is fabulous, and then they look for the next big game. I plant seeds and then I spend all of my time cultivating them.” — Russo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He looks for companies with the “capacity to suffer.” They are built to survive tough times and outlast the competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Less jam today for more jam tomorrow, the three little piggies, etc, are childhood tales that inculcate thoughtful people with the message of deferred gratification. Society has, however, created endless reasons why decision makers mistakenly prefer more jam today even at the expense of jam tomorrow. Much investment opportunity arises from being able to take the other side of the short-termism bet. I have been blessed with investors who permit me to take the longer view.” — Russo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff Gundlach&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If I assume that I’m wrong on this, what’s the consequence going to be?… Make your mistakes nonfatal. It’s so fundamental to longevity. And ultimately, that’s what success is in this business: longevity.” — Gundlach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Gayner&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gayner manages Markel’s investment portfolio since 1990.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His goal is to find tiny habits repeated daily that lead to long-term success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If you want the secret to great success, it’s just to make each day a little bit better than the day before. There are different ways you can go about doing that, but that’s the story… Just making progress over and over again is the critical part.” Gayner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It struck me that we should think small, not big, and adopt a philosophy of continuous improvement through the aggregation of marginal gains. Forget about perfection; focus on progression, and compound the improvements.” — Sir David Brailsford, coach of the British cycling team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns, training, learning, etc., it all compounds!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Principles:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He looks for profitable companies with good ROC and little leverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality management with integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company can reinvest profits at a good rate of return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be bought at reasonable price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He wants compounding machines to hold “forever.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s been my experience that the richest people were those who found something good and held on to it. The people who seemed the least happy and the most frenzied and the least successful are those that are always chasing the next hot thing.” — Gayner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His portfolio is over 100 stocks with 66% in the top 20 positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You cannot control the outcome. You can only control the effort and the dedication and the giving of one hundred percent of yourself to the task at hand. And then whatever happens, happens.” — Gayner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Lountzis&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You need a maniacal focus to really be great at anything. Anyone who tells you that you can have everything all at once, you can’t. I mean, you don’t become Roger Federer by not playing tennis. It has to be consuming.” — Lountzis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All great investors, CEOs, athletes, etc. are practically fanatical about it (at the expense of other areas of their life). Fanaticism won’t guarantee success but being fanatical makes it easier to compete in a world of fanatics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He hoards information on the best in the business and investing world to read and reread. The repetition makes the lessons unforgettable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You can’t mimic them because you’re not them. Learn it and adapt it and modify it into your own process.” — Lountzis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charlie Munger&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He constantly tries to avoid stupidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Other people are trying to be smart. All I’m trying to be is non-idiotic. I find that all you have to do to get ahead in life is to be non-idiotic and live a long time. It’s harder to be non-idiotic than most people think.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Attacking Problems via Inversion: “It’s counterintuitive that you go at the problem backward. If you try and be smart, it’s difficult. If you just go around and identify all of the disasters and say, ‘What caused that?’ and try to avoid it, it turns out to be a very simple way to find opportunities and avoid troubles.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to avoid stupidity is to ask: How bad will this be? Instead of, How great will this be? Or about investing more broadly ask: what are all the stupid ways people lose money? Then don’t do those things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Finding out what’s wrong and trying to avoid it is different from finding out what’s good and trying to get it. You have to do both, of course, in life. But this inversion of looking for the trouble and trying to avoid it keeps you out of a lot of messes… It’s a precaution. It’s like a checklist before you take off in an airplane.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“A lot of people are so interested in reaching for the prize that they don’t even think about the stupidities that might prevent them from getting it.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger collects examples of other people’s exceptionally stupid behavior. So can he learn from others’ mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common Errors:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening to market predictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying cyclicals at the top of the cycle or poor businesses at market tops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being close-minded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing things because “other people do it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rush to decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego, overconfidence, overoptimism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I know I’ll perform better if I rub my nose in my mistakes. This is a wonderful trick to learn.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Incentives: “If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason. This maxim is a wise guide to a great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Discovering Your Own Errors: “If Berkshire has made modest progress, a good deal of it is because Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don’t destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year.” — Munger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A systematic process of studying counterarguments, taking a devil’s advocate approach, or writing premortems (assuming disaster) are ways to limit biases and improve decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists of your biggest biases, emotional tendencies, and mistakes serve as a good checklist before making a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re going to be in this game for the long pull, which is the way to do it, you better be able to handle a fifty percent decline without fussing too much about it. And so my lesson to all of you is, conduct your life so that you can handle the fifty percent decline with aplomb and grace. Don’t try to avoid it. It will come. In fact, I would say if it doesn’t come, you’re not being aggressive enough.” — Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to be like a man standing with a spear next to a stream. Most of the time he’s doing nothing. When a fat juicy salmon swims by, the man spears it. Then he goes back to doing nothing. It may be six months before the next salmon goes by.” — Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joel Tillinghast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manages Fidelity’s Low-Priced Stock Fund since 1989, outperforming by roughly 4% per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He creates lists of things to avoid, “defensive principles and practices” that keep him focused and help outperformance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Don’t pay too much. Don’t go for businesses that are prone to obsolescence and destruction. Don’t invest with crooks and idiots. Don’t invest in things you don’t understand.” — Tillinghast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also avoids cyclicals, fads, heavy leverage, sales-y management, questionable accounting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He won’t talk publicly about his positions (makes it harder to change his mind).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If you want to be superior, that’s difficult. But what you won’t do is easier to control and more attainable… I’m not going to lose fifteen pounds. But saying no to doughnuts, that’s easy for me.” — Tillinghast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Thorp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“As far as gambling is concerned, if I don’t have an edge, I don’t play.” — Thorp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He heavily relied on the Kelly Criterion to size positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a chance to invest in LTCM but passed because they were “taking too much risk… So the probability of their ruin appeared substantial to me.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;“Learning to play poker or learning to play bridge, anything that teaches you to play the probabilities…would be better than all the books on the stock market.” — Lynch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templeton, Soros, and Buffett share “the willingness to be lonely, the willingness to take a position that others don’t think is too bright. They have an inner conviction that a lot of people do not have.”– Michael Lipper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A necessary characteristic of great investors is that they can’t be overly influenced by what other people think. The easiest way not to be overly influenced by what other people think is not to be that aware of what they think. If you don’t really notice that and don’t really care about what other people think, that will make it easier to be a great investor.” — Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Guerin tried to get rich faster than necessary. He was leveraged going into the 1973-74 crash, hit by margin calls, and forced to sell his shares in Berkshire Hathaway for less than they were worth (Buffett bought them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Other people are trying to be smart. All I’m trying to be is non-idiotic. I find that all you have to do to get ahead in life is to be non-idiotic and live a long time. It’s harder to be non-idiotic than most people think.” — Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Finding out what’s wrong and trying to avoid it is different from finding out what’s good and trying to get it. You have to do both, of course, in life. But this inversion of looking for the trouble and trying to avoid it keeps you out of a lot of messes… It’s a precaution. It’s like a checklist before you take off in an airplane.” — Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are so interested in reaching for the prize that they don’t even think about the stupidities that might prevent them from getting it.” — Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You need a maniacal focus to really be great at anything. Anyone who tells you that you can have everything all at once, you can’t. I mean, you don’t become Roger Federer by not playing tennis. It has to be consuming.” — Lountzis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been my experience that the richest people were those who found something good and held on to it. The people who seemed the least happy and the most frenzied and the least successful are those that are always chasing the next hot thing.” — Gayner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You cannot control the outcome. You can only control the effort and the dedication and the giving of one hundred percent of yourself to the task at hand. And then whatever happens, happens.” — Gayner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re even a slightly above average investor who spends less than you earn, over a lifetime you cannot help but get very wealthy.” — Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to swing at everything — you can wait for your pitch. The problem when you’re a money manager is that your fans keep yelling, ‘Swing, you bum!’” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We, and our judgment, and all mortal things go on flowing and rolling unceasingly. Thus nothing certain can be established about one thing by another, both the judging and the judged being in continual change.” — Michel De Montaigne&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook.” — William James&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, subtract things every day.” — Lao-tzu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uncertainty compels diversification. Diversification is and always has been the first tenet of the Prudent Man Rule of Investing… In sub-Saharan Africa, for centuries, people believed cattle were the safest repository of wealth. That was until the great drought came along.” — Barton Biggs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stock market is a sadistic, contrary, changeable beast and nothing is forever.” — Barton Biggs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The crucial question is whether the investor will, in fact, hold on. The problem is not in the market, but in ourselves, our perceptions, and our reactions to our perceptions. This is why it is so important for each client to develop a realistic knowledge of his own and/or his organization’s tolerance for market fluctuations…” — Charles Ellis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I call myself a farmer. Wall Street is flooded with hunters — people who try to go out and find the big game. They fell it and bring it back, and there’s a huge feast and everything is fabulous, and then they look for the next big game. I plant seeds and then I spend all of my time cultivating them.” — Russo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world changes. This is the biggest problem in markets.” — Miller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s all probabilities. There is no certainty.” — Miller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to get rid of the unnecessary parts of what I used to do… I don’t build models anymore. It’s just stupid. It doesn’t make any sense… For every company, there are a few key investment variables and the rest of the stuff is noise.” — Miller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you want to win the game for shareholders and own great companies? Sometimes, to own a great company, you’ve got to pay a fair price.” — Danoff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Will once said to me, falsely, ‘Look, I’m not that smart and there’s a lot of information out there. So when I look at a company, I just ask myself: ‘Are things getting better or are they getting worse?’ If they’re getting better, then I want to understand what’s going on.’ ” — Bill Miller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are crazy and emotional. They buy and sell things in an emotional way, not in a logical way, and that’s the only reason why we have any opportunity.… So if you have a way to value businesses that’s disciplined and makes sense, you should be able to take advantage of other people’s emotions.” — Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the market is precarious, you don’t have to know what the catalyst will be. You only have to know that there’s a vulnerability.” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Change is inevitable. The only constant is impermanence. We have to accommodate to the fact that the environment changes… We cannot expect to control our environment.” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only thing we can really count on in this uncertain world is human unreliability itself.” — Garrett Harden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people make the mistake of adding too much complexity to their lives. They skim the surface, preoccupying themselves with the superficial and the extraneous. As the best investors show, sustained excellence requires us to subtract and go deep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not borrow money to buy stocks.” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t act rationally when you’re investing borrowed money.” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I firmly believe that nobody knows what the market will do… The important thing is to find an attractive idea and invest in a company that’s cheap.” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I try to learn as much as I can about seven or eight good ideas. If you really find something very cheap, why not put fifteen percent of your money in it?” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know anybody who can really do a good job investing in a lot of stocks except Peter Lynch.” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people would be much better off with an index fund.” — Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m a shameless copycat… Everything in my life is cloned… I have no original ideas.” — Pabrai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are no prizes for frenetic activity. Rather, investing is mostly a matter of waiting for these rare moments when the odds of making money vastly outweigh the odds of losing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The number one skill in investing is patience — extreme patience.” — Pabrai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a person were going to own stocks and bonds, it would be much wiser to search everywhere, rather than limiting themselves to one nation.” — Templeton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to buy at a time when other people are desperately trying to sell.” — Templeton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a human failing to even put your mind on a question of which stock market is going to go up or down. There’s never been anybody who knew that.” — Templeton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m convinced that everything that’s important in investing is counterintuitive, and everything that’s obvious is wrong.” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He asks himself questions such as Are investors appropriately skeptical and risk-averse or are they ignoring risks and happily paying up? Are valuations reasonable relative to historical standards? Are deal structures fair to investors? Is there too much faith in the future?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always look at things in terms of ‘Where’s the mistake? Is the mistake in buying or not buying?’ ” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both in markets and life, the goal isn’t to embrace risk or eschew it, but to bear it intelligently while never forgetting the possibility of an unpleasant outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our performance doesn’t come from what we buy or sell. It comes from what we hold. So the main activity is holding, not buying and selling. I’ve always wondered if it wouldn’t enhance an organization to say, ‘We only trade on Thursdays.’ And the other four days of the week, all you can do is sit and think.” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If your thinking is heavily colored by wishful thinking, then your probability assignments will be biased toward favorable… If you’re given to fear, then you’ll be biased toward the negative… No one is going to say, ‘This is my prediction and it’s probably wrong.’ But you must say, ‘This is my expectation and I have to be aware of the likelihood that it’s colored by my emotional bias.’ And you have to resist it. For me, that means not to chicken out when the going gets tough.” — Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To lag is to suffer. It becomes psychologically painful, but also financially painful… After one year, your shareholders are upset. After two years, they’re furious. After three years, they’re gone.” and “It had gone on for so long that there were days when I thought I was an idiot. You do, in truth, start doubting yourself… Everybody seems to see the light. How come I don’t see it?” — Eveillard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To the extent that we’ve been successful over the decades, it’s due mostly to what we did not own. We owned no Japanese stocks in the late eighties. We owned no tech in the late nineties. And we didn’t own any financial stocks to speak of between 2000 and 2008.” — Eveillard
Matthew McLennan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why is it so valuable to reduce investing to a few core principles? For a start, it forces us to think through what we truly believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have a simple way of looking at things that makes sense to me and that I’m going to stick with through thick and thin. That’s it.” — Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I like calculating the odds. Consciously or unconsciously, I’m calculating the odds on every investment. What’s the upside? What’s the downside?… I don’t think you can be a good investor without thinking in that way.” — Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s easier to find bargains off the beaten path or in extraordinary situations that other people aren’t looking at.” — Greenblatt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want the secret to great success, it’s just to make each day a little bit better than the day before. There are different ways you can go about doing that, but that’s the story… Just making progress over and over again is the critical part.” Gayner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It struck me that we should think small, not big, and adopt a philosophy of continuous improvement through the aggregation of marginal gains. Forget about perfection; focus on progression, and compound the improvements.” — Sir David Brailsford, coach of the British cycling team&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwin Lefèvre’s fictionalized account of Jesse Livermore is a classic. It shares the timeless principles around trading in markets while warning of the biggest obstacle that plague speculators and investors alike — human nature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On bucket shop practices: “In the old days whenever a bucket shop found itself loaded with too many bulls on a certain stock it was a common practice to get some broker to wash down the price of that particular stock far enough to wipe out all the customers that were long of it. This seldom cost the bucket shop more than a couple of points on a few hundred shares, and they made thousands of dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What beat me was not having brains enough to stick to my own game—that is, to play the market only when I was satisfied that precedents favored my play. There is a time for all things, but I didn’t know it. And that is precisely what beats so many men in Wall Street who are very far from being in the main sucker class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is the plain fool, who does the wrong thing at all times everywhere, but there is the Wall Street fool, who thinks he must trade all the time. No man can always have adequate reasons for buying or selling stocks daily—or sufficient knowledge to make his play an intelligent play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions is responsible for many losses in Wall Street even among the professionals, who feel that they must take home some money every day, as though they were working for regular wages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A stock operator has to fight a lot of expensive enemies within himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know whether I make myself plain, but I never lose my temper over the stock market. I never argue with the tape. Getting sore at the market doesn’t get you anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It takes a man a long time to learn all the lessons of all his mistakes. They say there are two sides to everything. But there is only one side to the stock market; and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. It took me longer to get that general principle fixed firmly in my mind than it did most of the more technical phases of the game of stock speculation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have heard of people who amuse themselves conducting imaginary operations in the stock market to prove with imaginary dollars how right they are. Sometimes these ghost gamblers make millions. It is very easy to be a plunger that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All my life I have made mistakes, but in losing money I have gained experience and accumulated a lot of valuable don’ts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man must believe in himself and his judgment if he expects to make a living at this game. That is why I don’t believe in tips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is nothing like losing all you have in the world for teaching you what not to do. And when you know what not to do in order not to lose money, you begin to learn what to do in order to win.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The average ticker hound…goes wrong, I suspect, as much from overspecialization as from anything else. It means a highly expensive inelasticity. After all, the game of speculation isn’t all mathematics or set rules, however rigid the main laws may be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more I made the more I spent. This is the usual experience with most men. No, not necessarily with easy-money pickers, but with every human being who is not a slave of the hoarding instinct. Some men, like old Russell Sage, have the money-making and the money-hoarding instinct equally well developed, and of course they die disgustingly rich.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They say you never grow poor taking profits. No, you don’t. But neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tyro knows nothing, and everybody, including himself, knows it. But the next, or second, grade thinks he knows a great deal and makes others feel that way too. He is the experienced sucker, who has studied—not the market itself but a few remarks about the market made by a still higher grade of suckers. The second-grade sucker knows how to keep from losing his money in some of the ways that get the raw beginner. It is this semisucker rather than the 100 per cent article who is the real all-the-year-round support of the commission houses. He lasts about three and a half years on an average, as compared with a single season of from three to thirty weeks, which is the usual Wall Street life of a first offender. It is naturally the semisucker who is always quoting the famous trading aphorisms and the various rules of the game. He knows all the don’ts that ever fell from the oracular lips of the old stagers—excepting the principal one, which is: Don’t be a sucker!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In big bull markets the plain unadulterated sucker, utterly ignorant of rules and precedents, buys blindly because he hopes blindly. He makes most of the money—until one of the healthy reactions takes it away from him at one fell swoop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the big money was not in the individual fluctuations but in the main movements—that is, not in reading the tape but in sizing up the entire market and its trend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting… Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon. I found it one of the hardest things to learn. But it is only after a stock operator has firmly grasped this that he can make big money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man may see straight and clearly and yet become impatient or doubtful when the market takes its time about doing as he figured it must do. That is why so many men in Wall Street, who are not at all in the sucker class, not even in the third grade, nevertheless lose money. The market does not beat them. They beat themselves, because though they have brains they cannot sit tight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disregarding the big swing and trying to jump in and out was fatal to me. Nobody can catch all the fluctuations. In a bull market your game is to buy and hold until you believe that the bull market is near its end. To do this you must study general conditions and not tips or special factors affecting individual stocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most helpful things that anybody can learn is to give up trying to catch the last eighth—or the first. These two are the most expensive eighths in the world. They have cost stock traders, in the aggregate, enough millions of dollars to build a concrete highway across the continent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“..the average man doesn’t wish to be told that it is a bull or a bear market. What he desires is to be told specifically which particular stock to buy or sell. He wants to get something for nothing. He does not wish to work. He doesn’t even wish to have to think. It is too much bother to have to count the money that he picks up from the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Remember that stocks are never too high for you to begin buying or too low to begin selling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I am long of stocks it is because my reading of conditions has made me bullish. But you find many people, reputed to be intelligent, who are bullish because they have stocks. I do not allow my possessions—or my prepossessions either—to do any thinking for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To be angry at the market because it unexpectedly or even illogically goes against you is like getting mad at your lungs because you have pneumonia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…if a man is both wise and lucky, he will not make the same mistake twice. But he will make any one of the ten thousand brothers or cousins of the original. The Mistake family is so large that there is always one of them around when you want to see what you can do in the fool-play line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Losing money is the least of my troubles. A loss never bothers me after I take it. I forget it overnight. But being wrong—not taking the loss—that is what does the damage to the pocketbook and to the soul.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does not take a reasonably young and normal man very long to lose the habit of being poor. It requires a little longer to forget that he used to be rich. I suppose that is because money creates needs or encourages their multiplication. I mean that after a man makes money in the stock market he very quickly loses the habit of not spending. But after he loses his money it takes him a long time to lose the habit of spending.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The one game of all games that really requires study before making a play is the one he goes into without his usual highly intelligent preliminary and precautionary doubts. He will risk half his fortune in the stock market with less reflection than he devotes to the selection of a medium-priced automobile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a bull market bear factors are ignored. That is human nature, and yet human beings profess astonishment at it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a narrow market, when prices are not getting anywhere to speak of but move within a narrow range, there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be—up or down. The thing to do is to watch the market, read the tape to determine the limits of the get-nowhere prices, and make up your mind that you will not take an interest until the price breaks through the limit in either direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I sometimes think that speculation must be an unnatural sort of business, because I find that the average speculator has arrayed against him his own nature. The weaknesses that all men are prone to are fatal to success in speculation…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The speculator’s chief enemies are always boring from within. It is inseparable from human nature to hope and to fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man may beat a stock or a group at a certain time, but no man living can beat the stock market!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man can’t spend years at one thing and not acquire a habitual attitude towards it quite unlike that of the average beginner. The difference distinguishes the professional from the amateur. It is the way a man looks at things that makes or loses money for him in the speculative markets. The public has the dilettante’s point of view toward his own effort. The ego obtrudes itself unduly and the thinking therefore is not deep or exhaustive. The professional concerns himself with doing the right thing rather than with making money, knowing that the profit takes care of itself if the other things are attended to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man cannot be convinced against his own convictions, but he can be talked into a state of uncertainty and indecision, which is even worse, for that means that he cannot trade with confidence and comfort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of all speculative blunders there are few greater than trying to average a losing game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always sell what shows you a loss and keep what shows you a profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It cost me millions to learn that another dangerous enemy to a trader is his susceptibility to the urgings of a magnetic personality when plausibly expressed by a brilliant mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There isn’t a man in Wall Street who has not lost money trying to make the market pay for an automobile or a bracelet or a motorboat or a painting… In fact, of all hoodoos in Wall Street I think the resolve to induce the stock market to act as a fairy godmother is the busiest and most persistent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A great many smashes by brilliant men can be traced directly to the swelled head—an expensive disease everywhere to everybody, but particularly in Wall Street to a speculator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I learned that the weaknesses to which a speculator is prone are almost numberless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A trader, in addition to studying basic conditions, remembering market precedents and keeping in mind the psychology of the outside public as well as the limitations of his brokers, must also know himself and provide against his own weaknesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nowhere does history indulge in repetitions so often or so uniformly as in Wall Street. When you read contemporary accounts of booms or panics the one thing that strikes you most forcibly is how little either stock speculation or stock speculators to-day differ from yesterday. The game does not change and neither does human nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a bull market the trend of prices, of course, is decidedly and definitely upward. Therefore whenever a stock goes against the general trend you are justified in assuming that there is something wrong with that particular stock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Never try to sell at the top. It isn’t wise. Sell after a reaction if there is no rally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Among the hazards of speculation the happening of the unexpected—I might even say of the unexpectable—ranks high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I try to stick to facts and facts only, and govern my actions accordingly. That is Bernard M. Baruch’s recipe for success in wealth-winning. Sometimes I do not see the facts—all the facts—clearly enough or early enough; or else I do not reason logically. Whenever any of these things happen I lose. I am wrong. And it always costs me money to be wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The people who know what a stock is worth will always buy it when it is selling at bargain prices… But selling a stock down to a price much below what it is worth is mighty dangerous business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has always seemed to me the height of damfoolishness to trade on tips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The belief in miracles that all men cherish is born of immoderate indulgence in hope. There are people who go on hope sprees periodically and we all know the chronic hope drunkard that is held up before us as an exemplary optimist. Tip-takers are all they really are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Observation, experience, memory and mathematics—these are what the successful trader must depend on… He cannot bet on the unreasonable or on the unexpected, however strong his personal convictions may be about man’s unreasonableness or however certain he may feel that the unexpected happens very frequently. He must bet always on probabilities—that is, try to anticipate them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Experiences had taught me to beware of buying a stock that refuses to follow the group-leader.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am profoundly interested in all phases of my business, and of course I learn from the experience of others as well as from my own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…there is profit in studying the human factors—the ease with which human beings believe what it pleases them to believe; and how they allow themselves—indeed, urge themselves—to be influenced by their cupidity or by the dollar-cost of the average man’s carelessness. Fear and hope remain the same; therefore the study of the psychology of speculators is as valuable as it ever was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The principles of successful stock speculation are based on the supposition that people will continue in the future to make the mistakes that they have made in the past.” — Thomas F. Woodlock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sucker has always tried to get something for nothing, and the appeal in all booms is always frankly to the gambling instinct aroused by cupidity and spurred by a pervasive prosperity. People who look for easy money invariably pay for the privilege of proving conclusively that it cannot be found on this sordid earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the stock market, as in warfare, it is well to keep in mind the difference between strategy and tactics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Experienced speculators do not expect ever to engage in utterly riskless ventures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After a boom the public is positive that nothing is going up. It isn’t that buyers become more discriminating, but that the blind buying is over. It is the state of mind that has changed. Prices don’t even have to go down to make people pessimistic. It is enough if the market gets dull and stays dull for a time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In every boom companies are formed primarily if not exclusively to take advantage of the public’s appetite for all kinds of stocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The top is never in sight when the vision is vitiated by hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Stock Splits: “It is an old device in Wall Street—to change the colour of the certificates in order to make them more valuable. Say a stock ceases to be easily vendible at par. Well, sometimes by quadrupling the stock you may make the new shares sell at 30 or 35. This is equivalent to 120 or 140 for the old stock—a figure it never could have reached.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting angry doesn’t get a man anywhere. More than once it has been borne in on me that a speculator who loses his temper is a goner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The speculator’s deadly enemies are: Ignorance, greed, fear and hope. All the statute books in the world and all the rules of all the Exchanges on earth cannot eliminate these from the human animal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In addition to trying to determine how to make money one must also try to keep from losing money. It is almost as important to know what not to do as to know what should be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When a stock keeps on going down you can bet there is something wrong with it, either with the market for it or with the company. If the decline were unjustified the stock would soon sell below its real value and that would bring in buying that would check the decline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a bull market and particularly in booms the public at first makes money which it later loses simply by overstaying the bull market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No matter how experienced a trader is the possibility of his making losing plays is always present because speculation cannot be made 100 percent safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;an owner-occupied investment property is a home that has been purchased as an investment but that also functions as a primary residence for the investor. Because America loves homeowners, investing in real estate that doubles as a home satisfies the country’s love of homeownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can consider a single-family home as an investment if you purchase it with the intention of using it as a real estate investment in the future or if you can build substantial equity by doing something like rehab and then parlay that equity into greater investments later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small multifamily properties, such as duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes, are eligible for the same American benefits as single-family homes. That is, they are low cost, easy to obtain financing for, and offer the potential to generate constant monthly income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FHA loan is a government backed loan that allows you to purchase property. However, it also has its share of problems, such as the Mortgage insurance premium that can really add up and the fact that you can have only 1 FHA loan at a time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;203k loan (renovation loan in canada) is a subset of the FHA program and allows the borrower to borrow money to pay for cosmetic repairs such as paint and carpet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the biggest difference between a regular 203k loan and a streamlined one is the extent of the rehab. The streamlined one can be used for smaller cosmetic problems, like painting, carpet, and smells, whereas the regular one can be used for structural changes, like moving walls or building additions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investing in real estate with partners to avoid large amount of money upfront&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your brand consists of yourself and your product.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your personal brand is built through 3 primary areas: reputation, knowledge, and experience. Use your gaps in knowledge as motivation to grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your BRRR approach requires you to develop a strong and consistent product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are 4 different ways you can partner
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equity partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;down payment equity partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;private lending partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before partnering with someone, you must speak with a CPA and a lawyer who specializes in this kind of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the main reason why partnerships fail is because of personality conflicts. In addition, differences in opinion and suspicion/trust issues can cause problems as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;home equity loan or line of credit can be used/borrowed to invest in real estate.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it generally has low interest rates, which is generally tied to the prime rate, but the interest rates are adjustable and high during inflation period, which is another risk to take into account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another risk you take is if you house’s value decreases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another strategy is to refinancing your load through the bank after the repairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another option is to get a business line of credit from a commercial bank or portfolio lender. This allows you to access the equity in your properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by using your home’s equity to fund your real estate purchase, you’re reducing the amount of cash flow you receive. Getting a good deal on the property is even more crucial to make up for this reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All investors are susceptible to behavioral mistakes that then leads to poor returns. Gray and Carlisle create a quantitative value strategy that exploits the typical investors’ flaws while building temperament into their model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“While the term quantitative likely conjures images of complex equations churned by powerful computers, it’s best understood as the antidote to behavioral error.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price and value are distinct but intrinsic value is less easy to define. It can only be estimated through some valuation model using past information to make future projections. Changing the projections changes the intrinsic value. In theory, investors can twist valuation models to their will by tweaking the inputs…and they often do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The behavioral argument for value: investors project recent poor earnings into the future, stock prices fall with the projections and overreaction to bad news, until selling drives stocks to be undervalued. Value investors best against the overreaction to bad news and assumed continued poor performance, by buying underpriced stocks that go on to beat the market. To most investors, value stocks appear to be riskier than they really are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Graham’s Simple Quant Strategy:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What’s needed is, first, a definite rule for purchasing which indicates a priori that you’re acquiring stocks for less than they’re worth. Second, you have to operate with a large enough number of stocks to make the approach effective. And finally, you need a very definite guide for selling.” — Ben Graham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio with a minimum of 30 stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E &amp;#x3C; 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt-to-Equity &amp;#x3C; 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell each stock after a 50% return or after 2 years, whichever comes sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham estimated a 15% annual return (backtested from 1976 to 2011 exceeded Graham’s estimates by about 2%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But why? Because the strategy was followed — absent fear and greed, during years of underperformance — consistently to the letter. Temperament is built into the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Systematic behavioral biases create opportunities for investors who can find a way to control their innate weaknesses.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studies show that experts underperform or can do no better than simple models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All investors are biased in some way. Rather than trying to correct the flaws, why not build a strategy that protects from the flaws. The same strategy can also be built to exploit the flaws of others, providing the necessary edge to outperform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Even once we are aware of our biases, we must recognize that knowledge does not equal behavior. The solution lies in designing and adopting an investment process that is at least partially robust to behavioral decision-making errors.” — James Montier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross Profitability (GPA)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A proxy measure for Quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPA = (Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold)/Total Assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The farther down the income statement one goes, the more polluted profitability measures become, and the less related they are to true economic profitability. For example, a firm that has both lower production costs and higher sales than its competitors is unambiguously more profitable. Even so, it can easily have lower earnings than its competitors. If the firm is quickly increasing its sales through aggressive advertising, or commissions to its sales force, these actions can, even if optimal, reduce its bottom line income below that of its less profitable competitors. Similarly, if the firm spends on research and development to further increase its production advantage, or invests in organizational capital that will help it maintain its competitive advantage, these actions result in lower current earnings. Moreover, capital expenditures that directly increase the scale of the firm’s operations further reduce its free cash flows relative to its competitors. These facts suggest constructing the empirical proxy for productivity using gross profits.” — Robert Novy-Marx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of the book is a good example for thinking about how a quant value strategy might be structured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Permanent Loss of Capital&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove companies with the potential for earnings manipulation and fraud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first place to look is accruals used to manipulate earnings to look better than reality. The goal is to avoid stocks showing the illusion of quality earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Interestingly, simply measuring net income against cash flow captures many of the earnings manipulations, and, as it turns out, is predictive of future returns.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beneish M-Score looks at manipulation from the view of probability based on characteristics found in past financial manipulators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove companies with a high chance of distress or bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altman Z-Score uses a combination of five ratios to determine a likelihood of bankruptcy (a score below 1.81 = bankrupt, above 1.81 = not bankrupt).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Z-Score was built for manufacturing companies, showing a need for a model that adjusts for industry accounting conventions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“…stocks with higher leverage, lower profitability, lower market capitalization, lower past stock returns, more volatile past stock returns, lower cash holdings, lower price-to-book ratios, and lower prices per share are more likely to file for bankruptcy, be delisted, or receive a “D” rating… Investors should be aware that stocks with a high risk of failure tend to deliver particularly poor returns, and at heightened risk.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Cheap Quality&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett’s “wonderful business” presents a high return on capital in excess of market rates of return and over an extended time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross Profitability  or GPA = (Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold)/Total Assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on Capital or ROC = EBIT/Capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two above measures of quality don’t account for price. That introduces a problem — mean reversion. 1) It confused stocks at the peak of a business cycle with franchises. 2) Businesses with high returns on capital draw competition. In both cases, high returns erode and mean revert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One way to filter out franchises from companies at peak business cycle is to look at metrics averaged over the long term — long enough to account for a full business cycle. Franchises should show more consistent stable returns over the full cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“A consistently high, stable profit margin indicates the presence of a franchise.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piotroski F-Score looks for cheap but financially strong companies — looking at 1) profitability, 2) leverage, liquidity, and funding source, and 3) operating efficiency — where higher F-score = higher financial strength. Piotroski found that eliminating financially weak companies improved overall returns (the weakest, underperformed the market). The F-Score tends to produce more small and mid-cap stocks than large caps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Cheap Price&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several ratios can be used as a proxy for value: E/P, EBIT/EV, EBITDA/EV, FCF/EV, Gross Profits/EV, B/M were backtested in the book. EBIT/EV, EBITDA/EV, and GP/EV were the most robust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cheapest decile of each outperformed the market. The most expensive decile of each performed the worst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normalizing the “earnings” in the ratios over multiple years, versus the single year, didn’t produce better results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A composite of all the ratios is another idea, reducing the chance of any single ratio lagging over a longer period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Supporting Signals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buyback Yield = companies that reduced outstanding shares the most in a year, outperformed the market. Companies issuing the most shares in a year underperformed the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insider Transactions = there’s only one reason insiders buy, but many reasons insiders sell. But its more nuanced than that. “Opportunistic” (i.e. irregular compared to “routine” trades) insider buying generated market-beating returns for the insider. Other things to look for are larger purchases on an absolute basis, or multiple irregular purchases over several months, or purchases while the company is buying back stock, or purchases in “value” stocks. Each could be a sign of higher conviction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activists = stocks targeted by activist investors tend to beat the market, after the initial Schedule 13D notice. The outperformance may last into the second year, possibly because management agrees to the activist’s recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloning is another option where you basically, ride the coattails of other successful investors by following them through 13F filing. But, you have to be able to find skilled investors who will continue to beat the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short Interest = a basket of lightly shorted stocks outperformed the market, highly shorted stocks fell short of the market. Avoiding highly shorted stocks, in a long-only portfolio, is another filter to consider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the K.I.S.S. method (Keep It Simple, Stupid) when building a strategy. More information is likely to increase confidence more than accuracy. The end result is overconfidence not better performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“As investors, we should favor simplicity over complexity, but as humans, we seem behaviorally destined to prefer complexity.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Did you like what the model said or did you not like what the model said? That is a hard thing to backtest. If you are going to trade using models, you just slavishly use the models; you do whatever the hell it says no matter how smart or dumb you think it might be at that moment.” — Jim Simons&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A consistently high, stable profit margin indicates the presence of a franchise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, simply measuring net income against cash flow captures many of the earnings manipulations, and, as it turns out, is predictive of future returns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the term quantitative likely conjures images of complex equations churned by powerful computers, it’s best understood as the antidote to behavioral error.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s needed is, first, a definite rule for purchasing which indicates a priori that you’re acquiring stocks for less than they’re worth. Second, you have to operate with a large enough number of stocks to make the approach effective. And finally, you need a very definite guide for selling.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even once we are aware of our biases, we must recognize that knowledge does not equal behavior. The solution lies in designing and adopting an investment process that is at least partially robust to behavioral decision-making errors.” — James Montier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The farther down the income statement one goes, the more polluted profitability measures become, and the less related they are to true economic profitability. For example, a firm that has both lower production costs and higher sales than its competitors is unambiguously more profitable. Even so, it can easily have lower earnings than its competitors. If the firm is quickly increasing its sales through aggressive advertising, or commissions to its sales force, these actions can, even if optimal, reduce its bottom line income below that of its less profitable competitors. Similarly, if the firm spends on research and development to further increase its production advantage, or invests in organizational capital that will help it maintain its competitive advantage, these actions result in lower current earnings. Moreover, capital expenditures that directly increase the scale of the firm’s operations further reduce its free cash flows relative to its competitors. These facts suggest constructing the empirical proxy for productivity using gross profits.” — Robert Novy-Marx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Money Game is a series of stories on the games people play with money and markets. Told by Adam Smith (aka George Goodman), the stories uncover the emotion, error, myth, and irrationality that surrounds it all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynes was one of the first to describe the markets as a game, one that is “intolerably boring and over-exacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct; while he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game can be defined several ways: 1) something done as sport or fun; a diversion of sorts to keep things interesting, or 2) something more along the lines game theory, through math and weighing probabilities to decide on the most likely outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market — investing — is the greatest game of all. Because investing is “an exercise in mass psychology, in trying to guess better than the crowd how the crowd will behave.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the game is to make money, but for some, the goal is only about playing the game. (Of course, in order to play the game, you have to play in a way so that you always stay in the game.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask a dozen people the value of a stock and you’ll get a dozen answers. It’s best to view stock valuation as a range, instead of a fixed price. The factors that give a stock a value and price come partially from the financial statement, and mostly from the mood of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mood is what makes a system, a theory, a strategy, or a rational view on markets imperfect, imprecise, sometimes wrong, and irrational. Mood makes markets biological, complex, and in a constant state of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to know yourself. You have to be observant and honest and learn from mistakes. The decisions made around investing paint a portrait of who we are — biases and all. It’s better to figure it out, learn from it, and use it to our advantage, then to ignore it, fight against it, and fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Rule #1&lt;/strong&gt;: “If you don’t know who you are, this is an expensive place to find out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional maturity, remaining calm, keeping your cool, discipline, and patience are all used to describe a way of being in highly emotional, stressful, or anxiety filled situations. In other words, the markets. Succumbing to the stress and anxiety is why investing is so costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The crowd always loses because the crowd is always wrong. It is wrong because it behaves normally.” — Fred Kelly, Why You Win or Lose: The Psychology of Speculation, 1930&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone believes themselves to be a contrarian when really their part of the crowd. Also, human nature suggests most people find comfort being part of the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every bubble or euphoric period — from tulips to South Seas shares to Nifty Fifty to Dotcom stocks — must start with a rational idea. As the story spreads, the crowd mentality takes over, till it eventually peaks. Then every dip lower becomes a false buying opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Crowds are somewhat like the sphinx of ancient fable: it is necessary to arrive at a solution of the problems offered by their psychology or to resign ourselves to being devoured by them.” — Gustave Le Bon, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, 1896&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do they play the game? For many different reasons: the action, the image it presents, the sense of belonging (being in a crowd), being on the “inside”, the stories to brag to friends and strangers, basically, so they can say they play the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And few people actually play for the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the participants play the game differently. They make up their own set of rules and have a different definition of winning. And they often change the rules and the definition multiple times depending on how well they’re playing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greed and fear are the strongest emotions in the market. Nobody likes to watch others make more than them. And we hate losing more than like winning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those two emotions (along with others) have a huge impact on an investors willingness to change goals and time horizons. Hesitant, cautious, and timid at the bottom. Bold, confident, and audacious at the top. The exact opposite of what’s necessary for success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Rule #2: “The identity of the investor and that of the investing action must be coldly separate.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any sense of attachment or emotion to an investment can lead to a humbling experience for the most brilliant investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The most important thing to realize is simplistic: The stock doesn’t know you own it .” Nor does it care. Investing is the epitome of a one-sided relationship. Emotional connections don’t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detachment means you can change your mind or reverse course, without being tied down by prior decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of goals identified by numbers because it’s easy to fixate on a big round number and sometimes the goals — goalposts — often get moved by jealousy or envy or greed…or dreams. How many investors, despite big gains, hold on for “just a little more” and never got there. In the book, that’s the story of Harry, who could be anybody. He fixated on $1,000,000 because that was a life-changing number. He came close so many times, and took big risks (margin) to get there, but failed because anything less wasn’t enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trouble with high growth companies: they carry the seeds of their destruction. Unless the company has some advantage, the high growth attracts copycats. Growth is spread across competitors, prices get cut as they battle for market share, and profit margins suffer. And when that doesn’t work, there’s a point where growth falters because growth is finite. Companies grow too big to grow at a high rate and there’s no magic number that says when they hit too big. And then there’s the market. There’s no way to know the multiple the market would put on the growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adam Smith’s bias — Concentration: “Sweet are the uses of diversity, but only if you want to end up in the middle of an average. By concentrate I mean in a few issues only. There are, at any one moment, only a few stocks that have a maximum potential, and I, for one, am not smart enough to be able to follow more than a handful of stocks at a time… If you are concentrated in only a few stocks, you are forced to measure each of them in terms of potential against each new idea that comes along, and this in turn makes you bump the bottom stocks off — the worst-performing ones — to take aboard something more promising.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Rule #3: “Find smart people.”&lt;/strong&gt; Phil Fisher, the creator of the scuttlebutt approach, looked at his past successes to find that only one-sixth of them were found through scuttlebutt. The five-sixth, the rest, were from a network of smart people he knew and trusted. The downside: groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people choose to play the game as described by Keynes’s beauty contest: “We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.” So all kinds of systems have sprung up to figure out what is everybody else doing? Really, they’re finding out, what has everybody else done but never solving, what will everybody else do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why what is everybody else doing? Because it’s comfortable. If you’re doing what you believe everyone else is doing, you’re making money when they make money, losing when they’re losing, and risking about the same as everyone else. Doing the opposite of everybody else is often an uncomfortable place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If those systems, actually worked — could always predict what everybody else was doing — everyone would use it, and it would stop working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, if enough people follow a system, it becomes a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy…for a while. So if the system buys what goes up, then what is going up will continue to go up. — “Once it is accepted that the patterns can represent motion, it follows that a Trend is a Trend is a Trend until it stops being a Trend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotion is the last bastion that no one has figured out how to measure: “No one has yet learned how to put emotions into serial correlation coefficients and analyses of runs. It is absolutely true that statistically the price of a stock has no relation tomorrow to what it was yesterday. But people — the Crowd — do have a memory that extends from day to day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overreliance on mathematics imbues an expectation of precision in markets that are rarely precise. The more complex the math, the more speculative the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting standards and financial statements imply precision too, yet earnings can be manipulated up or down any number of ways. Example: there is no uniformity between companies on depreciation charges, amortization, inventory valuation, or goodwill. The implication: using complex math and “manipulated” financial statements to unearth things like precise earnings or growth trends is impossible. Investing is more art than science, so treat it as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is almost every investor, broker, analyst takes the accounting numbers at face value and rarely spends/has the time to look past the image management wants to project to see what’s being manipulated, why, and what it really means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote above refers to the conglomerate craze of the ’60s — see ITT and TLV — that used acquisitions to show earnings growth and accounting trickery to hide the real losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has always been a They in markets, which Smith refers to as elephants, that move markets at a whim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Depression: “It is a sobering experience to read through—as once I did—all the Wall Street Journals and Barron’s from 1929 to 1933. Quarterly, reports came out saying, ‘the outlook is favorable,’ ‘a sustained recovery is on its way,’ and so on. But nobody was listening. Those on margin had been sold out in 1929 and 1930. But from 1930 to 1933, a real blight of the spirit took place.” From 1929 to 1933, the Dow fell almost 90%. The Depression described the economy and the mood at the time. Much like what Smith describes, the book Oh Yeah!, published in 1932, relays a lot of the forced optimism from CEOs and the government who repeated said a recovering was right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity, or lack thereof, is the biggest threat to short-term performance chasers. If everyone wants to get out, and no one is buying, losses pile up fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk to funds managers includes optics: how does it look to own big losers, how does it look to own winners, how does it look sitting on a big pile of cash while the market rises. It’s career risk. Not many are willing to bet their jobs by looking wrong or dumb in the short term, even if looking wrong produces great results in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end-of-the-worlders, doomsayers, and gold-bugs have existed in markets forever and their calls will never cease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is how the game is scored…a path to being rich. The conundrum lies in how you define rich. You can treat it as a possession to see who can collect the most or you treat it as a means to an end, the means being financial freedom and enjoyment of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The market does not follow logic, it follows some mysterious tides of mass psychology.”
The mass psychology has a way of taking hold of every new generation of investors because they’re too young to remember to any bad times and they’re undefeated in the current market. So they fall in love with “the New Math, the New Economics, and the New Market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most brilliant and perceptive analysis you can do may sit there until someone else believes it too, for the object of the game is not to own some stock, like a faithful dog, which you have chosen, but to get to the piece of paper ahead of the crowd. Value is not only inherent in the stock; to do you any good, it has to be value that is appreciated by others… If you are in the right thing at the wrong time, you may be right but have a long wait; at least you are better off than coming late to the party. You don’t want to be on the dance floor when the music stops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Markets are only a tiny facet of society, but being made by mass psychology, they are a good litmus paper for what is going on. Markets only work when they believe, and this confidence is based on the idea that men can manage their affairs rationally. The longest period of prosperity in the last few hundred years came when everyone believed that the king was on the throne, that the pound was worth a pound, that God was in His Heaven, and that all these things would continue for ever and ever… In the longer run, the actions of all the investors, individual and institutional, professional and nonprofessional, have to be based on the belief that leadership knows what it is doing and that rational men are handling the nation’s business rationally. If that belief fades, then so do the markets. They do not merely dive, they dive and then they disappear. It happened here in the blight of the spirit from 1930 to 1933, and it has happened in other countries.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the profit numbers on income statements are treated with such reverence, it was obviously only a question of time before some smart fellows would start building companies not around the logical progression of a business but around what would beef up the numbers. Such a corporation is called a “conglomerate” or a “free-form” company, very popular when the market gets to tulip-time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile — not that it means anything — there are few rich random walkers, and few rich Chartists. But there are some quite successful investors around who have no particular system. Perhaps they are the lucky holders of serial runs, perhaps they are more rational or have better access to information, and perhaps — something not taken into account in the austere statistical worlds — they are better students of psychology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Past patterns help determine future patterns; momentum can be shown on the charts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When there is no skepticism, there is almost no one left to sell to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No matter what role the investor has started with, in a climax on one side or the other the role melts into the crowd role of greed or fear. The only real protection against all the vagaries of identity-playing, and against the final role of being part of the crowd when it stampedes, is to have an identity so firm it is not influenced by all the brouhaha in the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the end object of investment is serenity, and serenity can only be achieved by the avoidance of anxiety, and to avoid anxiety you have to know who you are and what you’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has taken me years to unlearn everything I was taught, and I probably haven’t succeeded yet. I cite this only because most of what has been written about the market tells you the way it ought to be, and the successful investors I know do not hold to the way it ought to be, they simply go with what is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the real test is how you behave when the crowd is roaring the other way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing works all the time and in all kinds of markets… If you really love playing the Game, any action is better than inaction, and sometimes inaction is the proper course, if it has been taken after measuring all the measurable options. If a decision is made not to make a decision, that is just as much a decision as a decision which initiates action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will and Ariel Durant wrote the Lessons of History as a survey of human experience throughout history and the role human nature played in evolving and shaping civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Warning: “Our knowledge of any past event is always incomplete, probably inaccurate, beclouded by ambivalent evidence and biased historians, and perhaps distorted by our own patriotic or religious partisanship. ‘Most history is guessing, and the rest is prejudice.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historians oversimplify, selecting a few facts to tell the story of a chaotic, complex past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acceleration of change combined with chance affects how we apply order to a chaotic past. - The past is fluid because of how we view it through new inventions, discoveries, and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History is an art, not a science. It requires an ability to pull out facts that create meaningful order out of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must operate with partial knowledge, and be provisionally content with probabilities, in history, as in science and politics, relativity rules, and all formula should be suspect. ‘History smiles at all attempts to force its flow into theoretical patterns or logical grooves; it plays havoc with our generalizations, breaks all our rules; history is baroque.’ Perhaps, within these limits, we can learn enough from history to bear reality patiently, and to respect one another’s delusions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However incomplete, the past gives us a chance to understand today and prepare for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human history is a tiny blip on the historical timeline of Earth, the galaxy, and the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The influence of geographical factors diminishes as technology grows.” — Transportation, commerce, and trade (power) were originally controlled by those who controlled the seas. Trains disrupted it some, but the airplane disrupted the old trade routes and created new routes into areas unreachable by sea, shifting the balance of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The laws of biology are the fundamental lessons of history. We are subject to the processes and trials of evolution, to the struggle for existence, and the survival of the fittest to survive. If some of us seem to escape the strife or the trials it is because our group protects us; but that group itself must meet the tests of survival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological Lessons of History:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life is Competition — All species are in competition for survival — peaceful when foods aplenty, warring when food is sparse. They work in groups to improve competitive advantages. “We are acquisitive, greedy, and pugnacious because our blood remembers millenniums through which our forebears had to chase and fight and kill in order to survive, and had to eat to their gastric capacity for fear they should not soon capture another feast. War is a nation’s way of eating.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life is Selection — In the struggle for survival, some are better equipped to succeed, while other’s fail. Nature produces anomalies, specialization, and exceptionalism. Genetic inequalities lead to artificial inequalities. It gives advantage to some groups via invention and discovery, which disadvantages others. So the strong become stronger, and weak become weaker. In other words, inequality rules. — “Nature loves difference as the necessary material of selection and evolution.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life Must Breed — Nature prefers quantity over quality because quantity improves the odds of variation, competition, and selection. When populations are over-abundant, “nature has three agents to restore the balance: famine, pestilence, and war.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“History is color-blind, and can develop a civilization (in any favorable environment) under almost any skin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Nature: “Known history shows little alteration in the conduct of mankind. The Greeks of Plato’s time behaved very much like the French of modern centuries; and the Romans behaved like the English. Means and instrumentalities change; motives and ends remain the same: to act or rest, to acquire or give, to fight or retreat, to seek association or privacy, to mate or reject, to offer or resent parental care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human evolution over the past few thousand years has been social, not biological. People evolved economically, politically, intellectually, and morally through education, innovation, or imitation. Imitators (the majority) following innovators (the minority).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellect is the main driver of change but it can also drive destructive. So resistance to change plays an important role in questioning new ideas — to help weed out the good ideas from the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History reminds us that people have always been human…sin, mistakes, dishonesty, corruption, gambling has always existed. “We have noted the discovery of dice in the excavation near the site of Nineveh; men and women have gambled in every age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must remind ourselves again that history as usually written is quite different from history as usually lived: the historian records the exceptional because it is interesting — because it is exceptional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boring parts of history tend to get lost for being unexceptional but would offer a truer picture of how the overwhelming majority of people lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“History assures us that civilizations decay quite leisurely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early religion was not built on morals but the product of fear of mother nature and natural disasters. Fear was eventually redirected to promote morality and laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson of history is that religions have a life cycle — being born, thriving, and dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History is driven by underlying economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The men who can manage men manage men who can manage only things, and the men who can manage money manage all.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every economic system must have a way for people to gain wealth in exchange for productivity. - Economic systems that tried to use other motives (not wealth) to achieve productivity were too unproductive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Normally and generally men are judged by their ability to produce — except in war, when they are ranked according to their ability to destroy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since inequality rules, there always exists a small portion of the population with a better ability than most to gather wealth. This concentration of wealth is a recurring theme throughout history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The redistribution of wealth is also a recurring theme. The rate of wealth concentration depends on the morals and laws of the time. If the gap between rich and poor becomes too wide, revolution or new laws rebalance the wealth gap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We conclude that the concentration of wealth is natural and inevitable, and is periodically alleviated by violent or peaceable partial redistribution, In this view all economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of concentrating wealth and compulsive recirculation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socialism versus capitalism is part of the cycle of concentration and redistribution of wealth. Finding a balance between public and private has been a long struggle throughout history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitalism has shown its superior ability to put capital and people (talents) to work in the most productive and efficient way possible toward the production of goods and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socialism offers the possibility of equality to the most unequal through government-supported works like education, health, and recreation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competition, unhindered by laws and morals, drives capitalism to extremes. Private monopolies, price manipulation, wage manipulation, and other abuses eventually lead to riot and revolt demanding change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socialism, absent all liberty, leads to its own extremes. Government monopolies, price fixing, wage fixing, high taxation, and a police (military) force to maintain control, eventually lead to corruption, civil unrest, and revolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The fear of capitalism has compelled socialism to widen freedom, and the fear of socialism has compelled capitalism to increase equality.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History shows that power tends to centralize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolute freedom leads to chaos. So the role of government is to establish order without suffocating freedom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The history of governments is overwhelmingly one of monarchy, briefly interrupted by democracy. But monarchy has a poor poor track record thanks to hereditary succession. “When it is hereditary it is likely to be more prolific of stupidity, nepotism, irresponsibility, and extravagance than of nobility and statesmanship.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If the majority of abilities is contained in a minority of men, minority government is as inevitable as the concentration of wealth; the majority can do no more than periodically throw out one minority and set up another.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Violent revolutions do more to destroy wealth than redistribute it and ultimately recreating the very thing it sought to change. The natural tendency of inequality leads to a concentration of possessions, wealth, and power in a minority of hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The only real revolution is in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character, the only real emancipation is individual, and the only real revolutionists are philosophers and saints.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Every advance in the complexity of the economy puts an added premium upon superior ability, and intensifies the concentration of wealth, responsibility, and power.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democracy only succeeds with widespread intelligence. When intelligence is in the minority, democracy fails under widespread ignorance because ignorance is easily manipulated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It may be true as Lincoln supposed, that ‘you can’t fool all the people all the time,’ but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democracy has done more good than any other form of government because, despite prevailing inequality, its role is to provide access to education and opportunity as equally as possible — to give every person the best opportunity to succeed on their own merits and abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;War is a constant of history and the ultimate form of competition in humans. The reasons for war are the same for competition — a desire for more food, land, materials, fuels, power… Making long periods of peace as unnatural as equality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only constant in history is change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“History repeats itself, but only in outline and in the large…because human nature changes with geological leisureliness, and man is equipped to respond in stereotyped ways to frequently occurring situations and stimuli like hunger, danger, and sex. But in a developed and complex civilization individuals are more differentiated and unique than in a primitive society, and many situations contain novel circumstances requiring modifications of instinctive response; custom recedes, reasoning spreads; the results are less predictable. There is no certainty that the future will repeat the past. Every year is an adventure.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civilizations move between growth and decay. Growth depends on the right circumstances to produce highly intelligent, creative, able people equipped to successfully handle change. - Civilizations decline because it fails to produce people capable of handling change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is neutral. It will kill or create, destroy or build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite all the progress in science, technology, and knowledge, people are still the same biological creatures they were thousands of years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Consider education not as the painful accumulation of facts and dates and reigns, nor merely the necessary preparation of the individual to earn his keep in the world, but as the transmission of our mental, moral, technical, and aesthetic heritage as fully as possible to as many as possible, for the enlargement of man’s understanding, control, embellishment, and enjoyment of life.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;B. H. Liddell Hart wrote the book as a summary of the history of warfare. Rather than writing the lessons we learn from history, he inverts the message to the many lessons we fail to learn from history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of history is in the countless repeated ways things can go wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History also teaches that the “tough times” are only temporary. There’s a light at the end of the darkest tunnels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History is only a broad guide — never offers precise details or blueprints — to dealing with current and future events in life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real lessons come from history’s negative value — in learning what to avoid — because it not only records the common mistakes many others made before us but how and why mistakes were made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“‘Fools,’ said Bismarck, ‘say they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by other people’s experience.‘”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning from personal experience should come second to learning from the experience of others since there are thousands of years to draw from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polybius: “There are two roads to the reformation for mankind — one through misfortunes of their own, the other through the misfortunes of others; the former is the most unmistakable, the latter the less painful…the knowledge gained from the study of true history is the best of all educations for practical life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we often mistake as a leader’s moment of brilliance in victory (on the battlefield) is really due to a long-ago development, innovation, or change in practice for the better that is finally executed in battle. Or, in case of the loser, a deterioration in practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s important not to discount the role of mood, morale, and emotional of the people plays in the cause of events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s human nature to paint people, including ourselves, in a better or worse light all time. History is filled with “leaders” willing to fudge their accounts of battle or write orders for false battles to save, maintain, or improve their reputations. They hide their faults. And if the leaders weren’t doing it, the possibility someone else — biased historians or subordinates looking to improve their position — did it for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“A sound rule of historical evidence is that while assertions should be treated with critical doubt, admissions are likely to be reliable. If there is one saying that embodies a general truth it is “No man is condemned save out of his own mouth.” By applying this test we can go a long way toward a clear verdict on history and on history in the making.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loyalty to the truth should be the ultimate goal of the historian and the reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History teaches that there has been a long-running battle with fear of the truth. People mistakenly fail to admit the truth, in so doing help to perpetuate recorded falsehoods. And if it’s not fear, then it’s distortion of the truth to promote a personal or political cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who seek the truth should approach “facts” with skepticism. “Is it true?” should be the first response of those who want to go through life with an open mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The most dangerous of all delusions are those that arise from the adulteration of history in the imagined interests of national and military morale. Although this lesson of experience has been the hardest earned, it remains the hardest to learn. Those who have suffered most show their eagerness to suffer more.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone makes mistakes, but wisest people know it, admit it, and accept it. The greatest failure is failing to recognize our proneness to mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much like the quote “democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others” is that democracy promotes the “triumph of mediocrity,” since its progress toward thought rarely moves faster than its slowest members. Yet, the alternative, despotism, might move faster around progress, typically leads to the “triumph of stupidity.” Weighing the two, mediocrity wins out. Those of us in a democracy, in wanting all its freedoms, must accept that it comes fully equipped with the inefficient pace of progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The psychology that power has on people’s minds has not changed throughout history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Associated with the psychology of power, is the ability to repeatedly ignore our capacity to fool ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of civilization is built on the simple idea of keeping promises, while also not making promises we can’t keep. The result is a lasting trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The cause of most troubles can be traced to excess; the failure to check them to deficiency; their prevention lies in moderation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the cause of most wars is placed on some economic, political, or religious factor, the deeper factors are always rooted in human nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History shows the end of every war sows the seeds of the next war because victories and peace settlements are rarely fair and balanced for both sides. And long and drawn out wars have no winners, only common losers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It is a recurrent illusion in history that the enemy of the time is essentially different, in the sense of being more evil, than any in the past. It is remarkable to see how not only the impression but the phrases repeat themselves. And even historians are apt to lose their balance when they turn from the past to the problems of their own time.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Looking back on the stages by which various fresh ideas gained acceptance, it can be seen that the process was eased when they could be presented not as something radically new but as the revival in modern terms of a time-honored principle or practice that had been forgotten. This required not deception but care to trace the connection — since “there is nothing new under the sun.&quot;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern warfare relies on depleting the will of the people more so than defeating the opposing army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History teaches that we have a long history of propping people up on pedestals out of respect or admiration but risk overinflating their abilities into legends. Over time, facts about the legendary people get overlooked, misplaced, or lost. We know that nobody is perfect, yet we continuously treat the legends as perfection. The older the legend, the older the text, the more we should look at the “facts” skeptically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, the older the text, the more we should treat the lessons within the writing as lessons of life and morality, as opposed to lessons of historical fact. It’s important to remember that the older the text is, the greater the likelihood that emotional bias and embellishment was introduced, first to the orally recorded history, then the written recorded history, and finally to the rewritten recorded history, by humans prone to mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science and technology have advanced more the past hundred years, than the prior millennium, in the improvement of life but when used in war, it’s used as irresponsibly and indifferently as it was in the prior millennium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The germs of war find a focus in the convenient belief that “the end justifies the means.” Each new generation repeats this argument—while succeeding generations have had reason to say that the end their predecessors thus pursued was never justified by the fulfillment conceived. If there is one lesson that should be clear from history it is that bad means deform the end, or deflect its course thither.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History teaches that we put more weight on the effect actions have on history than we do on the effect of thoughts. Yet, our capacity for thought and sharing of ideas is what drives all human progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What can the individual learn from history — as a guide to living? Not what to do but what to strive for. And what to avoid in striving. The importance and intrinsic value of behaving decently. The importance of seeing clearly—not least of seeing himself clearly.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“‘Fools,’ said Bismarck, ‘say they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by other people’s experience.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A sound rule of historical evidence is that while assertions should be treated with critical doubt, admissions are likely to be reliable. If there is one saying that embodies a general truth it is “No man is condemned save out of his own mouth.” By applying this test we can go a long way toward a clear verdict on history and on history in the making.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous of all delusions are those that arise from the adulteration of history in the imagined interests of national and military morale. Although this lesson of experience has been the hardest earned, it remains the hardest to learn. Those who have suffered most show their eagerness to suffer more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The cause of most troubles can be traced to excess; the failure to check them to deficiency; their prevention lies in moderation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a recurrent illusion in history that the enemy of the time is essentially different, in the sense of being more evil, than any in the past. It is remarkable to see how not only the impression but the phrases repeat themselves. And even historians are apt to lose their balance when they turn from the past to the problems of their own time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Looking back on the stages by which various fresh ideas gained acceptance, it can be seen that the process was eased when they could be presented not as something radically new but as the revival in modern terms of a time-honored principle or practice that had been forgotten. This required not deception but care to trace the connection — since “there is nothing new under the sun.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The germs of war find a focus in the convenient belief that “the end justifies the means.” Each new generation repeats this argument—while succeeding generations have had reason to say that the end their predecessors thus pursued was never justified by the fulfillment conceived.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans handle uncertainty poorly. Richard Heuer explains how inherent biases in our thought process work against us, and that knowing about the biases is no help. Still, processes can be built to improve our critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is based on a collection of articles written by Heuer for the CIA to help analysts better understand how they process information involving uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Points (via Jack Davis in the Intro)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human mind is not wired to handle uncertainty well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing biases exist, even being warned about a bias, is little help in avoiding said biases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processes can be created that help offset these biases while working through complex problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans handle complexity terribly. So we developed shortcuts — simple rules of thumb or mental models — to help navigate complex information. The shortcuts work but are within limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortcuts — mental models, etc. — often determine how we interpret and organize information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our education, culture, experience, assumptions, preconceived ideas, etc., impact how we process and interpret information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major paradigm shifts mean that those that know the most about a subject — the experts — have the most to unlearn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Principles of Perception:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;”&lt;strong&gt;We tend to perceive what we expect to perceive&lt;/strong&gt;. A corollary of this principle is that it takes more information, and more unambiguous information, to recognize an unexpected phenomenon than an expected one.”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: A classic experiment showed how expectations influenced perception. Playing cards were altered so that some (not all) spades were red and hearts were black. Pictures of the cards were briefly flashed in front of test subjects. The subjects identified the unaltered cards quickly and accurately, but the unaltered cards gave them trouble. Even after becoming aware that some spades were red and hearts black, their recognition was still slower than with the normal cards. It shows how expectations (of black spades and red hearts) can be so deeply embedded that it influences perception, despite knowing the data was manipulated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, we’re so good at pattern recognition that we have a hard time recognizing when patterns have changed and have a hard time unlearning the patterns once we know it’s changed. Expectations trick our subconscious into seeing what should be there, not what is there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“People have no conceivable way of coping with the volume of stimuli that impinge upon their senses, or with the volume and complexity of the data they have to analyze, without some kind of simplifying preconceptions about what to expect, what is important, and what is related to what.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Mindsets tend to be quick to form but resistant to change.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once we have a pattern in our head, it’s hard to unlearn or replace it with new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“New information is assimilated to existing images.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow or gradual change often goes unnoticed. Experience can be a handicap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“One of the more difficult mental feats is to take a familiar body of data and reorganize it visually or mentally to perceive it from a different perspective.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once we’ve experienced something, like an event, in a particular way, we resist interpreting it differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Initial exposure to blurred or ambiguous stimuli interferes with accurate perception even after more and better information becomes available.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: People were shown pictures of everyday items. The pictures were initially shown out of focus but gradually brought into focus. Those who initially saw the images as the most out of focus had a harder time recognizing the items as the image became clearer than those who initially showed a less out-of-focus image. Longer exposure to a blurred image also required a clearer image to recognize the item. In other words, people form an expectation of what something might be, and confidence in their expectation grows with longer exposure, making changing our minds more difficult when faced with new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“People form impressions based on very little information, but once formed, they do not reject or change them unless they obtain rather solid evidence.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becomes a bigger problem when information is sparse or nonexistent and new information trickles in — form the wrong conclusion early based on sparse info, don’t change your mind as new info rolls in…until it’s too late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One solution is to withhold judgment as long as possible or as long as new information comes in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our accuracy takes the biggest hit when dealing with highly complex, ambiguous situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intelligence seeks to illuminate the unknown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our preconceptions make being objective practically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Ways to Learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By Rote: frequent repetition until it can be repeated from memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By Assimilation: teaching new information by tying it to previously learned information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By Mnemonic Device: a way of organizing information to make it easier to remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to deal with complex problems is to externalize them. Write it out. Break the problem into parts, then work through each while keeping sight of the whole problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our memory is affected by the order we learn something, the amount of time we spend on something, the credibility of the information, and the importance of it when we learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty means always dealing with incomplete knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Analysts Generate and Evaluate Hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situational Logic:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with facts about the current situation, then identify the consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deals with tracing cause-effect or means-ends relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness: 1) It is difficult to figure out how other people might think or behave because we assume they do like us. 2) Fails to consider historical knowledge — how things played out in similar past events — because it only focuses on the current situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situational logic is better for estimating short-term outcomes of events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying Theory:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A theory is formed from many past examples that lead to similar outcomes. It states that given certain conditions, certain results will follow based on a reasonable probability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A theory allows you to quickly separate signals from noise. It helps pick out the important points to a complex problem awash in massive amounts of information. It’s most handy in filtering out unimportant information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness: It often fails to identify time frames in the analysis. It may accidentally filter out important information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It compares the current situation to similar past events to understand possible outcomes. The past events help fill gaps where information is unavailable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often relies on historical analogies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike a theory, it’s used when the comparison sample size is small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A historical event might be so strong that it influences your view of the outcome from the start. Analysis of the current event will forecast a similar fate to the past event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It admits to a lack of current information to understand the present problem and a lack of historical precedent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can lead to misusing historical events by picking what you are most familiar with, by picking the first similar historical event you come across, by lacking historical knowledge, and not researching further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s like dealing with a situation that’s happened once or twice before, and the odds of a similar outcome are far from certain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison is best used to highlight differences, not similarities, in the current problem as it relates to a past event and not conclude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of data/information analysis is to be as objective as possible. It turns out that being objective is almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the scientific method — presenting a theory, then seeking to disprove it — leads to objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less Optimal Decision-Making Strategies (via Alexander George):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satisficing — Settle for the first “good enough” option rather than studying all the options to find the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incrementalism — Look at a narrow range of options that lead to marginal change rather than considering all the options, including those that lead to dramatic change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consensus — Pick the option that gets the most agreement from others or what they want to hear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasoning by Analogy — Pick the option that avoids a past error or repeats a past success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Principles or Maxims — Use a rule of thumb to separate a “good” option from a “bad” option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failures in Decision Making:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selective Perception: We tend to see what we want, not what we need to see. We overlook information that doesn’t fit what we’re looking for, however relevant it is. It’s best to focus on multiple theories at once rather than one when researching information. Not focusing on a single theory means you’re less likely to miss important information that fits other hypotheses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A big hurdle in theory generation is not coming up with a full range of potential outcomes. Most people take a lazy approach. They fail to put the time or effort into generating enough potential outcomes for a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diagnosticity: “Evidence is diagnostic when it influences an analyst’s judgment on the relative likelihood of the various hypotheses. If an item of evidence seems consistent with all the hypotheses, it may have no diagnostic value. It is a common experience to discover that most available evidence is not very helpful, as it can be reconciled with all the hypotheses.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disproving Hypotheses: The goal should be to disprove theories, especially our favourite, rather than confirm them. The problem is that seeking disconfirming evidence doesn’t come naturally. So when we find disconfirming evidence, we discount it, question its credibility, and/or write it off as an anomaly. When dealing with probabilistic outcomes, disproving outcomes is more beneficial than confirming outcomes because, often, relevant information confirms multiple outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is More Information Better?:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key #1: “Once an experienced analyst has the minimum information necessary to make an informed judgment, obtaining additional information generally does not improve the accuracy of his or her estimates. Additional information does, however, lead the analyst to become more confident in the judgment, to the point of overconfidence.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key #2: “Experienced analysts have an imperfect understanding of what information they use in making judgments. They are unaware of how their judgments are determined by a few dominant factors rather than the systematic integration of all available information. Analysts use much less of the available information than they think.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, more information does not improve accuracy. However, in some cases, it does, but also, in some cases, more information — especially contradictory info — decreases confidence in our analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Horse handicappers were shown 88 variables for a past performance chart of horses. The weight carried race finishes (1st, 2nd, 3rd), jockey’s record, and time since a horse’s last race. The handicappers had to identify the five most important variables if they were limited to just five per horse to handicap a race. Then they were asked to do the same thing for 10, 20, and 40 variables if limited to those amounts to handicap races. Each handicapper was given real data based on the five variables he chose and asked to predict each race. They were also asked to rate the confidence in their accuracy from 0 to 100. The same was done for the 10, 20, and 40 variables. The results showed that average accuracy did not change as the information increased, but the handicapper’s confidence in accuracy increased with more information. In other words, more information led to overconfidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Psychologists were given a case of a normal individual divided into four sections. They were asked to judge the case file and answer 25 questions about the person’s personality. The results show that more information did not improve accuracy in the questions but did increase confidence in their answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Doctors were asked how they made medical diagnoses. Doctors that prioritized being thorough with data were less accurate than doctors that approached diagnosis by identifying and testing hypotheses. Adding more data did not improve accuracy. Identifying, testing, and refuting hypotheses was more effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New information that confirms existing variables increases our confidence. In-depth information tends to be more persuasive to authors and readers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New information that introduces new variables is unlikely to improve accuracy in estimates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New information that changes variables critical to estimates has an impact, but it depends on the amount of new information and the confidence in the accuracy of the new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New information that shifts the importance of a variable affects confidence and estimates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More data backing up a conclusion leads to overconfidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to make better decisions requires constant feedback. Assess past decisions by linking accuracy in a decision with variables used to come to a decision. This works when the outcomes can be easily tied to specific variables, like in blackjack. This can be difficult to impossible in complex systems with hundreds or thousands of variables involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most analysis fails because we confuse signal for noise. Relevant information is discounted, misinterpreted, or ignored because of biases. Our biases limit how we view information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Stay Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitivity Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; — Question assumptions. Try to disprove them. Ask what would make your assumptions out of date. Has it already happened? What would make you change your mind? If you fail to come up with an answer, your mind isn’t open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify Alternatives&lt;/strong&gt; — Seek out people who disagree with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Mirror-Images&lt;/strong&gt; — Don’t assume that others will think or behave in the same way as you. Avoid the “If I were so and so, they would do X, Y, and Z.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek Out Different Perspectives&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking Backwards&lt;/strong&gt; — Start with the end in mind and work backward. Pick an alternative outcome and assume it happened. Then look back and explain how it happened. It changes the question from “what might happen” to “how it might happen.” Works great for low-probability, high-impact events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crystal Ball&lt;/strong&gt; — Assume you have a crystal ball that can predict the future, only it predicts that your assumption is wrong. Explain how the crystal ball is right. It forces you to try a disprove your assumption or poke holes in it, at least.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role-Playing&lt;/strong&gt; — Take on the role of another person and act out that person’s actions. It requires a group environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devil’s Advocate&lt;/strong&gt; — Bring someone to argue on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know When to Change Your Mind:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn from Surprises&lt;/strong&gt; — Keep track of unexpected events rather than discount or ignore it and try to explain them. A pattern of surprises might indicate that your thinking needs to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Assumptions vs. Tactical Indicators&lt;/strong&gt; — When indicators (like data points) disagree with assumptions, try giving more weight to indicators than the assumptions. Maybe don’t use said indicator to sway a decision but rather to stay more alert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boost Creative Thinking:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defer Judgment — The most important. Hold off judgment until all ideas are written down. Judgment sours creativity. Separate idea generation from the evaluation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantity Leads to Quality —  The first ideas are the most typical, obvious, and common ones. Coming up with as many ideas as possible inevitably produces a few quality ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Constraints — Make it as free-thinking as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross Fertilization — Combine ideas to form new ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are best done in groups — brainstorming sessions — within an organizational environment that supports the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decomposition — divides a problem into separate parts, i.e. divide and conquer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Externalization — gets the problem out of your head and onto paper. It’s most beneficial with complex problems because the many variables become too hard to track without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists, outlines, tables, diagrams, flow charts, and matrices work in a similar way to Franklin’s pro/con list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of Competing Hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify all the possible hypotheses. A group works best. Don’t overlook unproven hypotheses. Greater uncertainty in the outcome should lead to more hypotheses, not less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List the evidence/arguments for and against each one. Think about what evidence is missing too. Ask if a specific hypothesis is true and what evidence should exist. What evidence should not exist? What evidence should show up eventually?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a matrix — hypotheses across the top, evidence down the side — to see which evidence overlaps into multiple hypotheses compared to evidence that is unique and helpful to one hypothesis (diagnosticity). Ask if the evidence is consistent, inconsistent, or irrelevant. Add a probability scale to the evidence-based on its importance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refine the matrix by reconsidering hypotheses and deleting evidence with no unique value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw tentative conclusions and try to disprove the hypotheses. Accept only hypotheses that can not be rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the sensitivity of conclusions. Ask what the consequences are if the evidence is wrong or incorrect. Are there alternative explanations? Is fraud or deception a possible alternative?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report conclusions, including the probability of all the hypotheses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify future points to reassess events. Be specific about what to watch for or what would change your mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of competing hypotheses won’t guarantee correct answers. Uncertainty means there’s always a chance of being wrong. It’s about having a rational process that should increase the odds of being right. It also makes it easier to audit the process and make improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive biases&lt;/strong&gt; are subconscious mental errors caused by over-simplified rules of thumb that usually help us make quicker decisions. Under certain circumstances, those rules of thumb produce faulty decisions. Being aware of the bias won’t change the poor decision either. So biases are difficult to overcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information we experience directly&lt;/strong&gt; — we see, hear, etc. — has a greater impact than more informative information received secondhand. Things we experience personally are more memorable than the events we read about. Stories and anecdotes have a bigger impact than numbers. Statistical data lacks the vivid detail to elicit a memorable image, so it’s often overlooked. Even popular sayings back this up. “Seeing is believing.” or “Don’t believe everything you read.” It biases how we view information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Error&lt;/strong&gt;: The Sample Size of One — We let the experience of a single outcome outweigh the statistical probability of an outcome over larger sample size. One bad shopping experience, one bad meal at a restaurant, and one bad story about a particular car change our thinking about that store, restaurant, or car model. Testimonials from close family or friends or the “Man-Who” Syndrome (“I know a man who…”) work in a similar way. Despite the statistical evidence, a single outlier experience outweighs the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s difficult to recognize important missing or incomplete information and factor it into our analysis. The solution is to identify important variables in advance and use it to track missing information. The lack of specific information may support or refute certain outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oversensitive to Consistency&lt;/strong&gt; — a consistent pattern is usually helpful but could be deceptive in certain situations, like if the information is highly correlated to something else that’s not known yet or drawn from a small sample size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to accept or reject information completely without weighing our confidence in the accuracy of the information or its source. Rather than saying we’re 60% or 70% certain about a piece of information, we treat it as 100% certain or 0% certain, which can lead to over or under-confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False impressions persist after they’ve been discredited. For example, test subjects were misled about their success or failure at performing a task and continued to believe in their ability or lack of ability even after they were told the truth. A similar phenomenon was found in observers of experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Scientist Versus the Historian&lt;/strong&gt;: a scientist starts with a theory and sets out to disprove it with data, accepting it when it can’t be rejected. A historian creates a story out of a few pieces of data. A historian may overlook data to make the story coherent. That coherence can lead to biases. It implies order, patterns, or relationships that may not exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We often seek out causes for random events because we prefer order. For example, during WWII, people tried to explain the pattern of the German bombing of London. They used those explanations to decide where to live and which shelters to use. After the war, the bombings were shown to be randomly distributed. People focused on the bomb hits that fit their explanation and ignored the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We underestimate how small causes can lead to large effects. Accidents, unintended consequences, and coincidences get downplayed for more lofty or conspiratorial explanations. It’s another attempt to bring order to chance or randomness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fallacy of Identity&lt;/strong&gt; — we assume that the cause must resemble its effect. We use a rule of thumb that compares similar attributes between cause and effect to make judgments. We “tend to assume that economic events have primarily economic causes, that big events have important consequences, and that little event cannot affect the course of history. Such correspondence between cause and effect makes a more logical and persuasive–a more coherent–narrative, but there is little basis for expecting such inferences to correspond to historical fact.” It leads to conspiracy theories. We try to explain a big event with a similarly big cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal causes of behaviour are personality, attitude, and beliefs. External causes are incentives, peer or social pressure, and situation-specific role requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We put more weight on the internal causes of behaviour and less on external causes. It’s also dependent on whether it’s someone else’s behaviour or our own. External factors influence our behaviour, but others’ behaviour is internal. We tend to explain our behaviour as being influenced by specific situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We overestimate how much we influence the behaviour of others. We overlook unintended consequences and assume our actions had the desired effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also believe that our actions caused our successes but not failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also overestimate our importance in other people’s actions. Again, we overlook unintended consequences and assume that actions that hurt us were intended to hurt, not an unfortunate side effect of a decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illusory Correlation&lt;/strong&gt; — “Correlation alone does not necessarily imply causation. For example, two events might co-occur because they have a common cause rather than one causes the other. But when two events or changes co-occur, and the time sequence is such that one always follows the other, people often infer that the first caused the second. Thus, inaccurate perception of correlation leads to inaccurate perception of cause and effect.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to focus on things that support the existence of a relationship but ignore the things that don’t support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re bad at estimating and calculating probabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability Rule&lt;/strong&gt; — a rule of thumb used to estimate probability based on easily they can recall or how familiar they are with similar events. Generally, if something occurs often, it’s easier to remember and likely to continue occurring often. Unless our ability to remember or imagine something has nothing to do with its probability of happening. Problems arise because we tend to remember certain events better — recent events, events we were personally involved in, important events, etc. — and it affects our judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The act of constructing a detailed scenario for a possible future event makes that event more readily imaginable and, therefore, increases its perceived probability.” It can lead to taking unlikely scenarios too seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchoring&lt;/strong&gt; — when we use a starting point, like a past estimate, to make a new estimate, but rather than adjust the starting point based on new information, it acts as an anchor preventing adjustment. So estimates that start too low (too high) end up too low (too high).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awareness of an anchoring bias won’t fix the problem. The best way to avoid the problem is to not use any prior estimates as a starting point. Start from scratch. Using Bayesian statistics might be another option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We overuse subjective probabilities and underuse statistical probabilities. In other words, we rely on arbitrary words — possible, probable, likely, unlikely, could, etc. — that are subjective rather than actual numbers. Ask a bunch of people to put “probable” into percentage terms, and you’ll get a wide range of answers. Use percentages or odds in place or brackets after ambiguous words to avoid confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time frames like “at this time” or “in the short term” can be similarly too subjective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re bad at assessing the probability of a series of events — where each event has its probability — when estimating the outcome. The proper way is to multiply the probability of each event to get the final estimated probability. So the chance of getting three heads in a row while tossing a coin is .5 x .5  x .5 or .125 or 12.5%. Also, the event with the lowest probability sets the upper limit of the probability for the entire series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base Rate Fallacy&lt;/strong&gt; — base rates highlight the probability of a thing occurring based on a large sample size of data. The fallacy ignores the data unless it fits with data specific to the situation at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Planning Fallacy&lt;/strong&gt; — we overestimate our ability to finish a plan or project in a set amount of time despite experience suggesting otherwise. It’s a perfect example of the base rate fallacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hindsight Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we overestimate our accuracy, after the fact, in predicting an outcome before it happens. We also underestimate how much we learn from things we read, watch, etc. And when looking back at past outcomes, we view it as being obvious or foreseeable when, in fact, it wasn’t at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Test subjects were asked to estimate the probability of several events occurring during President Nixon’s trip to Peking and Moscow in 1972. Afterward, they were asked at varying periods to repeat their previous estimates of each event and whether the event occurred or not during the President’s trip. The hindsight bias was evident just three to six months after the trip. 84% claimed higher estimates than their original estimate for events that did occur and lower estimates for events that did not occur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We overestimate how much we previously expected an event to occur and underestimate how much we previously expected events that eventually did not occur. At some point after an event, knowing the outcome changes our memory of how much we previously expected said outcome. Our memory fades as time elapses, increasing the bias’s effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We underestimate the impact of new information. It’s the “I knew it all along…” bias.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Test subjects were asked 75 questions based on facts from almanacs and encyclopedias and assigned a confidence percentage to each answer. Afterward, the subjects were divided into three groups. The first group was given 25 previous questions and asked to repeat their prior answers. The second group was given the same 25 questions, with the correct answers circled, and asked to repeat their prior answers. The third group was given 25 new questions, just as difficult as the previous ones, with the correct answers marked and asked to give their answers as if they didn’t know the correct answer. The third group showed the most significant results. The number of correct answers far exceeded what they should have gotten correct had they not been given the correct answers in advance. They exaggerated knowing the answers and their confidence in knowing it. Said another way, they underestimated what they learned and how much it helped them answer correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to think that once an event happens that it is more easily foreseeable than it was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Experiment: Test subjects were divided into five groups. Each group received a summary of an event — between the British and Gurkhas in 1814 — with four possible outcomes. One group received the summary with all four possible outcomes. The other four groups received the summary and the four possible outcomes but added a new sentence highlighting one outcome. So four groups, four sentences highlighting a different outcome. The groups were asked to estimate the probability of each outcome. The results showed that groups given a highlighted outcome gave a higher probability (almost double) of those outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One possible solution to hindsight bias is to ask: Would I be surprised if the opposite occurred? Would it be predictable if the opposite occurred?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define the Problem&lt;/strong&gt; — make sure you’re asking the right questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt; — as many as possible and hold off judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collect Information&lt;/strong&gt; — collect information related to all hypotheses, not just the most likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt; — disprove hypotheses rather than confirm them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select the Most Likely Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt; — cite arguments for and against it, including the odds of it happening and your confidence in the conclusion, and do the same for the rejected hypotheses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor for New Information&lt;/strong&gt; — Be specific about what to look for in advance. Watch for surprises. Situations change in a complex world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A fundamental question posed in any postmortem investigation of intelligence failure is this: Given the information that was available at the time, should analysts have been able to foresee what was going to happen? Unbiased evaluation of intelligence performance depends upon the ability to provide an unbiased answer to this question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowing the outcome of a situation makes it harder to imagine other outcomes that might have been considered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When base rates are not well known but must be inferred or researched, they are even less likely to be used.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When analysts make quick, gut judgments without really analyzing the situation, they are likely to be influenced by the availability bias. The more a prospective scenario accords with one’s experience, the easier it is to imagine and the more likely it seems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“History is, by and large, a record of what people did, not what they failed to do.” — E.H. Carr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When observing another’s behavior, people are too inclined to infer that the behavior was caused by broad personal qualities or dispositions of the other person and to expect that these same inherent qualities will determine the actor’s behavior under other circumstances. Not enough weight is assigned to external circumstances that may have influenced the other person’s choice of behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a general rule, biased attribution of causality helps sow the seeds of mistrust and misunderstanding between people and between governments. We tend to have quite different perceptions of the causes of each other’s behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People generally do not accept the notion of chance or randomness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People expect patterned events to look patterned, and random events to look random, but this is not the case. Random events often look patterned… However, events will almost never be perceived intuitively as being random; one can find an apparent pattern in almost any set of data or create a coherent narrative from any set of events.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because of a need to impose order on our environment, we seek and often believe we find causes for what are actually accidental or random phenomena… People also tend to assume that causes are similar to their effects, in the sense that important or large effects must have large causes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People do not have much intuitive feel for how large a sample has to be before they can draw valid conclusions from it. The so-called law of small numbers means that, intuitively, we make the mistake of treating small samples as though they were large ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We seldom take the absence of evidence into account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Information that is vivid, concrete, and personal has a greater impact on our thinking than pallid, abstract information that may actually have substantially greater value as evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most probable hypothesis is usually the one with the least evidence against it, not the one with the most evidence for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doubt is not a pleasant state, but certainty is a ridiculous one.” — Voltaire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To get over this, my way is to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns; writing over the one Pro, and over the other Con. Then, during three or four days of consideration, I put down under the different heads short hints of the different motives, that at different times occur to me, for or against the measure. When I have thus got them all together in one view, I endeavor to estimate their respective weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out. If I find a reason pro equal to some two reasons con, I strike out the three…and thus proceeding I find at length where the balance lies; and if, after a day or two of further consideration, nothing new that is of importance occurs on either side, I come to a determination accordingly. And, though the weight of reasons cannot be taken with the precision of algebraic quantities, yet when each is thus considered, separately and comparatively, and the whole lies before me, I think I can judge better, and am less liable to make a rash step, and in fact I have found great advantage from this kind of equation.” — Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minds are like parachutes. They only function when they are open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A new idea is the beginning, not the end, of the creative process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New ideas result from the association of old elements in new combinations. Previously remote elements of thought suddenly become associated in a new and useful combination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Information that is consistent with an existing mind-set is perceived and processed easily and reinforces existing beliefs. Because the mind strives instinctively for consistency, information that is inconsistent with an existing mental image tends to be overlooked, perceived in a distorted manner, or rationalized to fit existing assumptions and beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Experts overestimate the importance of factors that have only a minor impact on their judgment and underestimate the extent to which their decisions are based on a few major variables. In short, people’s mental models are simpler than they think, and the analyst is typically unaware not only of which variables should have the greatest influence, but also which variables actually are having the greatest influence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When resorting to an analogy, they tend to seize upon the first that comes to mind. They do not research more widely. Nor do they pause to analyze the case, test its fitness, or even ask in what ways it might be misleading.” — Earnest May&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If information does not fit into what people know, or think they know, they have great difficulty processing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is much easier after the fact to sort the relevant from the irrelevant signals. After the event, of course, a signal is always crystal clear. We can now see what disaster it was signaling since the disaster has occurred, but before the event it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings.” — Roberta Wohlstetter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One strategy too often used by intelligence analysts is described as “satisficing”– choosing the first hypothesis that appears good enough rather than carefully identifying all possible hypotheses and determining which is most consistent with the evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…historical analogies often precede, rather than follow, a careful analysis of a situation.” — Robert Jarvis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tendency to relate contemporary events to earlier events as a guide to understanding is a powerful one. Comparison helps achieve understanding by reducing the unfamiliar to the familiar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question is not whether one’s prior assumptions and expectations influence analysis, but only whether this influence is made explicit or remains implicit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Objectivity is gained by making assumptions explicit so that they may be examined and challenged, not by vain efforts to eliminate them from analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simultaneous evaluation of multiple, competing hypotheses permits a more systematic and objective analysis than is possible when an analyst focuses on a single, most-likely explanation or estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray and Vogel introduce the theory behind momentum, what drives the effect, why it should persist, and how to build an improved quantitative momentum strategy that exploits the sustainable edge in investor misbehavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A momentum strategy is simply: buying winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value and momentum strategies are tied to expectation error (from a behavioral viewpoint). Momentum strategies work because of underreaction to positive news, value strategies because of overreaction to negative news. That’s where the similarities end. Value’s focus is on fundamentals to assess price versus intrinsic value. Momentum’s focus is on price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any “anomaly” strategy will continue to work as long as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors, on average, exhibit behavioral biases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors remain short-term performance chasers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, build strategies around areas where investor misbehavior and fund manager incentives (like career risk) or frictions endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-Series Momentum: Or absolute momentum, is based on a stock’s past return, independent of other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-Sectional Momentum: is based on a stock’s past return, relative to other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Behavioral bias + Market frictions = Mispriced assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral-based strategy framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify areas mispricing due to behavior driving prices from fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify incentives and frictions where fund managers are unable or unwilling to act due to high arbitrage costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify areas were high mispricings and high arbitrage costs overlap (where arbitrage costs are high for the majority of managed capital, but low for the individual investor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a good process to exploit it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of high arbitrage costs can be found in career risk: relative underperformance increases career risk. Think of a fund manager who’s decisions are aligned with keeping their job (or avoid losing clients) instead of finding mispriced opportunities because mispriced opportunities bring a higher risk of deviating from the market return in the short term. The higher cost of job loss in the short term outweighs the importance of higher long term returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The next time you hear a market participant suggest that one strategy is better than another strategy, simply ask two basic questions: (1) Why are the securities selected by this process mispriced? and (2) Why aren’t other smart investors already exploiting the mispricing opportunity? Without solid answers to both questions, it is unlikely that the investment process is sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum Basics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research shows that stocks that performed well over the past year, continue to do so in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists when controlled for size and value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works across asset classes, countries, commodities, currencies, and bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robust across time (one study found the effect going back 200 years).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncorrelated with value, offering a diversification benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We use the term momentum to mean a continuation of past relative returns — past winners tend to be future winners, while past losers tend to be future losers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disposition effect — the tendency to sell assets that rose in value (while holding assets that fell in value)  — might explain momentum. In effect, investors lock in gains too soon. They fail to let their winners run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps momentum investing’s edge could be characterized as pessimism in the presence of strong short-term fundamentals, which causes stocks to remain too cheap to future expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum is not the same as growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing monthly randomly drawn top “growth” versus “momentum” stocks, momentum outperformed growth on average over a 50 year period, with significantly lower drawdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum stocks can be growth stocks, value stocks, quality, low-vol… Unlike value, growth, quality, etc., fundamentals don’t factor into momentum stocks at all. High momentum is based on price action alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Momentum investing works because the relative strength indicator is a proxy for a systematic expectation error in the market that predictably reverts in the momentum investor’s favor, on average.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum (high Mom) beats value (high B/M), growth (low B//M), and the broad market based on Ken French data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value and momentum are driven by opposites sides of a similarly biased coin. Value by overreaction — investors are too quick to update views based on new data. Momentum by underreaction — investors are too slow to update views based on new data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum, like any solid strategy, requires discipline because it fails to work all the time. Multi-year periods of market underperformance are likely. The seven-year period of underperformance from 2008 to 2014, is a recent example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Momentum-based stock selection strategies won’t provide extreme insurance-like diversification benefits, but momentum strategies can pack a punch as it relates to overall diversification. For example, long-only momentum strategies are not perfectly correlated to the broad equity market, and they have low correlations with classic value strategies. These features make momentum strategies highly desirable in a portfolio context when they are pooled with value strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to calculate “momentum”? Momentum for a stock is the stock’s total return w/ dividends over a specific period, like the past 12 months. (A generic momentum strategy is built: sort stocks by highest “momentum,” then seed portfolio with the top 30, 50, 100, etc. stocks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-term Momentum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses, at most, a 1-month look-back period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studies show last week’s winners are this week’s losers and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, last month’s winners are this month’s losers and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio rebalanced monthly showed the prior month’s losers beat the winners by a 9% annual return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, prior short term winners become losers and losers become winners in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate Momentum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses a 6 to 12-month look-back period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studies show that winners stay winners and losers stay losers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the effect dissipates after a short while before ultimately reverses (see long term momentum). In other words, using intermediate-term momentum but then held long term results in worse performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio rebalanced monthly showed intermediate-term winners beat losers by an almost 18% annual return (also beat the market).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“…portfolios formed on intermediate-term momentum exhibit a continuation of returns… However, as we discussed earlier, this “continuation” effect does not work if we just buy-and-hold intermediate-term momentum stocks. We must form the portfolio so that the rebalance frequency can capture the abnormal returns associated with the approach.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term Momentum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses a 3 to 5 year (60-months) look-back period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studies show over 3 and 5 year periods, the winners became the losers, and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio rebalanced monthly, based on previous 5-year performance, showed prior long-term losers beat the winners by a roughly 5% annual return (also beat the market).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a general rule, and putting transaction costs aside, the more frequent a portfolio is rebalanced, the better the performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intermediate momentum portfolio examples use a 12-month look-back period but only use the first 11 months for the momentum calculation. The last month is ignored to account for the short-term momentum reversal effect. However, the authors’ state, including the last month does not significantly alter results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varying the holder period and portfolio concentration: returns improve with a shorter holding period and a higher concentration of stocks (shortest holding period tested was 1-month with a concentration of 50 stocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible improvements to a simple momentum strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Smooth” versus “Choppy” Momentum: compare the percentage of days with a positive return relative to days with a negative return. “Smooth” momentum stocks have a higher percentage of positive return days and tend to perform better than “Choppy” momentum stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Boring” versus “Lottery” Momentum: compare average daily return in the past month. “Boring” momentum stocks have a lower average daily return over the past month and tend to outperform “Lottery” momentum stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A proxy for “Boring” versus “Lottery” is low beta versus high beta, where low beta = boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“…momentum profits are larger for stocks with low analyst coverage and for small stocks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human beings suffer from an inability to properly weigh their chances of success for low-probability events. In other words, humans predictably overestimate their chances of winning the lottery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On seasonality effects: “One needs to be skeptical of seasonality-type claims.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the authors argue for a momentum strategy (by rebalancing before quarter-ending month) built around the effects of quarterly window dressing and year-end tax-loss selling. The backtested returns weren’t significantly different enough from a generic mom strategy to be convincing (a 0.48% difference in returns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Window Dressing: the act of fund managers to fill their funds with “winning” stocks before the end of a quarter when holdings are reported. The idea being, dressing up their portfolio with “winners” (while selling “losers”) helps retain clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax Loss Selling: the theory is that year-end tax-loss selling leads to a new year buying spree or the “January Effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equal weighting a generic momentum strategy boosted returns by 2.4%, benefiting from diversification and small-cap effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must emphatically emphasize that investors need to be prepared for the enhanced volatility and drawdown risks associated with momentum strategies — that is a primary reason why this system is expected to work in the future — but this enhanced risk is more than offset by additional expected returns, which is what makes momentum anomalous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing Backtested Maximum Drawdowns: helps answer the question of how much can I lose? Using rolling drawdowns (5-year, 10-year) helps compare the frequency of big drawdowns between multiple strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the pinnacle point of pain, when the most disciplined and hardened active investors earn their keep, the active investor with a clear mind, thorough understanding, and a strong conviction for their process will win. Those who do not fully understand why a process works are more likely to provide the active alpha to the clairvoyant investor who can hold on to an active portfolio like grim death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolio Construction Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A combo portfolio split 50/50 between a concentrated value strategy and momentum strategy (rebalanced quarterly) improved performance while reducing the longer periods of underperformance achieved in a value or momentum strategy alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a trend strategy to the combo value/momentum portfolio reduces large drawdowns significantly, but comes with a cost of a slightly lower return. (Used a simple moving average rule: S&amp;#x26;P 500 Total Return Index – S&amp;#x26;P 500 12-month moving average &gt; 0, go long the combo, otherwise, go long T-bills.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core-Satellite Approach: the “core” portfolio is a passive strategy, with a small percentage — the “satellite” — dedicated to an active strategy, like an 80/20 allocation to core/satellite. It gets a slight improvement over market returns at a minimal cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If one is going to deviate from a passive index, and pay extra management fees, embrace active risk and pay up for concentration, not closet-indexing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep value investing takes advantage of mean reversion: that prices eventually move back toward normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To beat the market, you can’t invest with the crowd. You must invest differently than the crowd and be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep value stocks have a built-in margin of safety. The stocks are undervalued because the possibility of a worst-case scenario is already priced in. That gives it a high upside/low downside bet. The worst-case scenario provides a low downside, so you can’t lose much if you’re wrong. But if you’re right, the high upside brings exceptional returns. So even if you’re right as often as you’re wrong, you do okay. Be more right than wrong, you do great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why buy an undervalued failing business? Because of 3 opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its assets have value. The crowd might be selling because of the poor business while ignoring the assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The horrible news surrounding the business turns out to be less bad. With the worst-case scenario off the table, the stock price adjusts higher. (Also, the crowd can overreact by discounting the worst-case scenario. So realizing the worst-case scenario leads to a good return.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activists and private equity seek out poorly managed businesses to be bought out/turned around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition is behind mean reversion. High profits attract competitors, competition eats into the profits and growth, losses cause competitors to fold, which allows for high profits for survivors. It’s a relentless cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The byproduct of mean reversion is undervalued stocks beat the market, expensive stocks fall short. High-growth businesses slow down. High-profit businesses see profits fall. Declining companies turn around. Unprofitable businesses become profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few businesses have sustainably high profits (moats), but finding them are difficult:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses with moats are rare — rarer than the crowd expects. Confusing peak business cycle for a moat is a common mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moats don’t guarantee high profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moats don’t last forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett was closer to a deep value investor during his early partnership days, before transitioning to a “wonderful companies at fair prices” investor. See’s Candies, with its high return on capital, was the catalyst. Dollars reinvested into a business with a high sustainable growth rate, compounds the value of the business over time. A rare company like See’s has a moat that fends off mean reversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of following Buffett is being a poor judge of moats. It’s difficult to tell the difference between an average business at the top of its cycle from a wonderful business…until mean reversion kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acquirer’s Multiple attempts to avoid that risk by buying “fair companies at wonderful prices” (unlike Joel Greenblatt’s Magic Formula, which attempts to replicate Buffett’s “wonderful companies at a fair price” strategy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acquirer’s Multiple compares the total cost of a business (if you were to buy it outright) to its operating income or enterprise value divided by operating earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise Value = market cap plus debt plus preferred stock plus minority interest minus cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Earnings = revenue minus the cost of goods sold minus administrative costs minus depreciation/amortization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A negative EV, in theory, is a good thing — low/no debt with lots of cash. But it’s likely a sign of a bad business that burns through cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using OE makes for easier apples-to-apples comparisons across companies. It takes a top-down approach to the income statement, by including interest and taxes and excluding any one-off special items (non-recurring income) that can inflate/deflate reported earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backtesting shows The Acquirer’s Multiple beats the Magic Formula and the S&amp;#x26;P500 in from 1972 to 2017. It crushed an opposing strategy that buys a basket of stocks with the highest profits (the high profits strategy actually beat the S&amp;#x26;P 500 too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin of Safety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows room for investor error. The deeper the discount to fair value, the bigger the margin of safety, the more room for error, the better the potential return, and the lower the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ex: margin of safety on balance sheet — low debt in relation to cash or size of the business. Excessive debt may lead to financial distress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ex: margin of safety in business — real business with a history of real earnings and cash flows, with no signs of fraud or earnings manipulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Bondt and Thaler (1987) study tested mean reversion on profits. Profit growth on undervalued stocks rose higher than expansive stocks (profit growth actually slowed on expensive stocks). And undervalued stocks beat the market by 41% over 4 years, while the market beat expensive stocks by 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Value Investing Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undervalued stocks beat expensive stocks and the market because stock prices mean revert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROE and earnings growth rates mean revert too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrated Portfolio Trade-off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher Volatility — more volatile than the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher Tracking Error — less likely to track the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple rules beat the experts and the amateurs. Investors who follow a strict set of rules may override the rules to their own detriment. They tend to find a lot of “broken legs” — reasons to avoid a stock the rules would otherwise include — in irrelevant data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mean reversion is the expected outcome. But we don’t expect mean reversion. Instead, our instinct is to find a trend and extrapolate it. We think it will always be winter for some stocks and summer for others. Instead, fall follows summer, and spring follows winter. Eventually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Profit margins are probably the most mean-reverting series in finance, and if profit margins do not mean-revert, then something has gone badly wrong with capitalism. If high profits do not attract competition, there is something wrong with the system and it is not functioning properly.” — Jeremy Grantham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most surprising result of Buffett’s theory of value. Not all growth is good. Only businesses earning profits better than the rate required by the market should grow. Businesses with profits below that rate turn dollars in earnings into cents on the dollar in business value. The owner of the good business wants the business to reinvest and grow because that growth is profitable. The owner of the bad business wants all the earnings paid out because the growth destroys value. Alas, good business can’t absorb much extra capital without profits going down. And bad businesses need all earnings reinvested just to keep up with inflation. For a business to be worth more than its invested capital, it must maintain a profit greater than the market requires.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to maximizing returns is to maximize our chance at mean reversion. That means maximizing the margin of safety. We want the most undervalued stocks. And we want to make sure they survive to mean revert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists focus on excess cash because too much can hurt a company’s value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABCs of Property Management by Ken McElroy is part of the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series of books. Like most Rich Dad, Poor Dad books this is heavy in anecdotes and inspiration, but light on practical how-tos or step by step instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the book is an inspirational sales pitch for the property management industry. Towards the end book, McElroy gives practical advice on how to pick the right property manager. If you are already a property manager, this book references many best practices, but does little to tell you how to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good management practices can and should be applied to properties of any size: from a single family home to large multi-unit towers and apartment complexes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this chapter there is a story about a 200 unit building the author’s company took over. Inside this story there are helpful reminders and anecdotes about the things a property manager should be aware of.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you charging premiums for units on higher floors? With more rooms/square footage?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are your vacant units actually ready to rent?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are maintenance service requests being handled in a timely manner? Long overdue requests increase turnovers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staff: If you are unable to meet your needs, is it a case of being understaffed or a case of staffing the wrong people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even small properties, like single family homes can have major challenges. These challenges do not usually take the form of a single major catastrophe, but instead a series of small mistakes that add up and greatly reduce value (i.e. charging under market rent, deferring maintenance, not signing leases or using improper forms, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most amateur investors rationalize away these mistakes and chalk them up to the property being a “bad investment” when in fact, it was bad management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without management systems in place, you may get lucky for your first few tenants, or even many years of operation. Eventually, however, unsound management practices will catch up to you and result in tens of thousands of dollars in lost rent or damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beyond just the financial impact, poor management can have deep emotional costs: expensive repairs, evicting tenants, or just dealing with late rent is stressful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing rentals long distance is incredibly challenging. The key to success is having a solid team. Consider the following roles for your team:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local broker – someone who understands the market and provide you unique insights and data.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local property manager – someone who understands the changing market and can change with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attorney – to draft and review legal documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due diligence team – people to inspect the entire property and find things that you would otherwise miss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every major city has tons of sub-markets. When managing remotely, it is tempting to use one-size fits all techniques because other rentals in the city use similar techniques. That may cause you to miss out on trends within your rentals’ specific neighborhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With larger properties, the opportunity for losses from small mistakes are greatly amplified. For example, undercharging only $45/month on 100 units translates to $54,000 in lost income per year. At a 4% cap rate, that is $1.35M in value lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with residents is an investors biggest fear. This fear is what drives investors to not make the tough decisions, like not giving the tenant an extra week to pay the rent, not raising the rent, not charging for damages on move-out. Don’t let fear ruin your investment. If you fear this is you, consider hiring a property manager. If you don’t believe you could evict a family, do not manage a property. Hire someone to do that for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When dealing with tenants, you will need to (among other things): find them, collect rent/fees, be a sounding board for them, address their maintenance issues, enforce policies and contracts, deal with intra-resident relationships (in mutli-family).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;maintenance&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#maintenance&quot; aria-label=&quot;maintenance permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintenance is the single most time-consuming and expensive part of owning an investment property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance is also the reason residents move out&lt;/strong&gt;. If they are not happy with your service, they will move down the street, even if it means paying more in rent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One bad maintenance experience is enough to motivate your tenants to shop around for alternative places to live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paying to advertise and re-fill a vacant unit is much more expensive than hiring a handyman to make a simple repair quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relying on a tenant to “take care” of your investment will result in costly deferred maintenance. Hire professionals and keep it in your control. Also, save your receipts–you can deduct the maintenance costs from your taxes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deferred maintenance hurts you in three ways:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rents are reduced because the rental is providing low value to tenants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turnovers are increased, which increases expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sale price is reduced, more so than just the cost of the maintenance. Buyers must also account for lost time and the additional lost rents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Property management companies can achieve economies of scale: they can negotiate lower rates with technicians and have their problems serviced with higher priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your property’s success depends greatly on how well you understand this simple truth: When fixing their homes, tenants expect you to be accommodating to their schedules, not to yours. In fact, they are paying you for this service. In property management, your tenant’s schedule will be your schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple truth: if it takes you 2 weeks to fill a vacant unit, you have lost 2 weeks of potential income. Reduce your turnover time and you will make more money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a standard inspection form for move-in and move-out. Have the tenant sign it and keep it for your records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photographic documentation is best. Not only will it protect you legally, but it will reduce tenant disputes in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At move out, you must do two things: determine how much to deduct from the security deposit and line up the work required on the unit to make it move-in-ready again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people try to save money by doing turnover work themselves. This is pennywise and pound-foolish. On a $1500 unit, every day the unit sits vacant is $50 in lost income. Moreover, the opportunity cost of you directing your labor towards the turnover is higher than that: could you be spending your time in other ways to be increasing your recurring income instead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always perform a background check on your tenants. This should be common sense and should not require explanation. If you disagree, I strongly question your judgment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use standard application forms and charge an application fee to cover all of your expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with professional attorneys to help cover you. Rental laws are complex. You should seek legal help. Why spend hundreds of thousands on an investment property and then choose to save a few hundred bucks by not hiring a lawyer? That savings can cost you tens of thousands later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put simply: in many localities it is incredibly difficult to evict a tenant unless you have proper documentation from the very beginning of the lease. Use a lawyer to get you on the right track so that if you have to evict someone, you don’t find yourself in a situation where you cannot.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key documents and help you should get from your lawyers:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A solid lease compliant with local laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guidance on what needs to be documented and in what format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard notices to be used as required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporating as an LLC for legal liability protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key things to document and forms to always have on hand include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addendums to the lease (parking, pets, disclosures)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move-in/move-out forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community policies and procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resident communication logs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any legal notices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic logs to keep track of potential tenants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always document tenant communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good management plan equates to two tasks: increasing income and reducing expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should think of your only goal as increasing cash flows. Cash flows are the value of the investment. Consider property appreciation as a bonus. You do not control property appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Income – expenses – debt = cash flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential elements for an revenue statement:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross potential rent income: The theoretical maximum rent that could be collected on a property if all units were offered at market rates and had 100% occupancy with paying tenants. Make sure you charge differently based on floor plan, floor, location, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain/Loss to old lease: Gross potential rent/income – Actual potential rent/income. Total amount that could be collected based on your actual leases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concessions: These are free giveaways, like one month free rent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Loss: Other categories of money that is owed to you but you cannot collect/tenants are refusing to pay (e.g. delinquent rent, unpaid late fees, damages). Essentially these are bad debts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vacancy: There are two different types of vacancy to track: physical vacancy and economic vacancy.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical vacancy = Vacancy losses / Gross potential rent income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic vacancy = . Effective rental income / (gross potential rent income – loss to old lease)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective Rental Income = Gross potential rent income – loss to old lease – concessions – other loss – vacancy losses. This is the amount of money you truly collect from rents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Income: All other non-rent income sources, such as fees, parking, laundry, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Income = Effective Rental Income + Other Income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential elements for an operating expenses statement:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional Management: Expected fees paid to professional managers. This book advises against flat rate managers because they lack skin in the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-Site Management/Payroll: Total expenses (including benefits, bonuses, taxes) to required on-site staff. Remember: quality people cost money, Trying to trim costs here too much will result in worse overall performance. Be careful to hire the right people, not just put a warm body in a seat. You will get what you pay for… and if you do not pay enough you will lose more than you save through worse tenant experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrative: Legal fees, basic office supplies, etc. This should remain relatively constant year to year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertising: All expenses related to marketing your property, such as paid listings. Be sure to carefully track your traffic sources so you know where your advertising dollars are being spent best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxes and Insurance: These should be fairly predictable. Contact your tax assessor and shop for insurance quotes if you do not already know these costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilities: Try to put as much as legally possible (and normal for the market) onto the tenant as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repairs and Maintenance: This includes all routine repair work. It does not include appliance replacements or remodeling. Those should be considered capital expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Operating Expenses: The sum of all of factors above (and any additional you find relevant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential elements for a cash flow statement:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Operating Income (NOI) = Total Income – Total Operating Expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital Expenses: Major improvements and upgrades. Generally it is a good idea to keep a cash reserve to help offset unplanned capital expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Income Before Debt =  NOI – Capital Expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt Service: Your mortgage payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash Flow: Income Before Debt – Debt Service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a template for the above in Excel is left as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This list of activities is a typical month for an owner-manager with a full-time job. Let’s cover an 8 unit apartment building renting at $1000/month with 1 vacancy. With one vacancy you are either making very little cash flow or dipping into reserves to continue operating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rent collection usually occurs from the 1st – 3rd of the month.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set specific due dates and charge late fees. Strict enforcement is essential; tenants talk and people will know they can push the limits. Fair housing laws require that you treat everyone the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are tenants paying rent online or via check? If check, you’re spending time cashing checks and chasing people down to give you checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re collecting rent in person, you’re more likely to receive verbal maintenance requests (and have people use the maintenance needs as an excuse not to pay rent).&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most owner-operators want to save money by handling small maintenance themselves. While it does save some money up-front it may be losing you money in several other ways:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a full-time job you have to schedule the repairs farther out into the future, so tenants live with incomplete necessary repairs longer. If the tenants aren’t looking for other places to live, you are probably charging much less than you could be otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are doing unit turnovers yourself, you are likely only working on weekends. The extra time it takes to make units rent-ready is lost income. Leaving a $900 unit vacant for 10 days is $300 in lost rent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tenants expect you to work on their schedule, not yours. This eats into your personal life. You may be saving $100 for an hour of work, but how many hours of stress and travel and time away from your family are you losing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tenants that are delinquent on rent owe you the full rent amount, including late fees. Accepting partial payment means you cannot evict them, since you accepted some payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When considering having someone else do the work, you need to consider whether you have the time and skillset to do the repairs and whether you have the industry contacts to get the work done at a reasonable rate. Are you going to sacrifice time with friends, family, or from work in order to get the required work done?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a bad idea to show a unit that isn’t move-in ready. It greatly reduces the appeal and value of rent you can attract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When advertising a vacant unit, are you only using free methods or effective paid advertising? When showing units, you are only available nights and weekends, so you are somewhat limiting the prospective renters available. Also, many might not make their appointments because they are shopping around for a new place to live, not just yours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to inspect work that subcontractors are doing. Unmanaged contractors will perform work to unmanaged quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book roughly estimates the time commitment for the property at 28 hours per month, not including travel time. If you make the average US hourly rate ($24.57/hr) and a property management company charges 8% of rent, then you lost just under $160 by self-managing, assuming the management company had the units at 100% occupancy and on-time payment. If not, then you would have lost nearly $320.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-do-i-find-a-good-property-manager&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how-do-i-find-a-good-property-manager&quot; aria-label=&quot;how do i find a good property manager permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How Do I Find a Good Property Manager?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, property managers do not cover the costs of operating the building. This is still the owner’s responsibility. This includes advertising rentals!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fee-based property management encourages complacency on the part of the manager. Their income should be dependent on their performance. Work hard to find a property manager that structures its fees so your incentives are truly aligned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main advantage of hiring a property manager is you no longer have to invest time and energy into your property. The best property manager is one who never calls. You should take advantage of this and let go of your emotional attachment to the property and its operations! If you cannot let go of the operations, you’re wasting your money. Just manage the property yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, focus your energy on managing the property manager. Try to pick the right management company that can meet your building’s specific needs. Consider the following areas:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age of the building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure(s): single family home? Multi-unit? Common areas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special equipment required?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grounds/landscaping requirements?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amenities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrative needs (on-site/off-site manager).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size of the building/number of units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform research for who you’re looking for on three levels:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 1 research: research you can do from your own home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 2 research: Face to face meetings to verify the information you found earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 3 research: Reaching out to your expert network to get feedback and insight beyond what you found in level 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifically, when looking for a property manager, level 1 research is finding who manages properties in your target market. It is helpful to ask local property owners, too. They will be straightforward on the quality of their managers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you’ve narrowed down the list of potential candidates, meet with them in person. Visit their office, ask about their training, policies, education systems, accounting systems, etc. Check out their properties they manage, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, do additional due diligence. Ask around, talk to industry players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have a solid contract with the property manager and that your incentives are closely aligned. Make sure responsibilities are clearly outlined. Generalizations are not acceptable: they should be clear and explicit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure the management company is a member of trade organizations. This indicates they are interested in improving their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book goes into great detail on different types of property management companies and the pros and cons of various sizes. A greatly condensed list is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National/International: Pros: Generally has standard systems and processes. Cons: Smaller properties get lost/ignored, may not have local knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regional: Pros: Well established network of local vendors. Cons: Tends to have less standardized processes, unable to absorb losses of key employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mom-and-pop: Pros: Highly personalized service. Cons: Rarely have sophisticated systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realty company: Pros: Great knowledge of local market. Cons: Management is not primary focus of business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owner/Resident management: Pros: least expensive option. Cons: May not be full aware of legal issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great companies have excel all three of the following: great employees, robust systems, and solid structure to ensure the employees and the systems interact smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they well trained? Does the company offer continuous training?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they well paid? Low pay leads to poor morale. Poor morale leads to poor profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there documented processes and policies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What system is in place for accounting? Is there an autonomous accounting department or are employees handling the accounting? The latter almost certainly will lead to poor overall results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structures:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does a company have depth? Can it absorb the loss of a key employee?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if the company has policies and processes, how do they ensure they are being followed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A property manager’s job is to add value for the property owner. Think about that for a moment. Do all property managers see their job that way? Probably not.
How can a property manager add value? One way to measure this is to increase the Net Operating Income. The is achieved through several methods: increasing rents, reducing turnovers, reducing utilities fees, and keeping maintenance costs low. Another way to add value is to maintain and improve the property’s value. For investment properties, this is achieved through the steps listed before. In addition, ensuring the low maintenance costs are not creating a deferred maintenance nightmare later down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful people are not always the smartest, most attractive or best educated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, they succeed because they know how to get along well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People respond to each other on a subconscious level. Research indicates that “as many as 10,000 units of information flow per second” between individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous proven techniques can increase your attractiveness and dynamism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People learn everything they need to know about you within the first few seconds of meeting you. Meanwhile, you are also forming powerful first impressions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You send clear signals about how you feel without saying a word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Fine-tune your smile.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make people feel great about you, focus your conversation on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people are as frightened to make small talk as they appear on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will become a far more intelligent speaker if you simply find substitutes for a few “overworked words” such as “smart, nice, pretty or good.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we consistently overestimate our ability to judge strangers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with the smallest glimmer of information, we judge people we don’t know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are incapable of spotting deception
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we assume truthfulness until the evidence pointing toward deception is overwhelming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, observers believe that most people are telling the truth. To tip from suspicion to disbelief, observers need an absolutely clear trigger. This could be clear agitation, total avoidance of eye contact or someone struggling to find words when directly accused of cheating. Without that trigger, our suspicions remain just that, and we assume truthfulness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people are better at spotting deception, but assuming the truth is important for society to function.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can celebrate perceptive skepticism, but for most of us, it doesn’t matter that we can’t spot lies. Defaulting to truth makes sense, and Bernie Madoff and Ana Montes are outliers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life isn’t like an episode of Friends – what you see on people’s faces doesn’t tell the whole story.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency is the idea that someone’s demeanour reveals an authentic picture of their feelings. It’s one of the primary expectations we have when judging strangers. The problem is that transparency is often completely misleading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When strangers aren’t transparent, we easily and completely misjudge them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some people simply aren’t transparent. They’re mismatched, or their demeanour doesn’t reflect what they’re thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alcohol can make interactions between strangers far worse, with terrible consequences
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a murky situation gets even murkier when alcohol is involved. The author believes that alcohol causes people to become myopic. Alcohol makes us disproportionately focus on short-term wants and forget about long-term consequences. Normally, we maintain a balance between the two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some ways we can get better, and the best way to start is to stop making assumptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans are ill-equipped to understand strangers. We assume that people tell the truth, so we can’t detect lies. And we believe that we can judge strangers based on little, usually deceptive, information. The result of this misplaced confidence is that we don’t invest enough time and patience in truly listening to and understanding each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin believed that similar, easily interpreted expressions – of joy, sadness, fear, surprise, and the like – were consistent for all peoples and cultures. These things are not consistent at all, which explains why people can’t accurately gauge strangers’ emotions or intent across – or even within – cultures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circumstances, Conditions and Context&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gladwell affirms that you must face the additional problem of context beyond your inability to read strangers’ emotions and your powerful bias to believe what they tell you. Where and when you meet a stranger, he emphasizes, matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe during the halcyon years before World War I, “Clever Hans, the counting horse,” was, without a doubt, the most talked-about sensation on the continent. A brilliant entertainer with a unique act, Hans could somehow supply accurate answers to math questions that audience members posed to him. He quickly tapped out the correct answers to any problem – addition, subtraction, multiplication and division – with a hoof. The horse’s owner, Herr von Osten, was always by his side while Hans performed these seemingly miraculous feats – but he never spoke to the horse or signalled him in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one had ever seen such an amazing animal! Expanding beyond math, Hans “learned the alphabet.” By tapping his hoof several times for each letter, he would answer questions from audience members concerning the latest news or subjects such as geography and history. Hans always answered every question correctly. Eventually, scientists and other leaders organized a special commission to investigate the “human horse.” They asked von Osten to leave the hall for their test. Then, they had Hans perform his usual math and language wizardry in front of a crowd. But the horse still did not miss an answer, tapping out correct responses to numerous questions from the commission’s leader. No one could stump the brainy Hans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public insisted that investigators form another commission. Members organized a second test in which the questioner whispered questions in Hans’s ear so no one else could hear. This time, Hans could not answer even a single question correctly. Instead of being brilliant, the horse was revealed as a dummkopf! Can you guess how the commission’s members proved Hans was a fraud? Von Osten had taught the horse to read the audience members’ “body-language signals.” As Hans tapped his hoof, people in the audience would exhibit clear signs of tension – straining forward, holding their breath – until the horse reached the correct number. Then they would all relax, at which point von Osten had taught Hans to stop tapping immediately. Hans was “clever” – but not because he was a math genius or geography expert. He simply knew how to take cues for his actions from the subtle responses of the people around him. “Know your audience” is one of the primary rules of effective communications. Hans, the horse, was able to learn this important lesson. Can you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most accomplished public speakers, actors, politicians and salespeople were not born charismatic. They worked hard to learn how to speak effectively, be appealing, and charm and persuade others. How did they achieve their goals? The answer is simple: They each applied certain remarkably helpful rules of personal communication and, thus, developed themselves into winning and attractive personalities. Yes, such rules exist. Furthermore, they are easy to learn and employ. You can use these secrets and tricks to re-create yourself almost magically into a person of great charm and poise and someone everyone will admire and want to be near.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First impressions are the most lasting. “The way you look and the way you move” provide 80% of the information people use to form their initial impressions of you. To make sure people get an overwhelmingly positive impression when they first meet you, use the following tips:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smile slowly&lt;/strong&gt; – Don’t smile as soon as you meet someone. People will assume that you do this with everyone. Instead, wait a second or two, look long and deep at the person you are meeting, then smile big. This brief delay signals that you are not smiling because it is socially desirable, but because you see something special in this particular person that you really like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Sticky eyes”&lt;/strong&gt; – Show people that you truly can’t take your eyes off of them. Maintain perfect eye contact while you speak with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The big baby pivot”&lt;/strong&gt; – When you meet someone, pivot directly toward him or her with a “total-body turn,” flash a genuine smile, and show the undivided and very special attention you would give to a young child who has just crawled up into your lap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Many people, including senior executives, motivational speakers and great performers, hate to make small talk. But it is an art that you can easily muster if you follow these tactics:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “mood match”&lt;/strong&gt; – Don’t speak with someone else until you first sample his or her mood. Once you have, ensure that your opening words “match that mood.” This is particularly important for salespeople.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Wear a ‘whatzit’”&lt;/strong&gt; – Starting a conversation with a stranger is not easy. One way to get the ball rolling is to wear something distinctive that he or she is sure to comment upon – a novel tie-tack, a piece of antique jewelry, or a special lapel pin or button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “swivelling spotlight”&lt;/strong&gt; – People love to speak about themselves. Imagine a giant spotlight that rotates to light up your counterpart. Keep the spotlight – and focus – on that person and not yourself. He or she will think you are great for doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can always recognize important people by the commanding, intelligent way they speak. They have confidence, choose the proper words, and don’t use clichés. Follow their lead:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Kill the quick ‘me too!‘”&lt;/strong&gt; – To impress, avoid immediately matching someone else’s account of a personal experience or preference – say, a love of sailing – with your own story. Let your shared interest come out gracefully during the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Comm-YOU-nication”&lt;/strong&gt; – Slip the word “you” into your discourse as often as possible. This focuses the content on the other person and gains his or her attention and approval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid euphemisms&lt;/strong&gt; – Always speak directly and to the point. The use of “nicey-nice” words makes you appear equivocal and weak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;To converse well with others, cure yourself of “Silent Outsider Syndrome.” Use the special words and phrases that are common parlance to the people or group that you want to join:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Learn a little ‘gobbledygook’”&lt;/strong&gt; – People will be impressed with you if you speak in terms they routinely use. Pick up the lingo by listening to others to find out what their special words and phrases mean so you can use them appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hit their “hot buttons”&lt;/strong&gt; – Each professional group has provocative issues – for example, doctors get feisty about their relationships with hospitals. Find out these issues, then mention them to spice up your exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Read their rags”&lt;/strong&gt; – The best way to gain inside knowledge about a specific field is to read the trade journals that report on it. An hour or two in the library can improve your conversational prowess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Generally, people are more comfortable with those with similar values or interests. Your job is to provoke “sensations of similarity” in the thoughts of those you want to get to know:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Join the movement”&lt;/strong&gt; – Does your conversational partner make herky-jerky movements or languid and graceful ones? Subtly match that person’s movements to make him, or her feel more comfortable with you on a subliminal basis. But don’t go overboard, or you are almost sure to offend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Echoing”&lt;/strong&gt; – What special words and phrases does your conversational partner use to describe something? “Echo” your partner and use those words yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The premature ‘we’”&lt;/strong&gt; – When you pepper your sentences with the word “we,” you establish a subconscious bond with other people involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Back in the 1930s, Dale Carnegie extolled the virtues of praise in his classic bestseller How to Win Friends and Influence People. The power of praise is just as strong today, but praise that does not appear genuine is certain to backfire, so proceed carefully using these helpers:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Grapevine glory”&lt;/strong&gt; – To praise someone without seeming to be an apple-polisher, speak highly of that person, but not directly to him or her. Instead, voice your compliment to that person’s closest friend or associate. Rest assured that the message will get delivered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Accidental adulation”&lt;/strong&gt; – Sneak praise into an otherwise mundane sentence: “Because you are so knowledgeable concerning…, I’m sure you can set the agenda.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Killer compliments”&lt;/strong&gt; – Use them whenever you can. For example, you can say, “You are the most honest person I know.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Pump up the volume”&lt;/strong&gt; – When you speak over the phone, “turn your smiles into sound.” Be animated and project a positive image through your tone of voice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Name shower”&lt;/strong&gt; – Repeat the other person’s name over and over. A person’s name is their favourite word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Oh wow, it’s you”&lt;/strong&gt; – Always answer your calls in a professional way, then switch to a very sunny, happy demeanour as soon as the caller identifies themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always put the “politician’s six-point party checklist” to work when you attend a function:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Who will be there?”&lt;/strong&gt; – After all, that’s why you’re going, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“When should I arrive?”&lt;/strong&gt; – The best advice is to get there early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What should I take with me?”&lt;/strong&gt; – At a minimum, you’ll need your business cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Why is the party being given?”&lt;/strong&gt; –Be sure and get the true reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Where is the collective mind?”&lt;/strong&gt; – Will it be a party of financiers or environmentalists?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“How am I going to follow up?”&lt;/strong&gt; – Follow up to confirm the contacts you have made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Gaffes, intemperate or insensitive comments can kill any chance you have to get ahead. To avoid doing damage, keep these strategies in mind:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“See no bloopers”&lt;/strong&gt; – Never comment on the “slips, fumbles and faux pas” of others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Savor the favour”&lt;/strong&gt; – If someone offers to do a good deed on your behalf, wait a little before you try to collect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Chance encounters are for chitchat”&lt;/strong&gt; – You have been trying to schedule an appointment to speak to the boss about increasing your salary for weeks. But don’t bring it up when you run into them in a checkout line. If you do, you’ll never get the raise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot get ahead unless you know how to speak to people so they will want to listen. Fortunately, learning this skill is within anyone’s grasp. Study how successful people accomplish this important goal – and then do what they do. It’s really as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are two kinds of people in this life: Those who walk into a room and say, ‘Well, here I am!’ And those who walk in and say, ‘Ahh, there you are’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No man would listen to you talk if he didn’t know it was his turn next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can convince you of one thing in this book, let it be this: Strangers are not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we confront a stranger we have to substitute an idea – a stereotype – for direct experience. And that stereotype is wrong all too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think we can easily see into the hearts of others based on the flimsiest of clues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides of our brains are different. The left side likes lists, sequences, logic, language, details, rules, and order. The right side pays attention to nonverbal signals, emotions, images, personal memories, music, art, creativity, and is more connected to the lower brain area that receives, understands, and processes emotional information. The two sides are connected by a bundle of fibers because we need them to work together, to be integrated. Young kids, however, are mostly operating from their right brains because they haven’t developed the abilities to use logic, understand time, use words to express feelings, etc. It’s our role to help them use both sides of their brains. Two strategies will help for kids of any age:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How A Child’s Brain Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the brain’s integration process is valuable, and can be broken down into five different types. There’s left and right brain integration, vertical and horizontal integration, memory integration, integrating the different parts of self, and finally, integrating self and other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is enormously complex with different areas performing various tasks, yet constantly interlinking. For example, the “reptilian” part of the brain makes split-second survival choices, and the ‘mammalian’ part is more concerned with relationships. Good mental health means getting all areas of the brain to work well together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To “work well together” means all the parts are integrating effectively. Horizontal integration is when the left-brain and right-brain link together. Vertical integration involves the intuitive, more primitive parts of the brain, allowing the more reasonable prefrontal cortex to pause and re-consider a little. Memory integration helps the hippocampus make implicit memories more explicit so that we can process worrying things that have occurred in the past. We can also integrate different thoughts and experiences by focusing our attention differently. And finally, we can develop our kids’ built-in capacity for social connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Connect with the Right: When kids are experiencing big emotions, they’re operating from their right brain. Logic, language, telling them it isn’t so bad, trying to distract them – none of these strategies will work because they’re left-brain strategies. Instead, use your right brain to connect, to tune in to their emotions, to resonate with your child – acknowledge their feelings. Then and only then –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Redirect with the Left: Use simple logic and language to suggest solutions to their problems. The authors caution that this does not mean permissiveness, that it takes practice to get good at this strategy, and that you have to maintain your own calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, connect with your child using a right-brain comment. Katie’s dad acknowledged that she felt sick, and said, ‘And I know that didn’t feel good, did it?’ Only then did he put the story together for Katie, using more logical details. Performing a right-brain to right-brain connection first is known as attunement. Attunement acknowledges feelings using empathetic facial expressions, a compassionate tone of voice, and nonjudgmental listening. It allows our children to ‘feel felt,’ creating a safe space to then address the situation or problem more logically. Once the brain is in a more integrated state, it’s easier to manage the left brain, and solve an issue. It doesn’t mean giving up on boundaries and discipline, nor does it mean solving problems immediately. It just reduces the emotional overload, allowing you to connect and then redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too often we “dismiss and deny” the emotional importance of life’s difficult experiences: we try to talk kids out of their feelings, or we avoid painful issues. Instead, pick a time when you and your child are feeling calm, and have a story-telling conversation about the difficult event. This strategy is integrating both sides of the brain – the left tells the story of the right brain’s strong emotion: taming by naming.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want our children to balance logic and emotions, confront their difficulties, and grow from experiences. When raw emotions do not have the left brain logic to help them, like the emotions Katie was battling with, the bank of chaos looms. On the other hand, if they deny their feelings, the shift is towards the bank of rigidity. We can help our children to build the imaginary staircase between the two levels of the brain, reminding ourselves that a child’s brain is always a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the brain as a two-story house. The downstairs brain develops early and is responsible for bodily functions like breathing, as well as for strong emotional reactions like fight (anger), flight (fear), and freeze (fear). There’s a small structure in the downstairs brain that the authors call the “baby gate” of the mind – it causes us to react emotionally without thinking. Sometimes this is good, especially when we feel passionate about someone or thing; often it gets us into trouble (when we react instead of respond to experiences that aren’t life-threatening). The upstairs brain (the top part of your cortex, especially the area behind your forehead) develops later in childhood and on into adulthood; it’s the place where mental processes happen – good decisions, self understanding, emotional and bodily control, empathy, a sense of right and wrong, etc. All the actions we hope kids will take require the upstairs brain, which isn’t fully on-line yet, but we can still appeal to it using the following strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First make sure you have applied step 1 of Strategy 1 and connect. Then, once calm, help them find solutions to their challenges. Engage their upstairs brain in problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have to ask ourselves which side of the brain we want to appeal to. If tension is building, it may help to engage the upstairs brain instead of trying to halt the rage brewing in the downstairs brain. So when you can see that your child is about to lose it, you can ask for more precise words for how they feel, and then maybe ask them to come up with a compromise that works for everybody, or start negotiating&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A strong upstairs brain balances out the downstairs brain, and is essential for social-emotional intelligence.” So throughout the day look for opportunities to help your child practice upstairs brain skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making decisions&lt;/strong&gt;: For toddlers, give choices about what to wear, what to drink, etc. For older kids, let them, with support and guidance, make more difficult choices about conflicting schedules or desires. Don’t rescue them, even if you can foresee that their choice might lead to their regret. However, help them predict possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulating emotions and the body&lt;/strong&gt;: Be sure and model this yourself in all your interactions with your kids. Teach them calming techniques like taking a deep breath (“Swallow a bubble,” “Take a belly breath.”). Older kids can learn to count to ten, or take a mental time-out. Self-understanding: Ask kids questions that help them think about and reflect on their feelings, help them predict what they might feel in a new situation &amp;#x26; how they might handle it. Also, model this for them by using self-talk out loud, “Hmmm. I seem to feel extra nervous. I wonder why? Maybe it’s because I don’t know what my boss will say when I ask for time off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy&lt;/strong&gt;: Ask kids questions about the feelings of others, about what someone’s actions might suggest about how they feel, about what might make someone feel better, etc. Show compassion and empathy yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morality&lt;/strong&gt;: This isn’t just knowing what’s right and wrong but understanding how actions impact the greater good. We want our kids to do the right thing with compassion, kindness, and empathy – not because someone’s watching, but because they know right from wrong. The authors give examples of questions and situations to develop this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories aren’t like photocopy machines that produce accurate pictures of what took place in the past. The hippocampus stores memory with an overlay of emotion, and our memories always coexist with the feelings we attach to an event. Memory also isn’t like a filing cabinet, where we simply pull them out when we need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children associate past experiences with what might happen in the future. They then react accordingly. Once an implicit memory is spoken about and understood, it becomes explicit and, therefore, easier to deal with any fears they may have. Children don’t just forget about difficult experiences; we have to help them understand what happened, and how they felt about it. Then, just like a jigsaw puzzle, put all the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movement changes brain chemistry, so when kids are near a breaking point and aren’t connecting with their upstairs brain, get them moving to integrate their brain. The same is true for adults.&lt;/li&gt;

Integrating Memory for Growth and Healing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memories are tricky because they’re not just experiences filed away in a file cabinet, exactly as they happened. And they’re not exact photocopies of the experience, either. In this chapter you’ll learn about two different kinds of memory, and how to help your kids (and yourself) integrate them. If we don’t help our kids integrate their difficult memories, their emotions will show up in their behavior – which can confuse both them and us. And it’s important to remember that what’s a challenging memory for a child might seem pretty harmless to us. The authors use cute cartoon drawings and catchy sayings to illustrate the strategies:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as telling a “story” or narrative about a strong emotion is naming it to tame it, here we help kids get in touch with their unhappy and challenging memories to integrate them. The authors suggest we guide kids to think of their minds as a remote control that can fast-forward, skip, pause, and stop when remembering painful experiences. As adults, we should help them “rewind and remember” instead of “fast-forward and forget.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make daily family conversations a habit so kids always have a chance to talk about their experiences and memories. Ask open-ended questions that will get them thinking and encourage them to share more than a “yes” or “no.” Instead of the usual, “How was your day?” ask them questions like, “What was your favorite part of the day?” and “Tell me about recess.” Ask them about their not-so favorite parts of the day, too. Print those digital photos and make books and albums for your kids so you can talk about shared experiences together. Have a regular family movie night where you watch movies you’ve made of your kids, family, and experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chapter the authors introduce the idea of “Mindsight,” a term coined by Dan Siegel that mean understanding our own minds, which then we can then use to understand the minds of others. In this chapter you’ll read how to teach kids about the wheel of awareness, telling the difference between what they feel and who they are, learn to focus their attention, and learn to get back to their hub (center). This will help them develop Mindsight. Most of these concepts are for K-12 kids, but you yourself will benefit from applying them to your own mind. By modeling this for younger kids, you’ll be preparing them to use Mindsight as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help children to integrate their memories, feelings, and thoughts in order to understand their minds. When they learn that they have some choice about how they feel or respond to situations, it’s very empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching kids to get in touch with and verbalize their feelings is a good strategy. But it’s also important to teach them that feelings are temporary and changeable, like the weather. This helps them put feelings in perspective – they won’t last forever. This will help them regain a calm state more easily and maintain it when painful feelings come along.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teach kids to know what’s on the rim of their wheel of awareness and focus their attention on the following: the Sensations (messages) their body sends them; the Images they have from their experiences and imagination (from the right brain); the Feelings they have (right brain); and the Thoughts they are using to understand their world (left brain). This process is the basis for Mindsight and the chapter has strategies to make it fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIFT is the acronym for sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts. We can use this acronym to help children sort through physical sensations such as butterflies in the tummy, images that might be worrying them, such as an embarrassing moment at school, and feelings. It helps if they have a broad “feeling” vocabulary, so they can use specific words like “disappointed,” as opposed to a more general one like feeling “sad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children can also learn that they don’t have to believe all their thoughts. We can encourage them to argue with the ones that may not be true. And we can teach them strategies that calm them, like visualization techniques or imagining a place where they feel calm and peaceful. If they can access a sense of stillness and calm, they can learn to separate from and manage the storms that brew around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By teaching kids that they can choose how to think and feel about what happens to them in life, that they aren’t victims, that they can use their mind to calm their brain, they’ll thrive. The authors present ways to help kids get in touch with their “hub,” that peaceful, calm center.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to help kids develop the second aspect of Mindsight – to integrate self and other – and develop relationships based on kindness, compassion, and empathy. Using the Mindsight skills they’re learning, with help from you and the developmental process, they can now learn to combine insight with empathy to develop interpersonal integration. It’s up to adults to create positive relationships with kids; to encourage them to make friends and form relationships by helping them be receptive instead of reactive, and to use Mindsight skills with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes children need a little bit of help with their empathy and to recognize others’ needs and perspectives. Enter the fascinating discovery of mirror neurons. Our brains are activated to respond to the actions of somebody else. We can nurture this built-in wiring in our children to create more empathy. For example, if we see someone in tears, we often become tearful too. Our bodies automatically respond to someone else’s emotions and actions. We mirror them. Hence, our kids can learn to empathize with others, without losing their sense of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend time having fun, playing, and enjoying each other’s company. Every time you have enjoyable experiences with kids, their brains release a “reward” chemical called dopamine, and they learn that relationships are rewarding. You’ve probably tried some of the suggestions to implement this strategy – and if you haven’t, the time to start is now!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict is unavoidable in relationships, so teach kids how to handle it in helpful ways using Mindsight: 1. recognize others’ perspectives and viewpoints (teach them previous strategies); 2. teach them to understand nonverbal cues so they can attune with others; 3. teach them to repair the relationship after conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our children argue or complain about something someone said to them, we can ask them to explore the other person’s perspective. They can look at why they thought this person responded differently, and explore another’s reactions without being defensive. They can observe someone’s non-verbal behavior to understand what emotions they might have. We can also teach them to fix things after a fight by discussing how they can make amends. This could be through a kind act, or a letter of apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The growth mindset does allow people to love what they’re doing—and to continue to love it in the face of difficulties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those with the growth mindset found success in doing their best, in learning and improving. And this is exactly what we find in the champions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fixed mindset: I can’t do it. The growth mindset: I can’t do it yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;fixed-mindsets-vs-growth-mindsets&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fixed-mindsets-vs-growth-mindsets&quot; aria-label=&quot;fixed mindsets vs growth mindsets permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fixed mindsets vs growth mindsets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fixed mindset&lt;/strong&gt; is the belief that the intelligence and qualities a person is born with remain the same throughout his or her life. People with the fixed mindset view failure as intolerable, and spend much of their time trying to prove to themselves and others how smart and/or talented they are. They do not believe in the power of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;growth mindset&lt;/strong&gt; is the belief that with hard work and experience, growth and development occur. This mindset creates a desire to learn. Those with the growth mindset see failure as an opportunity to learn, and they value risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fixed mindsets prevent growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with a Fixed Mindset are often worried about what other people think. As they often judge others based on their aptitude for a task, they also assume others judge them all the time. Hence, people with a Fixed Mindset are obsessed with showing how talented and smart they are. In fact, Carol suggests that those with a Fixed Mindset revolve their whole personality around their talent. Subsequently, they need approval from others to protect their personalities and egos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;growth mindsets encourage development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sky’s the limit for people like this, as they are always seeking to find new ways to learn. Importantly, individuals with Growth Mindsets are not fixated on being better than other people or receiving the best grades. These individuals obtain satisfaction from pushing themselves to the limit to help themselves grow. They will practice relentlessly and are aware that you have to work your hardest, and overcome some failures, to improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with a Growth Mindset enjoy being around people who are more skilled than them. They see spending time with more talented individuals as opportunities to learn new skills. Additionally, these people are always willing to discard a strategy if it is no longer working and replace it with a new approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As well as improving themselves, individuals with a growth mindset encourage the surrounding people to continue learning and working on themselves. They understand that life is about working as a team. When others are happier or more successful, they are more likely to succeed themselves. As business owners, individuals with a Growth Mindset are respectful to their team members and grateful for their work. Additionally, they are open to others’ opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fixed mindsets seek approval; growth mindsets seek development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lou Gerstner took over IBM when it was similarly in a difficult spot. The environment was in a Fixed Mindset and wasting energy on internal disagreements. Each employee was merely doing what was best for themselves. Subsequently, the company was not meeting its customer needs. Gerstner changed this by breaking down the company’s hierarchy, emphasizing teamwork, and rewarding employees who supported their coworkers. Additionally, he put himself on the same level as his employees. This allowed him to engage with as many employees as possible. Gerstner was adopting a Growth Mindset, and this enabled shared development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gerstner’s Growth Mindset enabled him to create a new work environment based on teamwork and development. The focus moved away from individuals’ success and towards shared development. He was able to bring about lasting success at IBM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Mindsets See Failures as Disasters; Growth Mindsets See Failures as Opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of Your Mindset&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carol explains that individuals with a Fixed Mindset do not believe they can learn from their mistakes. Any failure is used as justification for their future being filled with failures. Additionally, any defeat cancels out all the individual’s previous successes. As this approach diminishes their self-confidence, Fixed Mindsets will often blame other people or circumstances for their failures. Alternatively, they will seek ways to cheat to get ahead. Instead of analyzing their weaknesses and improving based on their failures, they try to forget. These behaviors are underpinned by Fixed Mindsets believing that they are the finished product rather than a continual process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carol provides basketball legend Michael Jordan as an example of an individual with a Growth Mindset. Although Jordan is arguably the greatest sportsman ever to live, he was imperfect. He missed some dunks, and he missed some game-winning shots. However, the critical matter is how Jordan responded to these misses. After making mistakes, he would practice the missed shot over and over again. Jordan’s ability to learn from his mistakes and practice these weaknesses brought him so much success. Jordan did not find fault in his teammates or his shoes for his own mistakes. Additionally, it is well-known that Jordan was a driving force behind his teammates’ improvements. Jordan wanted his teammates to be the best they could be. So, he always supported them in improving their game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Mindsets Avoid Difficulties; Growth Mindsets Relish Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While people with a Fixed Mindset get a thrill from easy things, people with a Growth Mindset get a thrill from what is complex. Fixed Mindsets struggle with difficult situations because they have to invest in making a positive outcome out of these situations. Effort is fundamental to success. However, people with a Fixed Mindset see situations where they have to spend more time and energy as a risk. The more time or energy they invest in a situation, the harder it becomes to blame external factors if they fail. The Fixed Mindsets avoid difficult situations as they do not want to question their talent or potentially make a fool of themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE GROWTH MINDSET BUILDS CHARACTER—A KEY COMPONENT TO SUCCESS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Character comes from the growth mindset and the idea that when things go wrong, there are effective strategies that can be used to cope with or overcome them. Character gives a person the ability to keep going even when things get really difficult. It is the ability to stretch yourself beyond what you think is humanly possible, to maintain focus and positivity when things get unbearable, and to consistently work hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those with the fixed mindset focus on proving that they are better than everyone else, while those with the growth mindset strive only to be the best they can possibly be.  They figure out and take the steps necessary to succeed and to keep succeeding. Many great athletes shared that they have found more fulfillment in personal growth than in winning or achieving fame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;impact of your parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our mindsets start developing from birth. However, all babies are born with a Growth Mindset. Babies are curious about the world and want to learn and grow as much as possible each day. Therefore, it is the child’s environment growing up that determines whether the child maintains this Growth desire or eventually adopts a Fixed mindset. The most crucial agent in this shift is usually your parents. Parents have their mindset, and this will set an example for their children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parents with a Growth Mindset will encourage their children to continue learning and questioning everything. Comparatively, parents with a Fixed Mindset will parent through judgment, punishment, and telling the children what is right and wrong. These parenting styles impact babies as young as 1. For example, babies with a Growth Mindset will help other babies when they are crying. In contrast, babies with a Fixed Mindset are annoyed when other babies are crying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of Your Teachers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to parents, teachers are also fundamental role models in defining children’s mindsets. Some teachers adopt a Fixed Mindset by believing the ability of their students is unchangeable. In effect, they believe that some children are naturally intelligent, and others are destined to fail. However, there are many good teachers, also. These teachers will adopt a Growth Mindset by believing all their students are capable of learning anything. The teaching style of these teachers is more adaptable and places faith in the students. Generally, this teaching style helps all students perform better, even those who seemed doomed to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;anyone-can-adopt-a-growth-mindset&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#anyone-can-adopt-a-growth-mindset&quot; aria-label=&quot;anyone can adopt a growth mindset permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Anyone can adopt a growth mindset&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moving towards growth mindsets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A journey towards a Growth Mindset also opens opportunities for developing concrete life plans. Developing a Growth Mindset will take time and the support of others around us. Therefore, we want supportive and honest people who are willing to talk to us about our mistakes and weaknesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;breaking away from fixed mindsets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking away from a Fixed Mindset can be particularly challenging. Fixed Mindsets are habits we have built over many years to protect us emotionally from our failures. Additionally, a lot of us will be reliant on our Fixed Mindset for our self-confidence. Suppose you are genuinely struggling to kick your Fixed Mindset. In that case, Carol suggests that adopting the Growth Perspective in certain situations is enough to have a positive impact. For example, you might accept you are terrible at sport. Despite this, you will apply a Growth Perspective to the most important things: Work, parenting, or studying. Additionally, you don’t only possess one mindset. Most people have elements of both that apply to different areas of their life. Therefore, your first task is to identify which areas you possess which mindset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carol outlines that a Growth Mindset helps make the impossible possible. She encourages each of us to look at the most successful people globally and consider how they would respond to failure. Likely, you will find that they used failures along the way to reach their success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Have Greater Opportunities, but We All Have a Chance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be naive to say that effort is the only thing that’s important in succeeding. Effort is significant and is why those with a Growth Mindset increase their chances of success. Though, many other factors influence your chances of success. For example, Carol explains that resources and opportunities are useful for success. Those born into influential families with better access to education have a much higher chance of success. However, although your starting point matters, this does not mean you shouldn’t improve and create the best endpoint possible based on your opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importantly, Carol concludes by stating that a Growth Mindset does not mean we should try to improve everything. Sometimes the wisest decision is to accept our imperfections, especially those that will cause little harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;applying the growth and fixed mindsets to business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most successful business managers are not natural talents who ooze ego. Instead, they are the individual who is continuously looking to learn. They are also willing to ask questions and are not afraid to fail in front of their employees. They keep faith in their team to improve when they have made a mistake, rather than deeming them failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In contrast, Fixed Mindset bosses are dangerous. They often seek to be controlling and abusive to showcase their superiority. These behaviors push their fellow employees to adopt Fixed Mindsets, as well. Hence, instead of moving forward through learning, the company will be fixated on individual goals. Additionally, they will aim to obtain short-term goals by covering up mistakes and screwing other people over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying the Growth and Fixed Mindsets to Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationships can often be complicated, and most of us will have multiple failed romantic relationships throughout our life. Individuals with a Fixed Mindset see these failed relationships as a defining feature of themselves. They label themselves as unlovable and want revenge for the rejection they have experienced. People with a Growth Mindset will also find rejection difficult. However, they will also see it as an opportunity to reflect on where things went wrong in the relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, the two mindsets have different levels of success in relationships. Relationships based on Fixed Mindsets are destined to fail, as both parties will be expecting everything to be perfect with no effort. Additionally, both parties believe that love can solve everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 actions for you&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about how you can put yourself into a growth mindset more often. What triggers your fixed mindset and how you can deal with it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When praising your children, praise effort and progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about how you can demonstrate growth mindset to your children&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We don’t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, and keep on learning. That way, their children don’t have to be slaves of praise. They will have a lifelong way to build and repair their own confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindset change is not about picking up a few pointers here and there. It’s about seeing things in a new way. When people…change to a growth mindset, they change from a judge-and-be-judged framework to a learn-and-help-learn framework. Their commitment is to growth, and growth take plenty of time, effort, and mutual support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although people may differ in every which way – in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments – everyone can change and grow through application and experience. — Carol Dweck, Mindset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Children with a growth mindset] knew that human qualities, such as intellectual skills, could be cultivated through effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were [the children with a growth mindset]not discouraged by failure, they didn’t even think they were failing. They thought they were learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the consequences of thinking that your intelligence or personality is something you can develop, as opposed to something that is a fixed, deep-seated trait?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Sternberg, the present-day guru of intelligence, writes that the major factor in whether people achieve expertise ‘is not some fixed prior ability, but purposeful engagement’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For twenty years, my research has shown that the view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing that your qualities are carved in stone—the fixed mindset—creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ in every which way—in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments—everyone can change and grow through application and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fixed mindset makes you concerned with how you’ll be judged; the growth mindset makes you concerned with improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you enter a mindset, you enter a new world. In one world—the world of fixed traits—success is about proving you’re smart or talented. Validating yourself. In the other—the world of changing qualities—it’s about stretching yourself to learn something new. Developing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Barber, an eminent sociologist, once said, ‘I don’t divide the world into the weak and the strong, or the successes and the failures…. I divide the world into the learners and non-learners’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in a growth mindset don’t just seek challenge, they thrive on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gave fifth graders intriguing puzzles, which they all loved. But when we made them harder, children with the fixed mindset showed a big plunge in enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For [people with a growth mindset] it’s not about immediate perfection. It’s about learning something over time: confronting a challenge and making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Becoming is better than being’. The fixed mindset does not allow people the luxury of becoming. They have to already be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with the growth mindset know that it takes time for potential to flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College students, after doing poorly on a test, were given a chance to look at tests of other students. Those in the growth mindset looked at the tests of people who had done far better than they had. As usual, they wanted to correct their deficiency. But students in the fixed mindset chose to look at the tests of people who had done really poorly. That was their way of feeling better about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Wooden, the legendary basketball coach, says you aren’t a failure until you start to blame. What he means is that you can still be in the process of learning from your mistakes until you deny them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French executive Pierre Chevalier says, ‘We are not a nation of effort. After all, if you have savoir-faire [a mixture of know-how and cool], you do things effortlessly’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with the growth mindset, however, believe something very different. For them, even geniuses have to work hard for their achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may appreciate endowment, but they admire effort, for no matter what your ability is, effort is what ignites that ability and turns it into accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth mindset does allow people to love what they’re doing—and to continue to love it in the face of difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with the growth mindset found success in doing their best, in learning and improving. And this is exactly what we find in the champions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with the growth mindset found setbacks motivating. They’re informative. They’re a wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with the growth mindset in sports (as in pre-med chemistry) took charge of the processes that bring success—and that maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One that stood out for me is the idea that there are three major breakthroughs throughout human history. And each was prompted initially by geographical factors — purely incidental and arbitrary you could say, which gave certain areas of the world a leg-up in achieving unprecedented development and subsequently more advanced form of civilization as measured by Morris’ four metrics of human society. However, since we are instinctive animals produced by millions of years of evolution, some of the primal desires are coded in our DNA. That is, by design, we humans gravitate towards some sort of equality; more specifically, “equity in outcomes on emotional grounds and fairness in opportunities on rational basis”. Thus, when the advancement finally spreads to other parts of the world, whether by design or by chance, the inhabitants of those places would naturally want to adapt (if they in fact see it as such). And if they don’t, as exemplified by the Chinese Qing Dynasty refusing to concede to Western “tricks and gimmicks” (what we now call science and technology), there is a dear price to pay. But of course, eventually history will power through any willful ignorance and blind denial, and incorporate them into the process one way or another, no matter how “central” they think they are (Note: China, or Zhong Guo, essentially means “the central country” in Chinese). To adapt or to perish, it’s a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts out by covering a broad topic: human civilization. From attempting to understand our shared two-million-year-old past, Lu hopes to gain some foresight as to what awaits us in our future. A few books he referenced are also a few of my favorites on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jared Diamond — Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yuval Noah Harari — Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ian Morris — Why the West Rules — For Now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E. O. Wilson — The Social Conquest of Earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From these books, Lu introduces our civilization in three stages:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civilization 1.0 — Hunter-Gatherer Age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civilization 2.0 — Agricultural Age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civilization 3.0 — Industrial/Technological Age (modern civilization)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jared Diamond famously stated that the rise of European and Asian powers in the Agricultural Age was predetermined by geography and climate. Out of all the edible grains in the world, only five (wheat, corn, rice, barley and sorghum) stood out as the main sources of energy consumption for humans. When it comes to animal husbandry, out of 148 mammals on earth, we were only able to domesticate 14 types of animals. In addition, out of the five most important domesticated animals today (sheep, goats, cows, pigs and horses), four could trace their origins to Southwest Asia. Naturally, where these grains grow and harvest the best and where these animals were able to survive would also determine where humans flourished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental difference between civilizations 2.0 and 3.0 is that 2.0 operates under a system characterized by shortages. That is, the growth of a society is limited by its agricultural output, which is in turn dictated by natural forces such as seasons, climate and photosynthesis. Once a society grows to a certain size, it inevitably falls into the Malthusian trap, where a significant amount of the population has to die out in order for the society to revert back to a point of equilibrium. Sounds incredibly cruel and reminiscent of Marvel’s almighty, mission-driven, almost reasonable villain, Thanos, who decided that half of randomly selected humans must perish (like, literally turning into ashes) in order to save the Earth and so he set out to do just that. Well, guess what? Civilization 3.0 powered by free market and technological advancements and capable of unlimited growth, come to rescue. I know, I know. We also run a greater risk of perishing altogether thanks to our unbounded power to destroy, you smart son of a gun. Can we just play along for now? Anyhow, the West boarded the first 3.0 train this time around and developed so quickly like no one had seen before. In the proceeding centuries, several Asian countries followed, first Japan, then South Korea, Singapore, now China. They all showed likewise pattern regardless of their political systems: one-party, two-party or multi-party rule; direct or indirect democracy; capitalism or communism — different paths, same destination that is unlimited, explosive, constant economic growth and a civilization of materialistic abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the book’s focus on civilization, however, revolves around “civilization 3.0” — industrial revolution, technological revolution and modernization. Lu starts out the discussion at Axial Age, a period between 8th to the 3rd century BCE, named by German philosopher Carl Jaspers. During these years, humans “leveled up” their thinking and understanding of philosophy and religion and achieved cultural and spiritual awakening. The thinkers during these years still influences the way we think today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In China, philosophers like Confucius, LaoZi, and Mozi along with the Hundred School of Thoughts appeared during the Warring States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Nepal and India, we witnessed the birth of the Buddha, hinduism, buddhism, along with nihilism and scepticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Middle East, prophets started recording their teachings and thoughts, forming the basis for modern Catholic and Islamic faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Greece and western Europe, Homer and Plato became immensely popular, influencing Christianity and even Renaissance that came centuries afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaspers noted in his book Origin and Goal of History that these great thinkers shared many similarities. They all existed in a period of great struggle and uncertainty, with governments that were autocratic and corrupt. Their audiences were mainly the lowest class of citizens, minorities, and the repressed. Although their teachings were often revolutionary, they weren’t actual revolutionists. The intent was often simpler: to understand the meaning of life and what makes a society fairer and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu’s interpretation here is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;human nature dictates that emotionally we pursue the equality of results (resources and money) and rationally the equality of opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a very important notion. By linking human nature directly with the pursuit of equality and fairness, he is able to explain to his readers that the following are the the greatest innovations of human civilization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free market economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ke Ju (科举制, civil service examination system based on meritocracy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ke Ju (科举制)&lt;/strong&gt; came first. The Chinese imperial examination system (~220 B.c.) was used to recruit talent from all over the country to make up its governing body. It took both attitude and aptitude into consideration, and promised a fair, open, and transparent chance for all, regardless of family background or upbringing like the systems prior. Because of this universal recruiting method, China was able to incentivize talent to participate in government and politics, provide upward mobility for its citizens, and to economically lead the world for more than ten centuries afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lying beneath the seemly mundane surface are two protruding factors that likely affected the trajectory of either societies as far as I can see based on what I learned from the book. First of all, despite of its tremendous benefits, Keju has its flaws and is far from enough to sustain China’s evergrowing population and advancing society. It grants political privileges to whomever willing to and capable of passing a series of examinations, that promised a pathway for anyone (theoretically) to rise to political prominence. But! Ultimately there’s a limit to how far one can go. That is, the throne. And given the position of the highest ruler can only be inherited, not earned, it is up to that one individual and his (yes, the vast majority, if not all, of them were men) select trustees, often related to him by blood or through marriage as well, to determine what happens to the entire empire — the largest on earth at the time. It is their wisdom, character, knowledge and ability the whole country relies upon for peace, survival and continuation. If that’s not a crapshoot I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keju was also limited in its rigidity, though technically it didn’t have to be. Ming Dynasty is infamous for its turning its bureaucrat selection system into a “word prison” or, perhaps more fittingly, “hell of words”. The empire’s gradual loss of toleration in free thoughts and original ideas, and eventually loss of interest in assessing candidates on what could be practical or functional in serving the empire, which is what the Keju system was designed to do, probably predated the rise of Ming Tai Zu (first Emperor of Ming Dynasty) by many centuries. And the reason behind that, in hindsight at least, is pretty clear. Whatever the system was selecting, it was meant to serve the ruler, the throne, the product of the crapshoot that may or may not (and most likely not) care about the millions of people outside of his fortress, whom supposedly were born to serve him, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is no mentioning of economic meritocracy alongside its political counterpart. It is well-known that businessmen are at the very bottom in terms of the traditional Chinese hierarchy of noble career choices for the plebs. I’m referring to the “bureaucrats, peasants, craftsmen, and businessmen” (in descending order)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the 1200s and &lt;strong&gt;Magna Carta&lt;/strong&gt;, then 1689 and the &lt;strong&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/strong&gt;, Europeans slowly started taking power away from the crown and into the hands of the “people” (represented by the wealthy). In Britain, these important policy changes marked the transition to limited constitutional monarchy, arguably equally significantly, the first “commercial constitutional state” — one where the House of Commons represents the interests of businessmen and property owners. It sets Britain up to become the indisputable commercial hub of the 17th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also at this critical juncture in history, a transcontinental trade network was quietly being established in the Atlantic, starting with the discovery of the Americas in end of the 15th century. &lt;strong&gt;The Transatlantic Trade Network&lt;/strong&gt; was the first decentralized market ecosystem not controlled by a single nation state and an experiment of true free capitalism. The pros and cons of such a bold experiment are still being felt today, from social issues like racism in the Americas to economic ones like the impact of globalization and monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu also reiterates the importance of free market economy by pointing out that 1776 was a special year, where a series of important events happened that officially transitioned the western world into civilization 3.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adam Smith’s &lt;strong&gt;Wealth of the Nation&lt;/strong&gt;, setting the foundation of a free market economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Founding Father’s &lt;strong&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/strong&gt;, creating rule of law and centuries of prosperity in a new nation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Watt steam engine&lt;/strong&gt; is commercialized and the design is sold to Carron Company ironworks, officially kicking off the industrial revolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Smith is well known today as the father of economics and modern capitalism. Almost weekly on CNBC, people still reference the “invisible hand” of the market, a concept Adam Smith coined to describe the automatic pricing mechanism in an economy. Adam Smith’s concept of the &lt;strong&gt;“invisible hand”&lt;/strong&gt; was less biased than modern interpretations. Today, the free market ideology largely uses it to justify that while unfettered by the intervention of government regulations, society would flourish organically due to the competition that it naturally fosters. A smaller government should always function better because it leaves room for private ownership and partnerships, and creates as little resistance to the “invisible hand” as possible. Greed of the consumers that demand the best product at the lowest price would drive the market to a point of absolute efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Declaration of Independence&lt;/strong&gt; and the steam engine need no further introduction. Lu highlights the importance of &lt;strong&gt;rule of law&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;technological achievements&lt;/strong&gt; in the modernization of the western world, the former surrendered by the monarch, and the latter made possible by free market competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;monopolies-and-the-free-market&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#monopolies-and-the-free-market&quot; aria-label=&quot;monopolies and the free market permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Monopolies and the Free Market&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monopolies took many forms throughout human history — from forms of governments like city states and nation states to joint stock companies like the EICs (East India Company). There seems to be a natural tendency for humans to form these all powerful entities in order to achieve greater degree of control. Lu proposes another way to look at monopoly that I never considered before: a global marketplace being a monopoly, from which he summarizes the Iron Law for the Civilization 3.0:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一个自由竞争的市场就是一个不断自我进化、自我进步、自我完善的机制，现代科技的介入使得这一过程异常迅猛。这样在相互竞争的不同市场之间，最大的市场最终会成为唯一的市场，任何人、企业、社会、国家，离开这个最大的市场之后就会不断落后，并最终被迫加入。一个国家增加实力最好的方法是放弃自己的关税壁垒，加入到这个全球最大的国际自由市场体系里去；反之，闭关锁国就会导致相对落后。这就是3.0文明的铁律。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The only way to survive is to join in on the biggest global free market. Any entity attempting to create barrier (ie raise tariffs), break away to create smaller regional markets, will eventually become obsolete and will be forced to rejoin the monopoly later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lu, humans fought for control over land in civilization 2.0 (Agricultural Age). In civilization 3.0, we fight for the control over the global market monopoly. The size of an economy’s market determines its longevity. After WWII, United States gave up a lot of land it captured. Instead, it started forming a series of global organizations, such as the United Nations, World Bank, IMF, and Bretton Woods. These international organizations essentially set up a global marketplace. The U.S. also fought hard to hold on to the rights of creating, changing, and enforcing the rules of this marketplace. Initiatives like the Marshall Plan and security treaties with Japan and Korea can also be seen as such efforts. The establishment of a global marketplace also greatly accelerated the effect of globalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globalization is a very unique phenomenon in human history. A completely global free market economy we have today really only existed for 30 years or so, since the end of the Cold War in 1989. During the Cold War, we had two major economic sphere of influences. Both superpowers used trade sanctions, embargoes, and blockage of financial access as means of economic warfare. Eventually, only one market prevailed, and we are living in a world order created by that monopoly today: &lt;strong&gt;dollar is the dominant world currency, english is the world’s language, Hollywood is the world’s culture, and the U.S. military is the world’s police force.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To discuss the Chinese economy, it’s hard not to talk about John Maynard Keynes. The Keynesian school of economics largely came out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. Contrast to Adam Smith, Kaynes believed that the “visible hand” of the government can help stabilizing the economy through manufactured demand and centralized workforce, thus pulling the U.S. out of economic depressions via increased governmental debt and expenditure. MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) can be seen as an extension of Keynesian Economics. And China has been riding the quasi-MMT train for quite a while&lt;/li&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese businesses deeply understand the meaning of this “visible hand” from its government. For thousands of years, the Chinese government had always managed its economy, effectively creating a repeated business cycle of opening, prosperity, intervention, lockdown, and reopening. In the past 40 years after Deng, the Chinese economy entered another “opening and prosperity” phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu noted that even though the exponential growth of China has been impressive, the trend is unlikely to continue unless certain policies are significantly altered going forward. When an economy is transitioning from “developing” to “developed,” it’s relatively easy to follow the path that others have laid before and copy as much as they can. This playbook isn’t new either — almost all Asian countries (Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand to a lesser extent) rose up in the 90s with the help of central planning. A famous account of Japanese Central Bank’s aggressive policies in the 80s and 90s, such as window guidance, can be found in Richard Werner’s book Princes of the Yen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period of prosperity, the Chinese government relied heavily on exporting manufacturing (cheap labor) and smart/effective central planning. They guided investments and capital domestically and internationally into important infrastructure projects and achieved unprecedented progress in a short period of time. However, as China surpasses the U.S. and became the number one export nation in 2019, it now needs to turn inwards to seek additional growth. At the same time, as investments continue to creep up and make up almost half of China’s GDP, the government will be forced to let go of some of its control on the economy, and give more leniency to the “invisible hand” of the free market. The takeaway here is simple: &lt;strong&gt;a centrally planned economy is a short term, opportunistic band-aid solution; it can never be as effective as free market economy during a time of uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt; — when there’s no more path laid out in front by others, governments tend to react slower and are at a position of disadvantage. Hence, Lu lays out his first prediction of China’s future: &lt;strong&gt;it has to transition from a government-controlled economy to a government-assisted free economy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this prediction seems overly optimistic, though still quite fun to think about. As China transforms itself into a domestically service oriented economy, consumers will likely demand a more open and transparent society (or at least a fairer financial market). State-owned enterprises (国企) should not be able to borrow the same way they do today, with basically no obligation to repay debt without fear for bankruptcy. Any citizen should be able to participate in the industries that are traditionally limited to certain state-backed companies (finance, energy, or even defense). Financial markets will have to be regulated to attract more institutional capital and stability. Pension systems and social welfare can then be more privatized and therefore not solely be the burden of the central government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thought-provoking takeaway from the later part of the book is central government’s place in a nation’s economy. After all, “free market is by no means free”, Li observes. Indeed, to ensure the proper functioning of a large free market is no small undertaking. It requires tremendous amount of funds and effort that no individual company or industry could or, I would argue, should provide. That said, Li agrees that governments have different roles to play depending on a country’s stage of economic development. There are two turning points marking three stages of economic development in a post-agricultural society. The first being the Lewis Turning Point raised by English economist W. Arthur Lewis. Before the arrival of this turning point, Lewis proposes, capital has absolute dominating power over labor. Labor skills are low and often in high supply thanks to former agricultural workers pouring into cities for higher-paying modern jobs. Therefore, wages are uniformly low, so are unit price and profit margin. At this stage saving may be citizens’ main goal; thus, it makes sense for government to indirectly participate in the economy — borrowing money from the savers and invest it into the economy either by lending to sprouting businesses or by establishing state-owned enterprises to build and strengthen infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to see all economies hang out in this sweet spot till the end of time; however, history teaches us that nothing lasts. Increasingly we see developed countries, burdened by low birth rate and aging population, having low or negative interest rates. Fiscal policy that used to work like magic for the longest time stopped working; people became more and more reluctant to spend no matter how low interest rates are. This phenomenon was brought to spotlight by economist Richard Koo, observing the lack of vitality in Japanese economy since the 1990s. Once a society arrives at this stage, it would again make sense for the “Big Brother” to take action and assume an active role in the economy as in stage I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality, of course, is not as clear-cut. And governments around the world are generally large, cumbersome political machines characterized by bureaucracy, inertia and latency in execution. The size of a country matters, and so do culture and ingrained beliefs and perception about the government’s role. For countries like China, where for centuries central government has always taken on an active role on the economic stage, it may be hard to convince policy makers at various levels to chill out a little and loosen their grip on the economy. However, with China approaching (some may say having passed) the Lewis Turning Point, this becomes increasingly important and should be done sooner rather than later. I’m fairly hopeful it will happen though. After all, thanks to modern-day version of Keju, China’s got the most capable and efficient bunch of bureaucrats working towards its renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, countries heading towards or perhaps had already crossed the second turning point, given their long-running democratic tradition, may have a hard time adjusting to the fact that even the most powerful machine — the free market — may need an oil change. This can finally become reality in the US with Trump disgracefully shooed out of the White House. Will American government show as much vigor and determination as T.R.’s administration did back in the Great Depression? Will Americans, increasingly radicalized and divided, be on board? I sure hope so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author focused on the issue of &lt;strong&gt;culture and tradition abandonment&lt;/strong&gt; by most Chinese living in China today. He believes that a country’s culture is “consisted of centuries of habits and traditions, religions and history.” It’s an all-encompassing belief and faith system that cannot be replaced, it’s “deep in the bones.” Through cultural revolution, China had attempted to erase just that. The author predicts that in the near future, we will see a movement of &lt;strong&gt;Chinese Culture Renaissance&lt;/strong&gt;. To him, Chinese people must learn to embrace their own culture again before moving into the civilization 3.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of governance and politics, Lu briefly covered three major schools of thought: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ru(儒) or Confucianism&lt;/em&gt;, Dao(道) or Taoism, Fa(法) or Legalism&lt;/strong&gt;. In Chinese politics, it is often believed that achieving a balance among the three can guarantee the success of a dynasty or ruler. Lu believes another school of thought, &lt;strong&gt;Mo(墨) or Mohism&lt;/strong&gt; should play a more pivotal role as China enters its modernization phase. Mohism emphasizes &lt;strong&gt;universal love, social order, sharing, and honoring the worthy. Equality for all&lt;/strong&gt; is also a major theme in Mohism, which might be why it did not gain much popularity during the dynastic rules of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu believes that as society advances, the balance between &lt;strong&gt;individualism vs. collectivism&lt;/strong&gt; will inevitably tilt in favor of the former. In an advance economy, individuals should dictate terms and politics and become the entirety of politics (by the people and for the people). Therefore, individual rights such as freedom, safety, and private ownership of properties must be protected, and should be the only function of a government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Lu, a modernization of the Chinese culture is just as crucial as the modernization of the Chinese economy. An example he gave was the idea of traditional cardinal human relations, called &lt;strong&gt;Wu Lun (五伦八德)&lt;/strong&gt;. It describes five different sets of relationships and defines the proper societal behavior depends on one’s role in such relationships:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中国传统文化中的人际关系有五伦，君臣、父子、夫妻、朋友、长幼。五伦的文化中，各有自己的道德准则，父子有亲，君臣有义，夫妇有别，长幼有序，朋友有信。五伦基本讲的是熟人之间的关系，所以中国的文化是人情文化。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between the government and citizens (“ruler and subjects”): the government must effectively and intelligently protect the safety of the people and their property, this being the equivalent of the obligation in the olden days of rulers to be “competent rulers”, while the citizens must pay taxes to the government, obey the government’s laws, serve with loyalty and the utmost diligence when recruited or conscripted by by the government, and when appropriate give opinions to the government or try to dissuade the government, these being the equivalent of the obligation in the olden days of subjects to be loyal;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between parents and offspring: parents must raise and educate the offspring, while the offspring must carry out xiao (“be good to parents”) and support and care for aged, weak parents;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between husband and wife: both must be of one heart and mind, and help each other to together build a family life where both the next generation is raised and the previous generation is cared for;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among siblings: older siblings must be kind and helpful to the younger ones, the younger siblings must be respectful to the older ones, and all siblings must help each other;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among friends: friends must help each other, especially with mutual encouragement, mutual advice, and dissuasion from what is wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lu sees a much needed amendment to these five types of relationships as China enters the modern age — a defined way to treat strangers. He believes that by only having these five types of relationships, Chinese society became too much of a GuanXi-oriented society, where &lt;strong&gt;GuanXi&lt;/strong&gt; is often considered above the law. To Lu, rule of law is what defines that relationship among strangers in a shared society with shared ethics, and is crucial to its social order and stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;更严重的是，缺乏陌生人之间的道德准则，是导致商业诚信缺失的重要原因之一，而诚信恰是自由市场经济的润滑剂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More seriously, the lack of ethical standards among strangers is one of the important reasons for the lack of business integrity, and integrity is the lubricant of a free market economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can sum up the idea of value investing into the following four points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mr. Market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock as a piece of a business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin of safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circle of competence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three can be traced back to Ben Graham’s book The Intelligent Investor, the last one was added by his disciples Buffett and Munger. These concepts are so comprehendible that unfortunately, they are often substantially overlooked when people first started investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just that the absence of an objectively sound evaluation system makes the stock market seem to me awfully like a fertile ground for costly, misleading information if not outright fraud. This is where the value of value investors come in, Li argues. With the right tools and intention on their side, value investors are the true price setters of the market and the only reason why the stock exchange around the world are more than a casino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, as Li puts it, that’s what the stock market is there for: to get everyday people’s savings into the right hands in order to raise capital for promising businesses, generate wealth for stakeholders, and invigorate the economy. They search for worthwhile companies like a treasure hunter, and learn about anything related or unrelated to their targets along the way. In Li Lu’s words, ideally a value investor is more of researcher than an investor. Once they confirm their “kill”, sometimes after decades of studying and contemplating, they pull the trigger with unflinching conviction and hold it for a long time. “That’s how I sleep tight at night unlike some of my colleagues”, he reckons. As cool as it may sound, I can’t help but notice the “conscientious bankers” never made it in Hollywood. Too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;mr-market-analogy&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mr-market-analogy&quot; aria-label=&quot;mr market analogy permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mr. Market Analogy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mr. Market analogy is meant to teach us how to differentiate investing and speculating. One can think of the Mr. Market as someone who is extreme, moody, and without much thoughts. The first thing he does every morning is to shout out the latest prices. He does this continuously throughout the day. When he’s optimistic about the future, he acts like an excited auctioneer and frequently adds more to the prices; when he’s depressed, he drastically lowers the prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see Mr Market is a very irrational person. The market operates very much on the two extremes of the spectrum, continuously swinging from peaks to valleys and back again. Most people choose the path of speculation and call themselves traders. It’s the most obvious path, a path that can provide quick riches and fast cash. Most traders attempt to time the market, believing that they are a lot smarter and have a lot more insight than the rest of the traders. Some get lucky and make a lot of money in a short period of time. They feel validated, feeding into their own self-fulfilling prophecy, and believing that they are indeed gods of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value investing fundamentally discourages speculation, and the reasons are simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One can think of market index (ie total stock market index) as a zero sum game, where its value is equivalent to the sum of all investments from both investors and speculators. If the index rises at the same rate as the output from all investors, then the total output of speculators must be 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculators cannot have long term performance due to the point above. If they do better in the short term, what they are doing can be seen as some form of legalized front-running or the murky area of information exploitation or insider information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is also a good judge of character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;市场是一个发现人性弱点的机制，在金融危机到来时尤其如此。只有对知识完全诚实，才可能在市场中生存、发展、壮大。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The market is a mechanism for discovering human weaknesses, especially when the financial crisis comes. Only by being completely honest with knowledge can we survive, develop and grow in the market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham, Buffett, Munger, and Lu love the idea of being an owner of the businesses they invest in, as oppose to a trader (temporary holder). This ownership mentality is important for investors because it urges them to learn more about the business. Naseeb Talib talked about a similar concept in his book &lt;strong&gt;Skin in the Game&lt;/strong&gt;. When an investor sees him/herself as an owner, the risk/reward ratio gets closer to 1 and becomes more balanced. This shift in mentality can also turn the investor into a helper of the business (time in addition to money) and a constructive critic when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin of safety refers to the built-in cushion for downside risk in an investment. As we have established with the Mr. Market analogy above, the market is irrational and can stay irrational much longer than most think. Leaving a big gap between what you pay and what you believe to be the intrinsic value, is therefore recommended in order to stay solvent during the treacherous waves of the market.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle of competence literally means finding the limit to one’s knowledge and ability. Value investors tend to believe that the act of investing should be a reflection of one’s knowledge/wisdom. Hence, the most difficult thing for value investors is to figure out their own limitations and set up boundaries. These boundaries are meant to discipline themselves, so they do not get distracted by the “greener pastures” outside of their circle of competence. The two main questions we should always ask ourselves are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where’s my knowledge border? What area/field of study/industry in which I am truly an expert?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I know that I’m actually competent in this area? How do I know if/when I have achieved true mastery?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very tough questions to answer. When the market moves against you and everyone else is making money while you feel like the only loser in town, how do you maintain your conviction and know that you made the correct bet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu thinks that when searching for your circle of competence, you have to find the smartest person who has the opposing view and be your devil’s advocate. If you are able to convince the other person, then you are closer to the truth and competency. You have to welcome criticism, build a team of people who have opposing views, who can challenge you on your ideas. After all these efforts, when you’ve convinced all the smart people you can find that your idea is superior, it’s still possible that there are blindspots. You will have to spend a lot of time to perfect your logic and knowledge, to be able to better understand the world and predict. Lu encourages investors to think like an economist, a sociologist, and a psychologist — in other words, think broadly and deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the us index market data (1802-1870 -&gt; 6.7%, 1871 - 1925 -&gt; 6.6%, 2000-2012, -0.1%),  even in a prosperous market such as the United States for a long time, the index has performed very poorly in two time periods, and both lasted for more than 10 years, namely 1966-1981 and 2000-2012. Time period, no profit. If someone is unfortunate enough to just put their money in index investing during these two time periods, that’s pretty bad. 10 years is not a short time for a person’s life. If we have not made any profit in the stock market for such a long period of time, our belief basically does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the answer to this question varies from person to person, and if you’re comfortable with the status quo, or self-aware, it’s not bad to accept the returns of the index. But if you want to take it to the next level, learn how to pick stocks and make trading decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value investors are loners who stick to independent thoughts and opinions&lt;/strong&gt;. People who pay less attention to popular trends and opinions are usually better value investors. Lu believes that investors’ circle of competence rarely overlap, so it’s unnecessary to over-communicate. Since value investors aren’t believers in diversification, they would not need to invest in too many ventures. Also, the less time we spend talking with others about the new hot thing, the more time we have to figure out the couple of companies we are researching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value investors are rational and objective&lt;/strong&gt;. People who are less affected by emotions are usually better value investors. There are countless books and articles warning beginner investors about their emotions, leading them to buy and sell at the exact wrong time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value investors are patient&lt;/strong&gt;. Extremely patient. Berkshire is the perfect example of this, where they are willing to sit on a pile of cash for years or decades when they believe that there’s no attractive deals on the market within their circle of competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value investors are also decisive&lt;/strong&gt;. Decisiveness (quickness in action) is often seen as a characteristic that contradicts patience (slowness in action). However, a good value investor must possess both qualities. He or she must be willing to wait for as long as necessary (years) without making a move, but pounce on an opportunity boldly with big wagers when it presents itself (usually during bear market).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value investors are passionate&lt;/strong&gt;. Passion for learning is arguably the most important thing to a fulfilled life. As an investor, having passion for all aspects of business is certainly important as well. Charlie Munger often credits his success and longevity to his interest in money sense — his passion for business in general. He often says that a good investor must also be a good businessman. He or she needs to have a grasp on and curiosity in a business’ operations. This interest will largely guide research in questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes a company successful? Why does it make money?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would the future look like for an industry? What’s its competitive landscape?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research questions usually yield no quick answers. Investment can be seen as a prediction of the future, and the future cannot be predicted most of the time. Therefore, researching for a future prediction is an activity with such low probability of success that one must be content with not finding any answers. Having low expectations, having a scientist’s mindset, and having a healthy relationship with failure and uncertainty are crucial for value investors.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large part of a value investors’ time should be spent reading. Readings should consist of everything and anything, but especially history, business history, and a lot of a company’s annual reports over the years. Munger is famous for being a biography nut. Buffett is known for spending 80% of his waking hours reading. By doing vast amount of reading, research, and analysis, one will have many past predictions formulate in their brain. This type of practice creates a particular smell for good investment that will become second nature for good value investors, helping them make more educated predictions in the future.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you realize that you’ve made a mistake with your evaluation of the company through your research, sell immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you see a better opportunity with better bang for a buck, aka when the opportunity cost is becoming too high&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Valuation becomes too drastic, significantly derailing from the intrinsic value&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value should not be a number, but a range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three characteristics of short selling that people may overlook:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theoretically, a stock can lose 100% of its value, yet the percentage of increase can be infinite. If you short a stock, you have to understand the asymmetric risk you are taking on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best time to short a stock is usually when a company experiences some type of crisis. It can come in the form of a discovery of accounting fraud, insolvency, or otherwise. Oftentimes, fraud can exist for a long time for a company while the market continues to carry the stock forward, and since one must pay interest to short sell, the pressure of short squeeze may bankrupt an investment before the company goes under.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short selling exerts exuberant amount of pressure and occupies all mental capacity of an investor. Lu believes that the confusion and lack of mental clarity short selling creates is actually its deadliest sin. An investor often discount the opportunity cost of the disruption of concentration and sharpness that he/she should always possess. Lu believes that he lost many great investment opportunities during his time of being a short seller because of it.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;真知灼见和频繁交易是互不相容的。这是我最大的错误&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insight and frequent transactions are incompatible with each other. This is my biggest mistake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low interest rate environments are historically rare. However, it is even rarer when all major countries around the world are doing the same QE / low interest rate / central bank interference. If one sees low interest rate as some sort of “discount rate”, then one may be wrong about his/her assessment of their “margin of safety”. The low interest rate environment 1) is usually temporary 2) should be seen as a warning sign, as it does not prevent the economy going further south. In this environment, one should set their margin of safety requirement to be a lot higher, not lower.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a company’s infancy, or during a phase of transition, management is key when it comes to evaluating a company. During a time of normalcy, management hold relatively less importance in the value of a mature company. In china, most companies are still in its infancy, thus it’s more important to consider management as a part of the process of valuation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people start to talk about cycles, they stop being value investors. Nobody who is intellectually honest can predict cycles. When you get into the business of predicting cycles, you will find that besides longer cycles of bubbles, there are infinitely smaller cycles, down to weeks, and days. People fall into the trap of wasting more time chasing cycles than doing actual homework.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between the government and citizens (“ruler and subjects”): the government must effectively and intelligently protect the safety of the people and their property, this being the equivalent of the obligation in the olden days of rulers to be “competent rulers”, while the citizens must pay taxes to the government, obey the government’s laws, serve with loyalty and the utmost diligence when recruited or conscripted by by the government, and when appropriate give opinions to the government or try to dissuade the government, these being the equivalent of the obligation in the olden days of subjects to be loyal;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between parents and offspring: parents must raise and educate the offspring, while the offspring must carry out xiao (“be good to parents”) and support and care for aged, weak parents;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between husband and wife: both must be of one heart and mind, and help each other to together build a family life where both the next generation is raised and the previous generation is cared for;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among siblings: older siblings must be kind and helpful to the younger ones, the younger siblings must be respectful to the older ones, and all siblings must help each other;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among friends: friends must help each other, especially with mutual encouragement, mutual advice, and dissuasion from what is wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More seriously, the lack of ethical standards among strangers is one of the important reasons for the lack of business integrity, and integrity is the lubricant of a free market economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrated Investing profiles eight investors with different investment styles to figure out the principles behind their returns. Was it due to their behavior, the source of capital, the number of investment, or position sizing? The authors answer those questions then look at what the data says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of concentrated investing is simple: most investors are better off owning their top 10 – 15 ideas, instead of spreading money across 50, 100, or 1,000s of ideas, but…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two caveats: (1) Concentrated investing is not for everyone. (2) The book is a roadmap, not a benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lou Simpson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed GEICO’s investment portfolio from 1979 to 2010 averaging a 20.3% return, beating the S&amp;#x26;P 500 by 6.8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was willing it to hold a small number of positions with little turnover, including concentrated sectors bets — multiple stocks from one sector, did M&amp;#x26;A arbitrage, and was willing to hold a cash position absent opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think Independently: Be skeptical, avoid irrational behavior that drives market prices to excess, don’t avoid unpopular companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in shareholder-friendly high-return businesses: uses cash flow as a yardstick, negative free cash flow “chews up owners’ equity,” management owns a sizable stake in the company, is willing to sell off unprofitable operations, and is willing to buy back shares over chasing “less profitable endeavors.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay only a reasonable price, even for an excellent business: “Even the world’s greatest business is not a good investment if the price is too high.” Uses P/E and inverse E/P or earnings yield, and P/FCF as a gauge to value companies. “A helpful comparison is the earnings yield of a company versus the return on a risk-free long-term United States Government obligation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest for the long term: The short term is too unpredictable to guess the swings accurately but would increase transaction costs and taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not diversify excessively: “An investor is not likely to obtain superior results by buying a broad cross-section of the market—the more diversification, the more performance is likely to be average, at best.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often traded around a core position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Maynard Keynes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to the Crash of ’29, Keynes was more of a top-down macro speculator, betting on commodity and currency moves, and doing it on margin. After ’29, he transitioned to more of a concentrated value investor. Though, he continued to use margin in his personal account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynes ran the Chest Fund and a second Fund B for King’s College, as well as advised on the portfolio’s of two Insurance Companies. The Chest Fund earned a 9.12% annual return compared to a UK index of -0.11% over the same period 1928 – 1945.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynes wrote that most investors would never get past the “day-to-day fluctuations in the profits of existing investments, which are obviously of an ephemeral and non-significant character, tend to have an altogether excessive, and even an absurd, influence on the market.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On worrying about certain risks: “some of the things which I vaguely apprehend are, like the end of the world, uninsurable risks and it is useless to worry about them…”  — Keynes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the risk of concentration: “[My] theory of risk is that it is better to take a substantial holding of what one believes in than scatter holdings in fields where he has not the same assurance. But perhaps that is based on the delusion of possessing a worthwhile opinion on the matter.” — Keynes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a diversified portfolio: “The theory of scattering one’s investments over as many fields as possible might be the wisest plan on the assumption of comprehensive ignorance. Very likely that would be the safer assumption to make.” — Keynes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffett on diversification: “If you are a professional and have confidence, then I would advocate lots of concentration. For everyone else, if it’s not your game, participate in total diversification. If it’s your game, diversification doesn’t make sense. It’s crazy to put money in your twentieth choice rather than your first choice.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charlie Munger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlie Munger realized that the biggest problem with most fund types is the ability of clients/partners/shareholders to withdrawal capital at sub-optimal times. Having permanent capital removes that problem, which also helped people like Buffett, Munger, Simpson, Keynes, etc. by not having to think about beating a benchmark or short term returns. Instead, allowing them to maintain a concentrated portfolio with a long term focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger and Buffett found permanent capital via the float of insurance companies and Blue Chip Stamps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger on price: “The desirability of a business with outstanding economic characteristics can be ruined by the price you pay for it. The opposite is not true.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger on concentration: “My own inquiries on that subject were just to assume that I could find a few things, say three, each which had a substantial statistical expectancy of outperforming averages without creating catastrophe. If I could find three of those, what were the chances my pending record wouldn’t be pretty damn good. I just sort of worked that out by iteration. That was my academic study—high school algebra and common sense.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger on where he looked: “I tended to operate, as so many successful value investors do, not looking at Exxon and Royal Dutch and Procter &amp;#x26; Gamble and Coca-Cola. Most of the value investors, if you analyze who’ve been successful over a long time, have operated in less followed stocks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger on companies that bought back stock: “Lou, Warren, and I would always think the average manager diversifying his company with surplus cash that’s been earned more than half the time they’ll screw it up. They’ll pay too high a price and so on. In many cases they’ll buy things where an idiot could see they would have been better to buy their own stock than buy this diversifying investment. And so somebody with that mindset would be naturally drawn to what Jim Gibson used to call “financial cannibals.””&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Rosenfield’s investment principles (as summed up by Jason Zweig):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Do a few things well: Rosenfield built a billion-dollar portfolio not by putting a little bit of money into everything that looked good but by putting lots of money into a few things that looked great. Likewise, if you find a few investments that you understand truly well, buy them by the bucketful.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Sit still: Patience—measured not just in years but in decades—is an investor’s single most powerful weapon.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Invest for a reason: Rosenfield is a living reminder that wealth is a means to an end, not an end in itself. His only child died in 1962, and his wife died in 1977. He has given much of his life and all of his fortune to Grinnell College.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly Criterion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal is to optimize position size for maximum gain while avoiding catastrophic loss, but only when you have an edge. Without an edge, no bet is made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The simplified equation = edge/odds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The purpose of the Kelly Criterion is to maximize the expected value of the logarithm of wealth period by period, but its suggested bets are often very large, and it can be very volatile in the short term. Seeking to avoid the big swings of the Kelly bet, some investors halve the size of the bet recommended by the criterion. This so-called half-Kelly bet achieves three-quarters of the compound return of Kelly with half the volatility. 36 It never pays to bet more than Kelly. Kelly is already the maximal bet for any given edge and odds. Overbetting does not increase the return, but increases the risk to such a degree that it’s likely to reduce growth.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ed Thorp popularized Kelly betting but only recommended fractional-Kelly bets for two reasons: 1) full Kelly bets could produce bigger drawdowns than most could handle, 2) full Kelly bets are likely overestimated due to an underestimated (or error) probability of a catastrophic event (i.e. Black Swans).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorp recognized that Kelly failed to consider the opportunity costs of other positions. He said, “We need to know the other investments currently in the portfolio, any candidates for new investments, and their (joint) properties, in order to find the Kelly optimal fraction for each new investment, along with possible revisions for existing investments.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of a concentrated versus diversified portfolio is the tradeoff between reducing risk through diversity or potentially maximizing returns via concentration. The more diversified you get, taken to an extreme, means a greater likelihood of earning market returns. The more concentrated, taken to an extreme, means a greater likelihood of deviating from the market return but also increases the risks associated with any single stock. So the right number of stocks to own depends on the individual, their skill level, and their ability to handle not only higher volatility that comes with a concentrated portfolio, but permanent losses from any one stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permanent losses are the most important risk to protect against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1977 study, Risk Reduction and Portfolio Size, showed most of the benefits of diversification regarding risk reduction (idiosyncratic risk) was achieved when owning 20 to 30 securities. Owning more produced a minimal increase in benefits. However, the more concentrated portfolios tend to produce a wider range of possible returns that deviate from the market average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Hagstrom, in The Warren Buffett Portfolio, found with portfolio concentration “that reducing the number of stocks in a portfolio increased the chance of generating returns that beat the market. He also found that it increases the chances by the same amount that an investor underperforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors repeated Hagstrom’s study. Using the universe of S&amp;#x26;P 500 stocks, they assembled 1,000 randomly assembled portfolios of each of 250, 100, 50, 30, 25, 20, 15, and 10 stocks. The results show that the average return of each portfolio cluster falls in line with the market average, but the range of possible returns increases as portfolios became more concentrated. So the smaller the portfolio, the more likely its return deviates from the market average. “All that this exercise demonstrates is that concentrating a portfolio improves the chance that the performance of the portfolio deviates from the performance of the underlying index, not that it improves the performance over the underlying index. The expected return of a randomly selected portfolio is still the underlying average. We’re not interested in matching the average. There’s no point attempting to deviate from the market if we don’t intend to outperform it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining a concentrated portfolio with a factor like value, that has shown a history of potential outperformance, increases the chance that the portfolio outperforms the market average in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick O’Shaughnessy shared updated data with the authors from 1964 to 2015: “O’Shaughnessy’s value portfolios ranged in size from as many as 100 stocks to as few as 1 stock. To qualify for selection, each stock needed a minimum market cap of $200 million (inflation adjusted to 2014 dollars). He ranked each stock in the universe on the basis of its fundamental value, defined as an equal weighted combination of its P/E ratio, price-to-sales ratio, enterprise multiple (EBITDA/EV), FCF/EV, and total shareholder yield (its dividend yield plus or minus any shares issued or bought back). Each portfolio was rebalanced on a rolling annual basis to remove any seasonal biases and make the test more robust… O’Shaughnessy found the one-stock portfolios generated the best raw returns at 22.8 percent per year compound. As the number of portfolio holdings swelled from one, the raw returns fell off in rank order. The 25-stock portfolios generated the best Sharpe ratio—a measure of risk-adjusted returns—at 0.85. As the portfolio holdings increased beyond 25 positions, the risk-adjusted returns diminished in rank order. O’Shaughnessy’s research shows that portfolios perform better as they become more concentrated on the most undervalued stocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concentrated portfolio, based on a solid value strategy, only works in the long run, if the investor accepts the likelihood of higher volatility and underperforming the market average in the short run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The right temperament is key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The more broadly a portfolio is diversified, the more likely it is to match the performance of the averages, and the more concentrated a portfolio becomes, the more likely it is to deviate from those averages, either positively or negatively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more concentrated an investor becomes, the greater the portfolio volatility, and performance diverges from the market’s performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.” — Bruce Lee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When times are good, portfolio concentration is popular because it magnifies gains; when times are bad, it’s often abandoned—after the fact—because it magnifies volatility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The singular trait that unites these investors, and separates this group from the herd of investors who try their luck on the stock market is temperament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He believes that a record is built as much on what an investor doesn’t buy, as it is on what he does buy. “We are sort of the polar opposites of a lot of investors,” Simpson said. “We do a lot of thinking and not a lot of acting. A lot of investors do a lot of acting, and not a lot of thinking.” If an investor doesn’t do anything stupid, they can come out well ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I get more and more convinced that the right method in investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which one thinks one knows something about and in the management of which one thoroughly believes. It is a mistake to think that one limits one’s risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence.” — J.M. Keynes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Crucial conversations” are needed when the outcome is important, when people disagree and when emotions are heated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To excel at crucial conversations, you must master the art of engaging in dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To promote effective dialogue, make everyone feel safe expressing what they want to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on what you want to achieve to create a productive dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To elicit more information so you can make better decisions, create a “shared pool” of ideas and understandings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize a crucial conversation by noting certain physical, emotional and behavioural signs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two essential mutual safety conditions for any dialogue are “purpose” and “respect.”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid making someone feel unsafe in a conversation by ensuring that they know you respect them as individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your emotions in a dialogue to stay on task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State what you want, explore what others need, and move on to action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use one of four decision-making methods: “command, consult, vote or consensus.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crucial conversations can often devolve into shouting matches. However, if you learn the right skills, you can master these dialogues and achieve optimal results from them, noticeably improving your personal and professional life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;focus on respect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s okay to ask&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you feel your emotions flaring up, ask the other person if your interpretation of their behaviour is right before freaking out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you understand the subconversations within a difficult conversation, you will be able to manage the issues more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never assume that you understand someone else’s motives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of trying to assign blame, consider how harnessing the associated anger will help you prevent a bad outcome in future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to see the “third story,” the impartial account, rather than fighting over whose story is true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venting your feelings is not useful. Describing them carefully can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t try to control other people’s responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You aren’t perfect, and neither is anyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to get someone to listen to you is to listen to them first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reframing a difficult conversation is a great way to defuse it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick your difficult conversations carefully. You won’t live long enough to have them all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficult conversations are often avoided because you fear the results. The “What Happened?”, Feelings and Identity Conversations can be transformed into Learning Conversations by focusing on curiosity, sharing feelings and refraining from blaming each other. Keeping these things in mind and telling a Third Story will help you and the person you’re talking to have a meaningful conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to your inner voice.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your inner voice is that little sound in your head that remarks on everything you hear, do and read. Sometimes that voice can grow in volume and overpower the voices of others. Instead of muting it, first, listen to it. This way, you’ll discover your true thoughts and train to listen more attentively to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crucial conversations are those everyday interactions that significantly affect your life. They differ from ordinary dialogues because the participants’ opinions vary, their emotions are high, and the stakes are significant. How you deal with these important discussions can have positive or negative results and change the course of your life. Some examples of crucial conversations include breaking up or reconciling with a partner, giving your boss feedback or asking for a pay rise. Often, people shy away from such conversations or handle them poorly. The best way to deal with such situations is to face and handle the conversation skillfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research with more than 20,000 people in hundreds of organizations showed that influential people – those who have successfully achieved their goals and built strong personal and professional relationships – develop an ability to handle crucial conversations effectively. They are skilled in discussing difficult, controversial, high-stakes topics. Cultivating that ability will improve your career prospects, relationships and health. You will increase productivity in your company because you will be better equipped to deal with challenging working relationship topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of mastering crucial conversations is the ability to engage in dialogue. Essentially, this means you can open interaction and converse freely with another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a corporate vice president once had reservations about the CEO’s wish to move to a new location. Others in the firm feared the move but also were afraid to speak up. At a crucial meeting, the VP expressed his concerns in a quiet yet powerfully diplomatic way. The CEO then realized that he had been trying to force his opinion on others and gracefully backed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a successful conversation depends upon the participants providing information and sharing knowledge, sharing information leads to smarter decisions. Even the smartest people are more prone to making mistakes when they don’t have all the necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When two or more people enter a crucial conversation, they don’t share the same thoughts and opinions. Masters of dialogue create an atmosphere where everyone feels safe about adding his or her views to the shared pool of ideas being expressed. Even if someone’s ideas seem wrong, step out of line with prevailing beliefs or provoke controversy, he or she should feel free to articulate them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating this “Pool of Shared Meaning” enables people to make better choices and decisions since they have more accurate, relevant input and information. The process may take time, but the decision will be more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people participate in shaping the meaning of an event, they are more willing to implement its outcome. They act faster and with more commitment. Building this pool of shared meaning by making it safe for others to open up and express themselves is the key to engaging in dialogue in a crucial conversation. Keep your own goals and interests in mind so you can guide the dialogue toward those goals while also considering what others want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, people are more likely to fully commit to solutions resulting from an open dialogue where ideas and information are freely shared. When we see how a solution has been distilled from the available ideas, we’re more likely to be convinced that it’s the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, we tend to resist decisions made without our consultation. We’re more likely to commit to ideas we don’t agree with as long as we can participate in the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-promote-effective-dialogue-make-everyone-feel-safe-in-expressing-what-they-want-to-say&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#to-promote-effective-dialogue-make-everyone-feel-safe-in-expressing-what-they-want-to-say&quot; aria-label=&quot;to promote effective dialogue make everyone feel safe in expressing what they want to say permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To promote effective dialogue, make everyone feel safe in expressing what they want to say.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, how do you master the art of fruitful dialogue? The first step is to “take a long hard look at yourself” and your conversational style. Then “start with the heart.” This means ensuring you engage in a crucial conversation for all the right reasons and concentrating on your goals.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your focus in one of two ways: First, know exactly what you want. This centers your concentration on your goals. When you are engaged in a crucial conversation, you need to ask what you want for yourself, for others and your relationship with the other parties in the discussion. Look to your code, your “North Star,” for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, avoid the “Sucker’s Choice” trap. This occurs when you think you can only choose between two bad options, A and B. However, a better choice, C, is usually available through dialogue if you focus on what you want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent yourself from becoming overly emotional, take a brief moment to focus on what you want to achieve from the dialogue. Ask yourself questions like: What is my aim here? What information do I want to ensure I articulate to my conversational partner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After identifying what you want from the conversation, you can shift your focus to identifying what you don’t want. In other words, what is the one thing you want to avoid in a conversation? You’re liable to want to avoid walking away from it empty-handed ‒ otherwise, you wouldn’t be engaging in a dialogue, to begin with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want to tell your partner something that might upset them, think: What do I want? What do I want to avoid? This simple exercise can help you rationally convey information and keep everyone calm, thus allowing you to say what needs to be said without risking a flying vase to the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To know when a crucial conversation is looming, you must learn to watch out for signs that your discussion is becoming unhealthy. Pay attention to the “content of the conversation” while simultaneously perceiving the “conditions,” such as other participants’ actions, reactions and tone of voice. This pre-emptive protective measure is a form of “social first aid.” To invoke the dialogue process successfully, respond quickly – before emotions mount – to keep it from turning into a casualty case. Avoid engaging in a high-stakes exchange that turns into an argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three key signs will tell you that it is time to act before the conversation becomes a problem:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your discussion involves high stakes, heightened emotions and differing opinions&lt;/strong&gt; – These are sure signs that your conversation is becoming crucial. Look for physical signals, such as your stomach tightening up; for emotional signals, such as feeling scared, hurt or angry; or for behaviour cues, such as raising your voice or pointing your finger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People show signs of feeling unsafe&lt;/strong&gt; – They may become silent or reluctant to speak their minds to protect themselves. Alternatively, they may show signs of aggression, manifesting in name-calling or threatening and domineering behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You feel yourself becoming stressed&lt;/strong&gt; – Take heed if you react silently (by masking your feelings or withdrawing) or violently (by being overly controlling or verbally attacking the person you are speaking to).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people display telltale signs of aggression when they feel unsafe in a conversation. These behaviours can typically be broken down into two categories: silent and violent
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can identify a silent reaction when people start to deliberately hide their opinions in a conversation. A good example is a sarcasm, in which an opinion is deliberately (and obviously) hidden. For instance, someone might tell you, “Wow, what a flattering shirt! No one will ever think it’s three sizes too small for you!”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have an effective dialogue, create an atmosphere where self-expression feels safe for you and the other party. Construct a sense of security when others fall silent or seem to be moving toward anger or violence. Once you see either condition developing, remove yourself from the conversation. Let tensions cool and return to a starting point of mutual concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everyone feels safe again, return to the issue at hand. Two major safety risks can occur, and they require different responses. The first is “mutual purpose,” which can be a casualty of a crucial conversation if others believe you have “malicious intent” or think you want to harm them. Then they won’t trust your motives. In response, look for a united purpose so that others will be willing to listen to your concerns. For example, explain to your boss how his behaviour may hamper productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major safety risk, “mutual respect,” manifests when people sense you are being insolent toward them. As a result, they start to defend their dignity. In response, apologize for any actions that may have shown contempt and emphasize that you respect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this case: A factory employee team has worked through the night to prepare for a site visit from the division vice president. When the VP arrives, he wants to meet with you to discuss the firm’s future rather than conduct a plant tour. You have not communicated this change of plan to the expectant workers, who now have laboured through the night for no reason. When you come face-to-face with them, they irately confront you. “That’s the last time we’re busting our hump for you,” they assert. How should you react? Don’t go on the defensive. Step back and think. Realize that the workers’ anger is a “sign of violated safety.” If you feel mutual intent or respect has gone awry, apologize for the misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinforce your sentiments by using the “contrast technique.” This involves first saying what you did not mean to communicate and then following it up with your intended meaning. For instance, “The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don’t value your work…I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular.” Explain what you want. If you are arguing at cross purposes, use the CRIB technique to frame a mutual purpose: “Commit” to find a mutual purpose, “recognize” an existing purpose or “invent” a new one, and “brainstorm” new approaches and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get annoyed, you are reacting to external events. Therefore, you are making yourself mad, not anybody else. “You and only you create your emotions.” Master your feelings when you are angry, afraid or hurt by following these four steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“See/hear”&lt;/strong&gt; – Start with the facts as you understand them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Tell a story”&lt;/strong&gt; – Explain to yourself what’s happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Feel”&lt;/strong&gt; – Experience certain emotions in response to this knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Act”&lt;/strong&gt; – Take steps based on your feelings and understandings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain complete control over your emotions, retrace this path, one step at a time. Reflect on, question and possibly change one or more elements. Notice the emotions underlying your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examine the stories you tell to determine if your feelings are appropriate and productive. Reconfirm the facts. Recognize your role and motives in creating problems.  Beware especially of three kinds of tales:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Victim sagas”&lt;/strong&gt; – You claim another person is harming you and is at fault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Villain stories”&lt;/strong&gt; – You see the other person as having negative motives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Helpless stories”&lt;/strong&gt; – You depict yourself as unable to resolve a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get what you want, replace stories that trigger negative emotions with stories that provoke positive feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage your emotions by ensuring that you’ve gotten the facts straight before you interpret&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask yourself whether you’re misinterpreting someone’s words whenever you start to feel your emotions flare up. And be sure to separate your explanation from your emotional response so you can stay level-headed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that you have reined in your emotions, you can effectively express your position. Speak to persuade others, but don’t be abrasive, especially when you are involved in controversial or risky discussions. Share your information with confidence, humility and skill. When you are confident, you can speak candidly to say what needs to be said. Humility demonstrates your openness to other people’s opinions, and skill is your ability to speak about touchy subjects with honesty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the “STATE” acronym as a guide in knowing what to say and how: “Share” what you know to be true, “Tell” the story you want to present, “Ask” others to express their stories or paths, “Talk” cautiously and “Encourage” others to speak so you can test the impact your views had on your audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastering crucial conversations also involves listening to others, even when they blow up in anger or shut down in silence. First, ask them to express their point of view. Then (metaphorically), “hold a mirror up to them” to show how you perceive their argument – including body language and tone of voice. Calmly “paraphrase” what you have heard. This creates safety. If you feel the conversation is going nowhere, “prime” the other person into opening up by stating what you believe others may be thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember your ABCs: “Agree” with others where you can, “Build” on what has been said with complete information and “Compare” your path with the other party’s path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make others feel safe in a conversation by creating an atmosphere where they feel their opinions are valued&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start by showing your conversation partner that you care about what’s making them unhappy. Ask them about their motives and, where necessary, confront them on their behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once they start to open up, encourage them to go on by paraphrasing what they’ve said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, however, you might be in a position where you disagree with what your conversation partner tells you. Sometimes, however, you might be in a position where you disagree with what your conversation partner tells you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, turn your conversation into a good decision and mutually accepted united action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do so, choose from these four methods of decision-making:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Command”&lt;/strong&gt; – Allow someone you believe will make a good decision to decide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Consult”&lt;/strong&gt; – Ask others for their input to influence you before you decide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Vote”&lt;/strong&gt; – Agree to whatever most people want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Consensus”&lt;/strong&gt; – Debate the decision until all parties agree on one solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the approach that seems most suitable to the particular situation, so you end up with a clear conclusion. Specify who does what and when. Indicate what follow-up actions you expect. Note the commitments people have made and hold them responsible for their promises.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you ever avoid certain people because you don’t want to have a conversation that you need to have? As you imagine how the conversation might play out, do you feel queasy and apprehensive? This is a normal reaction, but avoiding difficult conversations is not the solution. In fact, often it will make things worse. Yet, experience tells you that having the conversation will create a very uncomfortable situation. You wrestle with different approaches and look for just the right diplomatic language to avoid a confrontation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, certain methods can help you deal with this circumstance. Every conversation has a three-part structure, even if the participants don’t realize that such an underlying framework exists. The structure is built on conversations within the conversation. Understanding these internal conversations can help you avoid the pain of letting difficult talks run their usual course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first part of a conversation is “What Happened?” This section, which is about assigning blame and fault, and asserting dominance, can lead to struggles and bad feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second part is about “Feelings.” Whose feelings are appropriate? Do you have a right to your feelings? Do other people have a right to theirs? Often, the conversation does not specifically address the participants’ feelings, but these emotions inform it, and determine its intensity and course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third part is about “Identity,” which is internal to each person. Are you right or wrong? Are you to blame? Do you deserve love?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the conversation threatens your sense of self, shifting your stance to try to regain your balance is natural, even if it does not help the outcome of the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you experience conflict in the “what happened” part of a conversation, the battle is usually about whose version of the truth is true, who had better intentions and how to assign blame. These ideas are illogical. No one has access to the complete truth. No one can know another’s intentions. Surmising just makes things worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this subconversation, each side is certain that the other side is the problem. Worse still, the participants are sure that the other side’s position has no validity and must be abandoned. In reality, both sides have imperfect understandings of the issues, causes and events involved. If they stop exploring the available information, both sides can learn about the other’s perspective and reach an improved outcome. The key isn’t necessarily to synthesize the positions but to embrace both ideas. Try to change your position to a more complex stance closer to reality. Even when you are certain you are right, remaining open-minded is worthwhile because the conversation is generally not really about the subject you are so sure that you have nailed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t believe that you understand someone else’s intentions. That is a trap. The other person often doesn’t understand his or her actions either. As you reflect on the intentions you ascribe to others, can you see a touch of self-justification in your judgment? Explaining your pure motives is also a mistake. Don’t assume that because the other person now understands that you meant well, the impact of your act no longer matters. You probably know what it is like to have your intentions impugned because someone is angry about the results. The fact that you did not intend your act to harm the other person may teach you a lesson in how to treat others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you are part of a bad situation, you soon realize how you contributed to the mess. You wish you hadn’t, but you did. If you bring the wrong materials to a major presentation, blaming your assistant for packing the wrong stuff is easy, but don’t you deserve some blame, too, for not double and triple-checking everything before such an important event?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isn’t your real goal to ensure this mix-up doesn’t happen again? How will making others feel awful and resentful help you get it right next time? Instead, explore each person’s contribution to the problem and determine what each of you can do to ensure a better outcome in the future. This is not easy when feelings are running high, and the embarrassment is fresh, so wait until you regain control of your emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn the “What Happened” Conversation into a Learning Conversation by focusing on curiosity, impact and contribution.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, try to figure out where your opponent is coming from. Instead of, “How on earth can this person be so irrational?” think, “Wow, this person looks at the same situation and comes to completely different conclusions. I wonder what her perspective looks like. Does she know something I don’t? Or has she considered aspects I’ve not thought of?” This will steer you away from feeling offended and toward genuine interest when someone disagrees with your opinion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, don’t assume the person you’re conversing with has bad intentions. Instead, focus on their actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, stop blaming others and start figuring out everyone’s contribution.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blaming someone else won’t solve anything – it’s a backward-looking tactic that focuses on judgment and incites resentment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, sit down with the other person and try to work through the situation together. Try asking, “How did the two of us contribute to this mess?” followed by, “What can we both do to change the situation and move forward?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficult conversations always involve feelings. That is why they are difficult. People block out their feelings to avoid the discomfort of dealing with raging emotions and heated words. You may fool yourself into thinking you can find an objective emotional space. After all, you see yourself as the unbiased party in this argument, although you may be deceiving yourself. Inevitably, your emotions will break through this wall and compromise your “objectivity.” You will find it almost impossible to listen to the other person until you acknowledge your feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing your emotional patterns is important. Even a good person can have inappropriate and destructive emotions. The other party also has emotions that you need to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to find and comprehend the emotions behind the accusations, blame and judgments. Understand that you can negotiate with your feelings and describe them without giving in to them. Don’t think expressing your feelings is the same as constructively dealing with them. Dealing with emotions often matters most at the end of difficult conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve the Feelings Conversation by exploring, negotiating and sharing your feelings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, let’s find out what’s happening deep down. You can do this by exploring your emotional footprint. This is your way of reacting emotionally, guided by what you consider ok to express and what you believe is better kept to yourself
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself questions such as, “How did you learn to categorize some feelings as inappropriate?” “How did you handle feelings as a child?” and “Did your partner scold you for being ‘needy’ when you craved intimacy?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, you have to negotiate those feelings. Feelings aren’t constant – they change depending on our perceptions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like in the “What Happened?” In conversation, you need to focus on curiosity, impact and contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re constantly arguing with your partner, it might be worthwhile to ask yourself, “Do I make assumptions about his intentions? Do I blame him and ignore my impact?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you address your assumptions, you’ll start to feel differently about the situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last step is to thoughtfully share your feelings – both good and bad –.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you just throw your pent-up emotions at the other person, you’ll make a difficult conversation worse. When correctly expressing yourself, you need to let both the good and the bad out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;sense-of-identity&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#sense-of-identity&quot; aria-label=&quot;sense of identity permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sense of Identity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may avoid difficult conversations because you fear the other party’s response could undermine your sense of self in some critical way. Consider the existence of this fear as you think about the difficult conversations you have avoided in the past. Fear of hearing the other side challenge your competence, deny your sense that you are a good person, or assert that you are unworthy of appreciation or love can lead to paralysis of shattering proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore and understand your complex sense of identity more completely. As you determine how the conversation will affect the other party, realize that his or her identity is similarly complex. Give up trying to control other people’s responses, but prepare yourself for their reactions within various possibilities. If you can admit that you are imperfect, that your intentions are mixed and complicated, and that your actions contributed to the problem, you will have taken a big step toward dealing with your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the intricacies of the Identity Conversation and refrain from controlling others’ reactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you tend to judge yourself in absolute terms: competent or useless, mean or kind, capable or incapable of being loved. Absolute terms such as these are limiting because nothing’s black and white, and as a result, you can quickly get confused about your own identity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, reflect on the fact that your identity comprises many components. Think about the different traits that you deem important – characteristics that you’re proud of and afraid of losing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you figure out which parts of your identity you value the most, you can begin to build complexities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another way to enhance the Identity Conversation is by balancing yourself during the talk. To do so, give up the notion that you can control the other person’s reactions. Abandoning that thought makes it easier to focus and remain on course. You might think that your partner won’t get angry if you say something in a particular way. But the truth is you can never predict these reactions. Once you come to terms with that, unexpected reactions won’t be as unsettling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You simply cannot engage in every difficult conversation that presents itself. You don’t have enough time and most of these confrontations simply aren’t worth the effort. So, how do you pick and choose? No hard and fast rules can help you here. Essentially, you must decide which difficult conversations are worth the trouble for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you consider engaging someone in a difficult conversation, begin with the three sub-conversations – what happened, feelings and identity – and see if your purpose makes sense. If not, don’t pursue it. Ask yourself if the real conflict is personal or if you are trying to solve a temporary problem in a way that will have lingering consequences. Consider alternative methods of dealing with the issue. Perhaps you can do something to relieve the situation that provides a better result than you could get from a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One healthy response is simply to learn to let go. Your duty is to step in with your best efforts, not to make the world a better place. You have limitations, and so does the other party. Don’t make everything personal. It isn’t always about you, who you are or what you have done. Learn the other party’s story. Express (without venting) your view on the situation. Share your feelings by describing – not demonstrating – how you feel. Seek to work with the other party to solve the issue together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-third-story&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-third-story&quot; aria-label=&quot;the third story permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Third Story&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t jump into a difficult conversation with your eyes closed. This will agitate the other party, who will respond with his or her story and attack yours. Nothing gets heard, nothing gets accomplished, and everyone gets upset. Instead, consider both sides and the other side’s story without rejecting it outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine yourself as a third party who has to try to discern what is going on. What you hear as a mediator isn’t either party’s story but a third story. Once someone recounts the third story, each side feels able to step back and explore the other’s account. Now, the participants can share their versions without feeling threatened or antagonistic. As you work through such conversations, notice that they aren’t about who is right or wrong; they are about differing information, priorities and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can make the other person feel heard and understood, you will resolve many issues promptly because listening changes the conversation. Instead of resisting other people, you are affirming them and helping them deal with their concerns. If you practice listening to others – with authentic curiosity – you will learn that it helps others listen to you. If you complain to a professional counsellor that someone won’t listen to you, the counsellor is likely to tell you to listen more so you can be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you know to start a difficult conversation with the third story rather than stating your claims. You know how to get other people to listen by listening to them. Now that you are going to be heard, what do you say? Strive for authenticity rather than eloquence. Believe in your right to speak. If you fail to express yourself, you will not fulfill your objectives for the conversation. However, learning this skill takes time. Do not feel obligated to go beyond your level of comfort. Begin with the core issue, be sure your meaning is clear and don’t circle into the conversation. Don’t state your suppositions as final truths. As you talk about them, offer some context about why you believe them. Avoid language that turns your statements into extreme claims. The more you speak from your core, the stronger your conversation will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is to never start inside your own story. Your perspective is seldom a good starting point. This is because your story could threaten the self-image of the person you’re talking to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Third Story is told from an impartial observer’s view. It points out the difference between the tales of the two parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;everything-works-together&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#everything-works-together&quot; aria-label=&quot;everything works together permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Everything Works Together&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you develop these skills, don’t expect other people to respond to a situation as you would. Leading the conversation is up to you. Try reframing the discussion in various ways until you find a method that allows the other person to hear and participate. Use your listening skills early and often, and don’t give up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes reframing and listening aren’t enough. So try to work on clearing the air by naming the problem keeping you from communicating. This can become a distracting side discussion, but it may be useful if the central conversation has stalled. Once you have an actual on-topic conversation, even if you can’t agree, you can work together to solve problems, discuss options and propose alternatives. Just don’t rush things or demand a quick solution. You’re pursuing a good outcome, not trying to win a race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use these five principles to guide you as you prepare for your next difficult conversation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start your preparation by thinking through the three conversations framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide whether the conversation is necessary by considering your purpose in dealing with the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin the conversation with the third story, not your story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore the other two stories: the other parties and yours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage in problem-solving together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you follow these steps, your difficult conversations may still be challenging, but they will be easier and much more constructive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As the saying goes, ‘Life is just one damn thing after another.’ It is, of course. And now you have some skills to handle it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reframing means taking the essence of what the other person says and translating it into concepts that are more helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Explaining your story is clearly a first step toward being understood. But don’t expect instant success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing wrong with not wanting to hurt someone, or wanting them to like you. Yet holding this as a purpose in the conversation leads to trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Engaging in a difficult conversation without talking about feelings is like staging an opera without the music. You’ll get the plot but miss the point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes what’s difficult about the situation has more to do with what’s going on inside you than what’s going on between you and the other person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how we distort others’ intentions is crucial to untangling what happened between us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delivering a difficult message is like throwing a hand grenade. Coated with sugar, thrown hard or soft, a hand grenade is still going to do damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we jump into conversations we typically begin inside our own story. We describe the problem from our own perspective and trigger just the kinds of reactions we hope to avoid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When disagreement occurs, arguing may seem natural, even reasonable. But it’s not helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The time you spend up front establishing a shared pool of meaning is more than paid for by faster, more committed action later on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Practice doesn’t make perfect; perfect practice makes perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A crucial conversation is a discussion between two or more people where (1) stakes are high, (2) opinions vary and (3) emotions run strong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool – even ideas that at first glance appear controversial, wrong, or at odds with their own beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you know how to handle crucial conversations, you can step up to and effectively hold tough conversations about virtually any topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“In business, you don’t get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Strong relationships, careers, organizations, and communities all draw from the same source of power - the ability to talk openly about high-stakes, emotional, controversial topics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The path to high productivity passes not through a static system, but through face-to-face conversations at all levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the best communities, key individuals and groups find a way to engage in healthy dialogue. They talk through important issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disagreement is not a bad thing, nor does it necessarily lead to a difficult conversation. We disagree with people all the time, and often no one cares very much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our initial purpose for having a difficult conversation is often to prove a point, to give a piece of our mind, or to get others to do what we want. In other words, to deliver a message.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you wake up each day and your &lt;strong&gt;morning routine&lt;/strong&gt; (or lack thereof) dramatically affects your levels of success in every single area of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miracle Morning Life S.A.V.E.R.S.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silence. Start every morning with a period of purposeful Silence of at least 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affirmations. Program yourself to be confident and successful in everything you do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualization. Imagine what you want to achieve and mentally rehearse what you’ll need to do to achieve it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading. Learn from the experts and model successful people who have already achieved what you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scribing. Writing enables you to document your insights as well as any areas of opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to create your affirmations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What You Want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why You Want It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whom You Are Committed To Being To Create It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What You’re Committed To Doing To Attain It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Inspirational Quotes and Philosophies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to visualize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize What You Want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize Who You Need To Be and What You Need To Do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin with the end in mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underline, circle, highlight, and take notes in the margins of books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-read good personal development books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective Journaling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a Journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide what to write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be intentional and aware of what you do every day when it comes to these 12 areas: your attitude, priorities, health, family, thinking, commitment, finances, faith, relationships, generosity, values and growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often want overnight success and want success without paying the price. We think success comes from luck, productivity, recognition, an event, or connections. &lt;strong&gt;But the secret to success is based on what you do every day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the levels of personal, professional, and financial success you desire, you must first dedicate time each day to becoming the person you need to be, one who is qualified and capable of consistently attracting, creating, and sustaining the levels of success you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you wake up each day and your morning routine (or lack thereof) dramatically affects your levels of success in every single area of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miracle Morning is about recreating the experience of waking up feeling energized and excited and doing it every day for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 5-Step Snooze-Proof Wake-Up Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Your Intentions Before Bed. Create genuine excitement for the next morning every night before bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move Your Alarm Clock Across The Room. This forces you to get out of bed and engage your body in movement. Motion creates energy, so when you get up and out of bed, it naturally helps you wake up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brush Your Teeth. Go directly to the bathroom sink to brush your teeth and splash some warm (or cold) water on your face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink a Full Glass of Water. Hydrate yourself first thing every morning. Fill a glass of water the night before, so it’s already there for you in the morning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Dressed or Jump In the Shower. Either get dressed in your exercise clothes so you’re ready to leave your bedroom and immediately engage in your Miracle Morning, or jump in the shower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miracle Morning Bonus Wake-Up Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a timer for your bedroom light. As your alarm goes off, the lights come on in the room. Or turn your light on first thing when your alarm goes off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a timer for your bedroom heater. Keep a bedroom heater on an appliance timer set to go off 15 minutes before waking up, so you’re not tempted to crawl back under the covers to avoid the cold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

S is for Silence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start every morning with a period of purposeful Silence of at least 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activities to choose from and practice during the period of Silence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prayer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Breathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gratitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t stay in bed for this, and preferably leave your bedroom altogether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miracle Morning Meditation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare your mindset and set your expectations. Let go of your stresses and be fully present in this moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit. Sit up straight on the couch, on a chair, on the floor, or sit on a pillow for added comfort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit upright, cross-legged. Close your eyes or can look down at the ground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin by focusing on your breath, taking slow, deep breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth, and be sure to breathe into your belly rather than your chest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, start pacing your breath; in slowly on a count of 3 seconds, hold it in for 3 seconds, and then breathe out slowly on a count of 3 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you attempt to quiet your mind, thoughts will still come in to pay a visit. Simply acknowledge them, then let them go, always returning your focus to your breath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a constant influx of thoughts, it’s helpful to focus on a single word or a phrase and repeat it over and over again to yourself as you inhale and exhale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

A is for Affirmations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use affirmations to start &lt;strong&gt;programming yourself&lt;/strong&gt; to be confident and successful in everything you do. With enough repetition, your subconscious mind will begin to believe what you tell, act upon it, and eventually manifest it in your reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to create your affirmations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Want&lt;/strong&gt;. Begin with clarifying, in writing, what you want—your ideal vision for yourself and your life—in each area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why You Want It&lt;/strong&gt;. Being crystal clear on your deepest whys will give you an unstoppable purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whom You Are Committed To Being To Create It&lt;/strong&gt;. Get clear on who you need to be and are committed to being to take your life, business, health, marriage, etc., to the next level and beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’re Committed To Doing To Attain It&lt;/strong&gt;. Specify the actions you will need to take consistently to make your vision for your ideal life. Include frequency (how often), quantity (how many), and precise time frames (what times you’ll begin and end your activities). Start small and take manageable steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Inspirational Quotes and Philosophies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to upgrade your affirmations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap into your emotions while reading them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate purposeful physiology, such as reciting your affirmations while standing tall, taking deep breaths, making a fist, or exercising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep updating your affirmations. As you continue to learn, grow, and evolve, so should your affirmations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be consistent with reading your daily affirmations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read positive self-improvement books and articles to program your mind with the thoughts and beliefs that will support you in creating success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

V is for Visualization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualization is the process of imagining exactly what you want to achieve or attain and then &lt;strong&gt;mentally rehearsing&lt;/strong&gt; what you’ll need to do to achieve or attain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly after reading your affirmations—where you took the time to articulate and focus on your goals and who you need to be to take your life to the next level—is the prime time to visualize yourself living in alignment with your affirmations. Start with just five minutes of visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Simple Steps For Miracle Morning Visualization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Ready&lt;/strong&gt;. Sit up tall in a comfortable position. Breathe deeply. Close your eyes, clear your mind, and get ready to visualize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualize What You Want&lt;/strong&gt;. See yourself accomplishing what you set out to accomplish and how good it will feel to have followed through and achieved your goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualize Who You Need To Be and What You Need To Do&lt;/strong&gt;. See yourself engaged in the positive actions you’ll need to do each day, and make sure you see yourself enjoying the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morning exercise should be a staple in your daily rituals. Exercising for even a few minutes every morning significantly boosts your energy, enhances your health, improves self-confidence and emotional well-being, and enables you to think better and concentrate longer.&lt;/li&gt;

R is for Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading is one of the most immediate methods for acquiring the knowledge, ideas, and strategies you need to achieve Level 10 success in any area of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to learn from the experts—those who have already done what you want. The fastest way to achieve everything you want is to &lt;strong&gt;model successful people&lt;/strong&gt; who have already achieved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit to reading a &lt;strong&gt;minimum of 10 pages per day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin with the end in mind. Ask yourself why you are reading that book—what you want to gain from it—and keep that outcome in mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use your reading time to catch up on religious texts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underline, circle, highlight, and take notes in the margins of books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-read good personal development books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scribing=Writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing enables you to document your insights, ideas, breakthroughs, realizations, successes, lessons learned, and any areas of opportunity, personal growth, or improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective Journaling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a Format&lt;/strong&gt;. Decide upfront if you want to go with a traditional, physical lined journal or go digital, such as an online journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a Journal&lt;/strong&gt;. Get a nice and durable journal that you enjoy looking at&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide What To Write&lt;/strong&gt;. You can write about your goals, dreams, plans, family, commitments, lessons learned, and anything else that you feel you need to focus on in your life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sit quietly in purposeful silence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read your affirmations out loud from top to bottom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize what it will look and feel like when you reach your goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down some of the things that you’re grateful for, what you’re proud of, and the results you’re committed to creating for that day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a self-help book for 1 minute&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divide the 30-day time frame necessary to implement a positive new habit (or eliminate an old, negative habit) into three 10-day phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Days 1-10] Phase One: Unbearable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first ten days of implementing any new habit, or ridding yourself of any old habit, can feel almost unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these seemingly unbearable first ten days are only “temporary.” It only gets easier from here, and the reward is the ability to create everything you want for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Days 11-20] Phase Two: Uncomfortable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2nd 10-day phase is considerably easier but still requires discipline and commitment on your part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, falling back to your old behaviours will still be tempting. Stay committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Days 21-30] Phase Three: Unstoppable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third 10-day phase is crucial to sustaining your new habit in the long term. The final ten days are when you positively reinforce and associate pleasure with your new habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase Three is also where the actual transformation occurs, as your new habit becomes part of your identity. It transcends the space between something you’re trying and who you’re becoming. You start to see yourself as someone who lives the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success is impossible – So we criticize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success is mystical – So we search for it. (No Quick Fix)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success comes from luck – So we hope for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success is productivity – So we work for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success comes from an opportunity – So we wait for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success comes from leverage -So we power up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success comes from connections – So we network for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success comes from recognition – So we strive for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe success is an event – So we schedule it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret of your success is determined by your daily agenda. You will succeed if you make a few key decisions and then manage them well in your daily agenda. You will never change your life until you change something you do daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. Success doesn’t just suddenly occur one day in someone’s life. For that matter, neither does failure. Each is a process. Every day of your life is merely preparation for the next. What you become is the result of what you do today. In other words …YOU ARE PREPARING FOR SOMETHING.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to change, there are only three kinds of people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who don’t know what to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who know what to do but don’t do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who know what to do and follow-through&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;today is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s too late for yesterday, and we can’t depend on tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 ingredients to make today great: decision and discipline
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most successful people in life are the ones who settle (&lt;strong&gt;make decisions&lt;/strong&gt;) their critical issues early and manage them daily. The earlier you settle the critical issues in your life, the greater your potential for success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discipline: the earlier we start, the greater the compound effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knowing that you’re doing your preparation for the future today gives you the confidence that all will be alright tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick two strength areas and one weakness and work on them for 60 days, then re-evaluate and move on to something new if you have made significant progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the area still needs more work, remain focused for another 60 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never work on more than three at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repeat the process until the daily becomes second nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make your day a masterpiece&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Attitude at the beginning of a task affects its outcome more than anything else. When you approach a task—especially an important one you don’t relish—fix your mind on the facts, not your feelings. Focus on the possibilities, not the problems. That will put your attitude on the right track. And if it starts on the right track, it will likely end up at the right destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Attitude towards others often determines their attitude toward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your attitude is a choice. If you desire to &lt;strong&gt;make your day a masterpiece&lt;/strong&gt;, then you need to have a great attitude. If it’s not good now, you need to change it. Make the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;test your attitude when you spend time with others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do they walk away feeling better or worse?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do you clear the air, giving them a fresh perspective and positive encouragement, or do they go away feeling gloomy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your attitude affects how you start and finish your work. The attitude is contagious, so check to see how others respond to you. If you want a better day, you need to change your attitude. Focus on the possibility instead of the problem. Take responsibility for your attitude, change the bad areas of your attitude and think and talk like the person you want to become. Once you’ve decided to have a positive attitude, it will not take care of itself. You need to attend to it daily by following these disciplines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;begin each day with an attitude check and watch for red flags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize that your attitude needs adjustment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find something positive in everything, even amid difficult situations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate negative words in your vocabulary by saying, “I can, I will, I will make time.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;express gratitude to others daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find positive people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVALUATE PRIORITIES DAILY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities don’t stay put; you must revisit them daily. Why? Because conditions continually change. So do methods of getting things done. Your values, once defined, are going to be steady. You will be able to rely on them. But how you carry them out needs to be flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a survey by Day-Timers, Inc., only one-third of American workers plan their daily schedules. And only 9 percent follow through and complete what they planned.6 If you want to be effective, you must be able to transition to planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you only had six months left to live? What would you do? Priorities are about focus and concentration. It recognizes that time is our most precious commodity, not money. Eliminate the non-essentials. Ask for feedback, take personality tests and evaluate your personal experiences. Think of the Pareto Principle by focusing on the 20% to get an 80% return in life. Priorities help you eliminate the nonessentials in life and leave things undone. Ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is required of me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What gives me the greatest return?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What gives me the greatest reward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set priorities, you need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate priorities daily.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;family life has a profound impact on how you live; it moulds your character and the character of your family members; since your family is the primary environment, it influences the choices to make and the habits you cultivate every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while you can’t do much about your ancestors, you can influence your descendants greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a strong family life, you receive the message that you are loved, cared for, and important. The positive intake of love, affection and respect… gives you inner resources to deal with life more successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family is a haven in a storm. Family can be a source of stability and strength. But we often don’t give them enough of our time. &lt;strong&gt;You can choose how long and how to spend time with them&lt;/strong&gt;. Put your family on your calendar first, and don’t let them have the leftovers in your schedule. Rewrite your definition of success: to be close and care for your family. Make them part of your non-negotiables in your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create and maintain family traditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find ways to spend time together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;express appreciation for each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolve conflict as quickly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success doesn’t come by accident. People don’t repeatedly stumble into achievement and then figure it out afterward. Whether you’re a doctor, a businessperson, a carpenter, a teacher, or a parent, your level of success will increase dramatically if you place a high value on your thinking. The greater your thinking, the greater your potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thinking can increase all value and serve as assets. There are many types of thinking which include: big-picture thinking, focus thinking, creative thinking, realistic thinking, strategic thinking, possibility thinking, reflecting thinking, questioning popular thinking, shared thinking, unselfish thinking and bottom-line thinking. You don’t need to be a master at all the thinking types but simply find people who can compensate for the weak areas. &lt;strong&gt;every day, set aside a certain time to think, find a thinking place and have a system/process that works for you. To think better, you need to&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather good input, capture your thoughts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend time with good thinkers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who desires to achieve and become successful must be like a fine craftsman: committed to excellence. A great craftsman wants you to inspect his work, to look closely at its finest details. In contrast, sloppy people hide their work. And if anyone finds fault with it, shoddy workers find fault with their tools. Which are you most like? Excellence means doing your very best in everything, in every way. That kind of commitment will take you where halfhearted people will never go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, people approach daily commitment in one of two ways. They focus on the external or the internal. Those who focus on the external expect conditions to determine whether they keep their commitments. Because conditions are so transitory, their commitment level changes like the wind. In contrast, people who base their actions on the internal usually focus on their choices. Each choice is a crossroad that will either confirm or compromise their commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect that commitment will be a struggle, but it is worth it. Focus on your choices and stick with them. This requires hard work and dedication. It helps you go when life gets rough, and the pain becomes great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don’t rely on talent alone. Add a strong work ethic to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do what’s right even when you don’t feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognize that money won’t necessarily make you happy. Debt itself will likely make you unhappy as well. And having a financial margin gives you more options. You need to learn how to make money, remain grateful and not compare yourself to others. &lt;em&gt;The author personally lives by this rule: 10% to church and charity, 80% to living expenses and 10% to investments&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;When it comes to financing, ask yourself&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I preoccupied with things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I envious of others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I fight for my values?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I believe money will make me happy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I keep wanting more?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you answered yes to one of these, you need to do soul searching. Materialism is an obsession and mindset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materialism is not about possession—it’s an obsession. I’ve known materialistic people with no money and nonmaterialistic people who possess lots of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;money is nothing but a tool that gives you options&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus on your financial game plan so that you have more, not fewer, options to earn every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;become a good earner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t compare yourself to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give as much as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be grateful for what you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;faith is trusting in advance what will only make sense in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives strength and reduces stress. Studies have shown that people with faith are less likely to fall ill than non-believers. Everyone has faith, including both religious people and Atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace the value of faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore and deepen faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;associate with people of faith&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith not only can help you through a crisis, but it can also help you to approach life after the hard times with a whole new perspective. It can help you adopt an outlook of hope and courage through faith to face reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, many people hoped that science would provide all the answers to life’s questions. But science cannot do that. Ironically, what is embraced as scientific fact changes from generation to generation? Just look at the way scientists have viewed our solar system. Ptolemy believed the earth was at its center. Copernicus asserted that the sun was at its center, and the planets moved in circular orbits around it. Kepler proved that the orbits were elliptical. Today, scientists no longer argue about the solar system’s structure, but ideas about how it was formed change continually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people give away their relational energy on a first-come, first-served basis. Whoever gets their attention first gobbles up their time and relational energy. That’s why the squeaky wheels instead of the high producers at work consume so much attention and why so many people have nothing left to give when they get home from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people don’t like you… they’ll try to hurt you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they can’t hurt you… they won’t help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they have to help you… they won’t hope you succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they hope you don’t succeed… life’s victories feel hollow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you desire to improve your understanding of people so that you can build positive relationships, then keep in mind the following truths about people—and actions you can take to bridge the gap often caused by them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are insecure … give them confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People want to feel special … sincerely compliment them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People desire a better tomorrow … show them hope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People need to be understood … listen to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are selfish … speak to their needs first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People get emotionally low … encourage them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People want to be associated with success … help them win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will get far in life if you like people because the likable person always wins. Refer to “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie. Place a high value on people, expect the best from them, learn to understand them, listen to people, compliment them, listen to them, speak to their needs and encourage them to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give respect freely but expect to earn it from others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add value to others without expect to receive value in return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;express love and appreciation often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t carry emotional baggage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True generosity isn’t a function of income—it begins with the heart. It’s about serving others and looking for ways to add value to them. That’s the way to achieve significance in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love givers rather than self-centred people. Giving turns your focus outward, adds value to others and helps the giver. You usually feel good after giving. So give others your money, time, and energy. Make yourself valuable but also value others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the purpose of life is not to win but to grow and share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to plan for and model generosity daily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t wait for prosperity to become generous; change your heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a reason to give every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find people to receive every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discrepancies between values and practices create chaos in a person’s life. If you talk about your values but neglect to walk them, then you will continually undermine your integrity and credibility. And that will happen even if you are unaware of your behaviour and are not doing it intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values serve as an anchor, faithful friend and your north star. Many things in life will stand in the way of your values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every day, reflect and review your values&lt;/strong&gt;. Articulate and embrace your values every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See how you can apply and practice your values&lt;/strong&gt;. Compare your values to your practices daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;live out your values regardless of your feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;values are the principles that guide your life. Your values are the deeply held beliefs that authentically describe your soul. They become a companion to you throughout your life and don’t change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the most difficult part of the upward growth climb is putting into practice what you learn. Yet that is where the true value is. The final test of any learning is always application. If what you’re learning can be used to help and improve you or others, then it is worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think our bodies and minds will take care of themselves automatically. We also think knowledge, information and experience are signs of growth. &lt;strong&gt;But it’s about reflecting on the experience and applying the knowledge learned&lt;/strong&gt;. This prevents stagnation in life. We also need to focus on internal change rather than external change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop and follow a personal growth plan&lt;/strong&gt; by setting growth goals and putting yourself in an environment that supports growth. Keep asking yourself: &lt;strong&gt;“what is my potential?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document what you learn and apply it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn to enjoy the journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People without values are adrift on the ocean of life. When the waves come crashing down, they have no place to rest. Any big storm can threaten to put them under. Any current is liable to take them places they don’t want to go. However, when you have strong values, you have something that holds you steady, even when the weather gets nasty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Methods are many, Values are few. Methods always change, Values never do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, 2.5 percent of our income goes to charitable giving. That’s lower than it was during the Great Depression (2.9 percent). And 80 percent of Americans who earn at least $1 million a year leave nothing to charity in their wills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greatness is not defined by what a person receives, but by what that person gives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of home and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand.” – U.S. President Woodrow Wilson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have one true friend in life, you are very fortunate. If you have two real friends, it is highly unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Faith is to believe what we do not see; and the reward of this faith is to see what we believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A faith that hasn’t been tested can’t be trusted”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having money may not make people happy, but owing money is sure to make them miserable”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you owe $1,000, you’re a piker. If you owe $100,000, you’re a businessman. If you owe $1 million, you’re a tycoon. If you owe $1 billion, you’re a magnate. If you owe $100 billion, you’re the government.” – Rose Sand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing is easier than saying words. Nothing is harder than living them, day after day. What you promise today must be renewed and redecided tomorrow and each day that stretches out before you.” –  Arthur Gordon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time a person puts an idea across, he finds ten people who thought about it before he did—but they only thought about it.” Ideas, put into action, give an advantage.” – Alfred Montapert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before going to War—pray once. Before going to Sea—pray twice. Before getting Married—pray three times.” – Russian Proverb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Besides the noble art of getting things done, there is the noble art of leaving things undone. The wisdom of life consists of the elimination of nonessentials.” – Lin Yutang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Guard well your spare moments. They are like uncut diamonds. Discard them and their value will never be known. Improve them and they will become the brightest gems in a useful life.” British prime minister William Gladstone said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is a wise man who wastes no energy on pursuits for which he is not fitted; and he is wiser still who from among the things he can do well, chooses and resolutely follows the best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.” – “John Wooden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All things being equal, attitude wins. All things not being equal, attitude sometimes still wins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his time when it comes.” -Benjamin Disraeli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How you wake up each day and your morning routine (or lack thereof) dramatically affects your levels of success in every single area of your life”.
“By simply changing the way you wake up in the morning, you can transform any area of your life, faster than you ever thought possible”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every day you and I wake up, we face the same universal challenge: to overcome mediocrity and live to our full potential”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always remember that where you are is a result of who you were, but where you go depends entirely on who you choose to be, from this moment on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must realize that the real impact and consequence of each of our choices and actions—and even our thoughts—is monumental, because every single thought, choice, and action is determining who we are becoming, which will ultimately determine the quality of our lives. As T. Harv Eker said in his best-selling book Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, ‘How you do anything is how you do everything’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time you choose to do the easy thing, instead of the right thing, you are shaping your identity, becoming the type of person who does what’s easy, rather than what’s right”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you do choose to do the right thing and follow through with your commitments—especially when you don’t feel like it—you are developing the extraordinary discipline (which most people never develop) necessary for creating extraordinary results in your life.  As my good friend, Peter Voogd, often teaches his clients: ‘Discipline creates lifestyle’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the alarm clock goes off, and we hit the snooze button (the easy thing), most people mistakenly assume that this action is only affecting that moment. The reality is that this type of action is programming our subconscious mind with the instructions that it is okay for us to not follow through with the things we intended to do”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always remember that who you’re becoming is far more important than what you’re doing, and yet it is what you’re doing that is determining who you’re becoming”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Virtually all highly successful people—from CEOs to professional athletes to the President of the United States—embrace a high degree of accountability”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Accountability is the act of being responsible to someone else for some action or result”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here’s the problem: accountability was never something you and I asked for, but rather something that we endured as children, teens, and young adults. As it was forced upon us by adults, most of us unconsciously grew to resist and resent accountability altogether”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our levels of success will rarely exceed our level of personal development, because success is something we attract by who we become”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Remember this truth: now matters more than any other time in your life, because it’s what you are doing today that is determining who you’re becoming, and who you’re becoming will always determine the quality and direction of your life”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time you hit the snooze button, you’re in a state of resistance to your day, to your life, and to waking up and creating the life you say you want”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been said that nobody actually likes waking up early, but everyone loves the feeling of having woken up early.The first key to waking up is to remember [to set your intentions before bed]: Your first thought in the morning is usually the last thought you had before you went to bed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you keep your alarm clock next to your bed, then you are still in a partial sleep-state when the alarm goes off, and it makes it much more difficult to wake yourself up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s crucial that you hydrate yourself first thing every morning. After 6-8 hours without water, you’ll naturally be mildly dehydrated, and dehydration causes fatigue”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Graham knew that stocks typically look most attractive at the top of their business cycle (the worst risk-reward ratio) and least attractive at the bottom (the best risk-reward ratio).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Icahn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ichan started in convertible arbitrage, moved into closed-end mutual fund arbitrage, and eventually to activist investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He outlined the transition to an activist investor in a 1976 memo “Icahn Manifesto.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal was to motivate management to act in the shareholder’s best interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible outcomes produce profits: liquidation or sale to another company, making a tender offer, proxy fight, or selling stock back to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Graham was an early activist who saw firsthand how often management ran a business for themselves and at the expense of shareholders. Most shareholders never questioned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham’s NCAV was a conservative estimate of liquidation value (a worst-case scenario) for a stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin of Safety: protects from permanent loss and provides an opportunity for gain as price rises closer to value. The wider the spread between price and value the wider the margin of safety (lower the risk) and the higher the possibility for gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing Graham’s NCAV strategy: NCAV stocks were divided into stocks that were profitable in the prior year and stocks operating at a loss. The portfolio of stocks operating at a loss outperformed the profitable stocks. And the profitable-dividend paying stocks earned a lower return than non-dividend payers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCAV strategy is very limited — usually, very small companies and the opportunities only appear in a bear market and disappear entirely in long bull markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth Klarman looks for catalysts to reduce risk and generate returns because catalysts reduce the impact market fluctuations might have on a stock’s price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Munger believed some companies were worth paying a premium for: “The trick is to get more quality than you pay for in price. It’s just that simple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See’s Candies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett paid $25 million for the company in 1972.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1971, See’s earned $5 million pre-tax on $8 million in tangible assets; a 60% return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10% to 12% discount rate put the value of See’s between $40 and $48 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett called See’s the “prototype of a dream business.” It requires very little capital to operate the business and generates a huge return on capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 2007 BRK letter, Buffett explained why: from 1972 to 2007 earnings grew 16-fold while invested capital grew 5-fold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Greenblatt’s “Magic Formula” ranks stocks based on quality and value using: return on capital and earnings yield where earnings yield = EBIT/EV. From 1974 to 2011, the Magic Formula earned a 13.94% annual return versus the S&amp;#x26;P 500’s 10.37%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Yield (EBIT/EV) alone earned 15.95% annually from 1974 to 2011, beating the market and Greenblatt’s Magic Formula. Return on capital alone underperformed the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low valuation ratio is more likely to identify an undervalued stock than a high valuation ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1964 to 2011: EBITDA/EV, EBIT/EV, P/E, EV/FCF, EV/Gross Profit, P/B outperformed the S&amp;#x26;P 500 (total return). The top three metrics were EBIT/EV, EBITDA/EV, and EV/Gross Profit, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EV = market cap plus debt and preferred stock minus cash. It’s a closer measure of a company’s true cost to an acquirer because an acquirer assumes all the liabilities but gains cash and equivalents after a takeover. Market cap can be misleading, especially for highly levered or cash-heavy companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should be thinking in similar terms as an acquirer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean Reversion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few businesses produce persistently high returns on capital but most don’t. Predicting which businesses do is not easily measurable via quantitative factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most businesses that earn high returns on capital eventually see those returns revert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High returns on invested capital attract competition and investment that eventually lowers returns across the industry. In the rare cases where high returns persist, it’s larger due to protection from competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk of ignoring the possibility of mean reversion is overly-optimistic valuations that lead to losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;De Bondt and Thaler tested two portfolios of stocks: the 35 extreme winners against the 35 extreme losers from 1926 to 1982 and found the losers beat the winners. They theorized the performance was due to investors overreacting to news — too pessimistic or optimistic — in the short term. In a second study, they tested mean reversion in earnings — earnings of stocks in the loser portfolio grew faster than in the winner portfolio (the winners saw earnings decrease).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dimson, Marsh, &amp;#x26; Staunton found an inverse relationship between investment returns and GDP growth per capita. In a second study, country’s with economies with the lowest growth rate produced the highest stock market returns. Investors see high growth in an economy, become optimistic, and bid stock prices too high. The opposite happens with low growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lakonishok found that value stocks beat glamour stocks because “naive” strategies failed to account for mean reversion. The authors replicated Lakonishok’s study in 23 developed countries and found similar results — value outperformers glamour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The characteristics behind mean reversion in markets is behavioral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kahneman &amp;#x26; Tversky found that people make decisions based on three heuristics — representativeness, availability, and anchoring/adjusting — that lead to mistakes. It causes people to ignore the probabilities of future events when making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three variables in discounted cash flow models — future cash flows, growth rate, and discount rate — are potential sources of error. Being wrong on one can throw the entire model off. Minor changes in the discount rate have the biggest impact. More importantly, the model creates the impression that accurately predicting future cash flows and growth is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contrarian investor should anticipate mean reversion in fundamentals and valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrarian Value Portfolio versus Glamour Portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrarian Value portfolio held stocks with the lowest sales growth and lowest P/B, P/CF, and earnings multiple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glamour portfolio held stocks with the highest sales growth and highest P/B, P/CF, and earnings multiple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study was run from 1963 to 1990.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrarian Value significantly outperformed Glamour over 5 year periods with a cumulative return ranging from 77% to 104% depending on the valuation multiple used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to selection in the portfolio, glamour showed the highest growth in earnings, cash flow, sales, and operating earnings and contrarian value showed the lowest growth in earnings, cash flow, sales, and operating earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrarian Value versus High-Growth Value
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up similarly to prior study but with the value decile split between high and low growth (contrarian) earning, cash flow, sales, and operating earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrarian  Value significantly outperformed High Growth Value (high growth value outperformed glamour).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two takeaways: value may be more important than growth and low/no growth leads to outperformance while high growth leads to underperformance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golden Rule of Predictive Modeling: simple models often make as/more reliable predictions than experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies on activist campaigns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activist campaigns against companies produce both short and long-term outperformance in the stock’s price versus the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Campaigns specific to seeking the sale of the company or a spinoff of assets produced the highest excess returns, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activist campaigns also outperform a basket of cheap stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more hostile or aggressive campaigns earned a higher return, on average, than friendlier campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies hit by activist campaigns show an improvement in fundamentals — improved margins, ROA, ROE, payout ratio, and lowered executive pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The typical activist target was undervalued, with high cash flows but low payouts, large cash holdings compared to other assets, and poor growth prospects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typical activist’s primary objective was to fix one of these categories: undervaluation, operational efficiency, low payout and overcapitalization, excessive diversification, independence, poor governance, and undercapitalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basket of the cheapest of the cheap value stocks outperformed all. The cheapest EBIT/EV decile, split between Deep Value (lowest value) and Glamour (highest value), and versus the entire decile, Deep Value beat all from 1951 to 2013. And equal-weighted Deep Value outperformed market-cap-weighted Deep Value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This book is an investigation of the evidence, and the conditions under which losing stocks become asymmetric opportunities, with limited downside and enormous upside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors aren’t rewarded for picking winners; they’re rewarded for uncovering mispricings — divergences between the price of a security and its intrinsic value. It is mispricings that create market-beating opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whenever a fight for control is initiated, it generally leads to windfall profits for shareholders. Often the target company, if seriously threatened, will seek another, more friendly enterprise, generally known as a ‘white knight’ to make a higher bid, thereby starting a bidding war. Another gambit occasionally used by the target company is to attempt to purchase the acquirers’ stock or, if all else fails, the target may offer to liquidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly enough, although I consider myself to be primarily in the quantitative school…the really sensational ideas I have had over the years have been heavily weighted toward the qualitative side where I have had a “high-probability insight.” This is what causes the cash register to sing. However, it is an infrequent occurrence, as insights usually are, and, of course, no insight is required on the quantitative side—the figures should hit you over the head with a baseball bat.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The data suggest that the better bet is fair companies at wonderful prices. The why of it reveals two truths about value investment: First, Greenblatt’s earnings yield is a very good metric for identifying undervalued stocks, and, second, mean reversion is a powerful phenomenon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Abnormally good or abnormally bad conditions do not last forever. This is true of general business but of particular industries as well. Corrective forces are usually set in motion which tend to restore profits where they have disappeared, or to reduce them where they are excessive in relation to capital.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is impossible to infer the cause of persistence in performance from the fact that persistence occurs. Persistence may be due to fixed resources, consistent industry structure, financial anomalies, price controls, or many other factors that endure… In sum, reliable inferences about the cause of persistence cannot be generated from an analysis that only documents whether or not persistence occurred.” — Michael Porter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here is the simple truth: mean reversion is pervasive, and it works on financial results as it does on stock prices. On average, super-normal returns on capital revert to the mean. Only special cases avoid mean reversion, and the factors that separate the also-rans from the special cases are impossible to identify prospectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A company with great fundamental performance may earn a market rate of return if the stock price already reflects the fundamentals. You don’t get paid for picking winners; you get paid for unearthing mispricings. Failure to distinguish between fundamentals and expectations is common in the investment business.” — Michael Mauboussin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mean reversion in the markets looks a lot more like the gambler’s fallacy made real — movements in security prices, individually and in aggregate, tend to be followed by subsequent price movements in the opposite direction. The more extreme the initial price movement, the greater will be the subsequent adjustment in the opposite direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Graham’s deeper lesson was that value oscillates, too. We err when we examine a stock’s financial statements to analyze its fundamental performance and assume that the trend will persist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny’s findings suggest that a contrarian strategy—one that actively seeks out undervalued companies with poor historical performance—will outperform overvalued companies with excellent historical performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the High-Growth Value and Contrarian Value portfolios contained stocks trading on approximately the same price-to-value ratios, the stocks in the High-Growth Value portfolios were in some instances cheaper than the stocks in the Contrarian Value portfolios and yet the Contrarian Value portfolios delivered comprehensively better returns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is clear is that value investing in general, and deep value investing in particular, is exceedingly behaviorally difficult. It is counterintuitive and against instinct, which is why many investors shy away from it. To succeed as deep value investors, we need to overcome our behavioral biases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any investment strategy that is based upon buying well-run, good companies and expecting the growth in earnings in these companies to carry prices higher is dangerous, since it ignores the possibility that the current price of the company already reflects the quality of the management and the firm. If the current price is right (and the market is paying a premium for quality), the biggest danger is that the firm loses its luster over time, and that the premium paid will dissipate. If the market is exaggerating the value of the firm, this strategy can lead to poor returns even if the firm delivers its expected growth. It is only when markets under estimate the value of firm quality that this strategy stands a chance of making excess returns.” — Aswath Damodaran&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the long haul, the market reflects management’s ability to make the most out of its assets. So the price of a company’s stock is like a report card… A going concern should sell for at least the value of its assets, and something more if it has good management. If a company has poor management, the price of the stock will suffer, usually selling substantially below the appraised value.” — T. Boone Pickens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where the company is not appropriately capitalized, where it is not minimizing its cost of capital, intrinsic value can be improved by reducing excess cash. In so doing, the market price discount is also likely to be removed, and the company trade closer to its fully realized intrinsic value. The utility of the enterprise multiple is that it identifies precisely this type of company, undervalued with an unexploited intrinsic value. If no activist emerges to improve the unexploited intrinsic value, other corrective forces act on the market price to generate excellent returns in the meantime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The research shows, first, that valuation is more important than the trend in earnings. Cheap, low, or no-growth portfolios systematically outperform expensive, high-growth portfolios, and by wide margins. The second, more counterintuitive finding of the research is that, even in the value portfolios, high growth leads to underperformance, and low or no growth leads to outperformance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide digs into the growing factor zoo to find the factor premia worth considering in a portfolio. The authors introduce five criteria any factor should meet, discuss the seven factors that qualify, and why other factors fall short of consideration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data mining often finds false factors that result from randomness. Data mining has created a growing “factor zoo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always a risk that a factor has been arbitraged out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities and timberland are the only two alternative investments with no correlation to stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factor diversification is a more effective diversifier than asset class diversification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factor Investability Test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent – factor delivers historically reliable returns across time and economic regimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pervasive – factor delivers returns across different asset classes, sectors, and countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robust – factor delivers returns across various metrics versus only one metric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intuitive – factor makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investable – factor delivers returns not only on paper but in reality, after fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To earn the premium of any factor investors must accept the risk of long periods where the premium is negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Beta Premium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beta is the amount an asset moves relative to the market or the correlation between the asset’s returns and the market’s returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market beta premium in the U.S. is 8.3% (1927 to 2015). It’s the excess returns stocks earn over T-bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been positive in almost every country since 1900, ranging from 3.1% to 6.3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Size Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size Premium – small-cap returns minus large cap returns or small minus big (SMB). Small and large caps are divided by deciles. Small is deciles 6 to 10. Large is deciles 1 to 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size Premium in the U.S. is 3.3% (1927 to 2015).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also persists in developed (ex-US) and emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the size premium is constructed using the smallest 30% versus the largest 30%, the premium increases. As the definition of small vs. large is narrowed (i.e. smallest 20%, 10%, etc.), the premium increases further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small Companies typically carry: more leverage, smaller capital base, more volatile earnings, lower profitability, uncertain cash flows, less liquidity, unproven track record, unproven management, more volatile stock prices, and investors favor stocks with potential lottery-like returns. All are possible risks that explain the premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monetary policy affects the size premium. The premium shows up during periods of expansionary policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size premium varies across the economic cycle. Small companies grow faster than large companies during economic upturns but do worse during downturns. Small caps produce low returns during recessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small Cap Growth is the exception, underperforming the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size works better with other factors: value, momentum, quality, and low-beta all showed improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value Premium – value stock returns minus growth stock returns or high minus low (HML). Growth is defined as the 30% of stocks with the highest book-to-market ratio. Value is the 30% of stocks with the lowest book-to-market ratio. Book-to-market is the common metric used by academics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists across developed and emerging countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns were higher in value stocks that had cut dividends by 25% or more, high debt-to-equity ratio, and high earnings volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk-based explanations: value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks during falling interest rates, increases in money supply, and economic expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavioral-based explanations: investors are too optimistic of growth stock performance and too pessimistic toward value stocks or investors confuse popularity with safety, leading to growth stock becoming overvalued and value stocks being undervalued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value premium may persist beyond one year — up to three years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Momentum Premium: assets that have performed well in the recent past will continue to perform well in the future. Defined as returns over the last 12 months (excluding the most recent month) or up minus down (UMD) The most recent month is usually excluded because it tends to show a reversal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Momentum Premium in the U.S. is 9.6% (1927 to 2015).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two Types:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-Sectional Momentum: measures the relative performance of an asset versus other assets in the same asset class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time-Series Momentum: aka trend-following measures the absolute performance of an asset versus its own performance (covered below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists across asset stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and county.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s strongest in small caps, especially microcaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Momentum tends to be a high turnover strategy, which can increase trading costs. To avoid high turnover, momentum can be used to filter out assets to avoid, lowering turnover. Works well in combination with a value factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 52% of the premium comes from the long side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavioral Explanation: Investors are slow to react to new information (underreaction) and then chase returns (overreaction).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Momentum returns fall from 8.9% to 2.9% over a six-month period, for stocks with continuous information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The premium exists in other periods – 6 and 9 months, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long/Short momentum strategies experience crashes on the short side (due to quick market reversals) during periods of higher volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The way to mitigate the risk of crashes is to vary exposure to momentum over time. The authors found that if they scaled exposure to momentum (using the realized variance of the daily returns in the previous six months), the risk-managed momentum strategy achieves a higher cumulative return with less risk.” It adjusts the amount of money invested based on volatility because volatility typically rises prior to drawdowns. Less (more) money when volatility is high (low).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, diversifying across factors can lower the risk of momentum crashes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profitability &amp;#x26; Quality Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quality and Profitability factors are broad with a lot of metrics lumped into each that meet the investability test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitability Factor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross Profitability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitable companies generate higher returns than unprofitable companies, with the most profitable outperforming the least profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shows a similar predictive power as book-to-market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictor of future growth, earnings, free cash flow, and payouts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High asset turnover drives returns of profitable companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High gross margins drives returns of “good” growth stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash-based Operating Profitability (excluding accruals): Tends to outperform other profitability metrics: operating profitability, gross profitability, and net income-based profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on Equity: high ROE companies outperform low ROE companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on Invested Capital: high ROIC companies outperform low ROIC companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Profitable Premium increases during economic drawdowns because profitable companies perform better than unprofitable companies during recessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral Explanation: investors underreact to profitability news, leaving those companies undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combines well with value strategies, tends to be low turnover, and reduces volatility. Tends to perform better when value performs poorly. A value/profitability combo never experienced a losing five-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Profits/Assets, Total Profits/Sales, and FCF/Assets also show a premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality Factor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defined as quality minus junk (QMJ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combines well with value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Shares Issued: Companies that decrease net shares outperform companies that increase net shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accruals: Companies with low accruals outperform companies with high accruals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Operating Assets: “The difference on a firm’s balance sheet between all operating assets and all operating liabilities, scaled by total assets, is a strong negative predictor of long-run stock returns.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset Growth: Companies with high asset growth underperform companies with low asset growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment/Assets: Companies with high capital investment-to-assets underperform companies with low capital investment-to-assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distress: Companies with a high chance of failure underperform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on Assets: More profitable firms outperform less profitable firms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohlson O-Score: Measures risk of bankruptcy. High bankruptcy risk leads to underperformance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital Investment: Companies that increase capital investment underperform those that don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Term Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Term Premium is the long government bonds minus 1-month T-bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The premium is 2.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent globally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer maturity = higher premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carry Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry Premium is defined as higher-yielding assets outperform lower-yielding assets assuming prices do not change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ex: currencies of the highest interest rate countries outperform currencies of the lowest interest rate countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists across asset classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry trade strategies have a risk of crashes when stock markets crash. Lower interest rate currencies act as “safe havens” during global shocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combining carry and trend following produces a better return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows factor premia declined less, after publication, in stocks that are more costly to arbitrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is less evidence of factor premia decline, after publication, internationally due to arbitrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limits to Arbitrage: Why Anomalies Might Persist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions are prohibited by their charters from shorting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of shorting is too expensive and/or limited supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of shorting (unlimited loss) is too high, forced liquidation, or recalled stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading costs and taxes can also limit arbitrage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career Risk: Fund managers are unwilling to stray too far from their benchmark for fear of losing their job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking Error: the risk of underperforming a benchmark. It can lead to investors confusing strategy and outcome and abandoning a solid strategy at inopportune times. A strategy should be judged on its face before the results because outcomes are not guaranteed in investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relativism: the tendency for investors to compare their performance against a benchmark (or others), which affects their satisfaction with the strategy and their willingness to stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recency Bias: recent events have a larger impact on a person’s thoughts and decisions. It lead investors to put too much weight on recent events like performance and buy what has recently performed well while selling what has recently performed poorly — when they should be doing the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research shows that dividend yield alone does not predict future returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns of dividend strategies are better explained by exposure to other factors. For example, strategies based on companies with rising dividends are better explained by quality and profitability factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, dividends do provide psychological benefits — receiving dividends avoids regret from selling stock and the effect of loss aversion. “People suffer more regret when actions are taken than when actions are avoided. In selling stock to create the homemade dividend, a decision must be made to raise the cash. When spending comes from the dividend, no action is taken, thus less regret is felt. Again, this helps explain the preference for cash dividends.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend yield combined with net share buybacks and debt reduction does improve returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with a lower payout ratio outperform those with a higher payout ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low Volatility Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Volatility Factor is that defensive less volatile stocks outperform aggressive, high volatile stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists in developed and emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Vol factor may be better explained by profitability and size (large caps).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A combination of a highly volatile stocks and low short interest outperformed a market index by 7%. A combo of highly volatile stocks and high short interest underperformed. In fact, high volatility/low short interest outperformed during prior crashes in 2000 and 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short Interest — stocks with high short interest perform poorly on average. Stocks with high borrowing costs also predict poor returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-vol strategies are exposed to term risk — more correlated with long-term bond returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-vol strategies tend to shift exposure between growth and value regime — spending about 62% of the time in value regimes, 38% in growth regimes. Most of the outperformance can be explained by its time in the value regime as it underperforms in the growth regime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-vol factor is predictive of future low volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One way to take advantage of the low-vol factor is to screen out high volatile or high beta stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default Factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default Premium is long-term investment grade bonds minus long-term government bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source of the premium is explained by default/credit risk. However, taking additional credit risk offers an almost insignificant additional return over government bonds, historically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the return of high-yield bonds is explained by equity risk. High-yield bonds are also highly correlated with stocks, especially when stocks perform poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long term, the correlation between Treasuries and stocks is nearly 0 (uncorrelated), but that correlation varies over time. Bonds are negatively correlated when stock volatility rises. During stock market drawdowns investors flee to safe government bonds. So Treasury bonds are a strong diversifier for stocks during drawdowns. Other bonds do not carry the same diversification benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-Series Momentum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time-Series Momentum is the trend of an asset compared to its own past performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persists internationally and across other asset classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not experience crashes like cross-sectional momentum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual Momentum — combines time-series and cross-sectional momentum. It buys the strongest winning portfolio and shorts the weakest losing portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trend following performs well during extreme outlier years for the stock market. “During the 10 largest drawdowns experienced by the traditional 60/40 portfolio over the past 135 years, the time-series momentum strategy experienced positive returns in eight of these stress periods and delivered significant positive returns during a number of these events.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tends to be a high turnover strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining Multiple Factors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using multiple factors is the optimal approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding an additional factor only exposes a portfolio to a small portion of the factor’s premium. The overall return will only see incremental improvement, if at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors need to weigh the trade-offs of negatively correlated factors like value and momentum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolios get a diversification benefit from factors that not perfectly correlated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports Betting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moskowitz tested the behavioral models on sports betting — baseball, football, basketball, hockey — to see if behavior drove outcomes or if markets were efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sports betting is not profitable. Returns are flat before fees and negative after fees. The only way to get a positive return is by eliminating the fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Momentum exists and predicts returns. Betters pushed up prices. The opening prices set by bookies were more correct than the prices when betting was closed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value exists and predicts returns. Cheap bets got cheaper before reversing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, the momentum and value effects move betting prices from the open to the close of betting. These patterns are completely reversed by the game’s outcome, and in a manner that is consistent with how these premiums work in financial markets. Second, the fact that both momentum and value have predictive value in sports betting markets, and that these factors have the same negative relationship (momentum pushes prices up and value pushes prices down) that they demonstrate in the financial markets, provides support for the idea that these factors do incorporate at least some behavioral components in financial markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All but short-maturity corporate bonds contain equity-like risks. And the lower the credit rating, the greater the contagion risk. Thus, investors who choose to include an allocation to either high-yield bonds or longer-term investment-grade bonds should consider them as hybrid instruments, combining the characteristics of both U.S. Treasuries and equities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The duration — in terms of sensitivity to interest rates — of the portfolios increases monotonically with the dividend yields. Stocks with high dividends tend to experience decreases in returns when long-term bond yields increase, while those with low dividends tend to earn higher returns when interest rates hike up.” — “Equity Duration: A Puzzle on High Dividend Stocks”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Diversification means accepting the fact that parts of your portfolio may behave entirely differently than the portfolio itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Relativity worked well for Einstein, but it has no place in investing.” – John Bogle (quoting an anonymous fund manager)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e., if history played out in a different way). Such substitute courses of events are called alternative histories. Clearly, the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome, but such a point seems to be voiced only by people who fail (those who succeed attribute their success to the quality of their decision).” — Nassim Taleb, Fooled by Randomness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, anomalies can persist even when they become well known… Second, research does appear to lead to increased cash flows from investors seeking to gain exposure to the premiums, which in turn leads to lower future realized returns. However, we note that where logical, risk-based explanations exist, premiums should never disappear… However, we do caution investors not to automatically assume that future premiums will be as large as the historical record.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“High-quality companies have the following traits: low earnings volatility, high margins, high asset turnover (indicating efficient use of assets), low financial leverage, low operating leverage (indicating a strong balance sheet and low macroeconomic risk), and low stock-specific risk (volatility that is unexplained by macroeconomic activity). Companies with these attributes historically have provided higher returns, especially in down markets. In particular, high-quality stocks that are profitable, stable, growing, and have a high payout ratio outperform low-quality stocks with the opposite characteristics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been shown that other measures of what is referred to as fundamental momentum, such as earnings momentum, changes in profit margins, and changes in analysts’ forecasts, produce premiums.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At its most basic level, factor-based investing is simply about defining and then systematically following a set of rules that produce diversified portfolios.” – Cliff Asness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Belief in the factors you choose is vital not just to make sure they are real, and not just data mining, but because without well-formed, strongly held beliefs (perhaps stemming from persistence, pervasiveness, robustness, intuition, and investability!), nobody will stick with their investing process through the inevitable tough times.” — Cliff Asness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Growth stocks are high-duration assets (much of their value comes from expected future growth), making them similar to long-term bonds. Value stocks, on the other hand, are low-duration assets, making them more similar to short-term bonds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors in glamour stocks are likely to under-react to information that contradict their beliefs about firms’ growth prospects or reflect the effects of mean reversion in performance. Similarly, value stocks, being inherently more distressed than glamour stocks, tend to be neglected by investors; as a result, performance expectations for value firms may be too pessimistic and reflect improvements in fundamentals too slowly.” — Piotroski&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The profitability premium is about 1 percent higher per month among firms with smaller capitalization, higher return volatility, higher cash flow volatility, less analyst coverage, larger analyst forecast dispersion, fewer institutional holdings, higher idiosyncratic return volatility, lower dollar trading volume, higher bid-offer spread, lower credit rating, higher illiquidity, and that are younger.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard Marks explains the pattern of cycles found in markets, the economy, and business. An investor who understands the different cycles — the history, the driving factors, their interconnectedness, and the role of psychology — can avoid common errors and best position their portfolio for success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We notice and remember patterns in order to make decisions easier, less painful, and more beneficial, so we don’t think through every decision from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economies, businesses, and markets follow a pattern of cycles. These cycles are irregular because of the swings in humans psychology and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements of a Winning Investment Philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounting, finance, and economics education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An understanding of how markets work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading (broadly) is essential to learning and questioning what you’ve previously learned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchanging ideas with other investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we all have the same information, come to the same conclusions, act on it in the same way, then outperformance is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett’s criteria for desirable information: 1) has to be important, and 2) has to be knowable. Macroeconomic info (forecasting) fails one of those two, usually the latter because it’s not knowable, or not knowable consistently enough to produce long-term outperformance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is best spent on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing the knowable: the fundamentals of business, sectors, industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better behavior: more discipline around price relative to fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding cycles: know where we are in the cycle and how to position a portfolio for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolio risk management is a balancing act between aggressive and defensive, adjusted over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In investing, the future is a range of possibilities — some known, some unknown — making risk and uncertainty unavoidable. The range of possibilities is best viewed as a probability distribution. That leads to knowing the most likely outcome, on average, in the long run. “Most likely” is not guaranteed across any single event (think coin tosses). Randomness in any one event can lead to a unlikely outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any opinion on the future should be based on: 1) what’s going to happen, and 2) the likelihood of being correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions to ask about the current cycle for those who study past cycles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it closer to the beginning upswing or the peak leading to a downswing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has it been rising for a while? To the point of being dangerous?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does investor behavior suggest greed or fear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are investors appropriately risk-averse or excessively risk-tolerant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the market overpriced or cheap due to the cycle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the current point in the cycle emphasize an aggressive or defensive portfolio stance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These questions should help determine the tilt of a portfolio: more aggressive when the odds are in our favor and more defensive when the odds are against us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycles are a continuous swing around a midpoint, which is often a longer-term trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swings follow a generic pattern of: a) recovery from the lows, b) rise past the midpoint to (extreme) highs, c) the new high, d) downward correction, e) fall past the midpoint to the low, f) the new low, g) recovery from the low, and h) back past the midpoint to another high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because cycles are influenced in the short term by people and other variables, it has no constant rate. The duration and speed of each section varies and inevitably causes the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regression to the mean is the move back to the midpoint from the high and low. It’s the powerful self-correcting mechanism in all cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the force behind regression continues to exert itself, the momentum pushes the cycle past the midpoint to the next high or low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who don’t understand cycles will be surprised by, and often contribute to, it. Those who do understand will find opportunities in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extremes are not guaranteed for every swing, but cycles that reach extremes in one direction are often followed by an opposite extreme in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general pattern of a cycle matters, because the specific details at any point in a cycle will look different from similar points in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randomness makes recognizing the pattern in cycles more complicated and less predictable and dependable. The influence of people, their inconsistent behavior, emotions, and actions add to the randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Economic Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The long term economic cycle follows fundamental factors that produce a steady average growth rate over a longer secular trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factors include: population growth which impacts hours worked and GDP growth which is affected by demographic shifts, education, technology/innovation, automation, and globalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the longer secular trend, are short term cycles too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The short term economic cycle is driven by changing variables within a population — the people. For instance, spending fluctuates based on the fear of unemployment. The lack of fear or the “wealth effect” can spur spending. It can create a self-fulfilling prophecy. If people (or companies) believe there’s a recession on the horizon, they spend less (companies hold off on new projects), and the economy inevitably slides into a recession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most economic forecasts extrapolate the current trend because it’s safe (career risk) and sticks to the status quo. Those forecasts are likely already priced into the market and offer no performance benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuable forecasts are outliers that result in surprises that deviate from the trend dramatically. The downside is outliers rarely occur, are hard to predict, and usually wrong — thus can be costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflation is a result of increasing demand for goods relative to supply, an increase in raw materials and labor costs, and/or when a currency tied to imports declines relative to a currency tied to exports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Central Banks have a mandate to control inflation and stimulate employment. The two often work in opposition – steps to stimulate one, contract the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynesian economics: Keynes believed the government should step in to prop up a weak economy through spending/running a deficit but reduce spending/running a surplus in a strong economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Profit Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, the swings in the economy influence the rise and fall of corporate sales, which impacts profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodity, raw material, and basic components see demand rise and fall with the economic cycle. Luxury goods, travel, cars (consumer discretionary), and homes do too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic necessities (consumer staples) like food and medicine are less responsive to the economic cycle. Consumers may trade down — buy cheaper, lower-cost brands in a recession versus expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company profits follow a cycle similar to the economy but not all companies follow the same pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher sales do not guarantee higher profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two Types of Leverage:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Leverage: Most businesses have a combination of fixed and variable costs, meaning costs will fluctuate. So profits depend on the variability of revenues and costs (Profits = Revenues – Costs). Management has some control over profits by managing the variable costs (layoffs, store/factory closures) but it usually takes time and may increases costs in the short-run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Leverage: Debt – cost is tied to interest payments, which rises and falls based on the amount of debt and/or interest rate being charged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A host of independent developments — management decisions, technology changes, regulations, taxation, geopolitical events, natural disasters, etc. — impact profits too, making it hard to predict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor Psychology (Human Nature Cycle):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in psychology affect the economic, profit, and market cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market pendulum swings from greed to fear, optimism to pessimism, risk-tolerant to risk-averse, overpriced to underpriced, and focused on the infinite future to the immediate present. An excess in one direction sets the stage for the swing back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition, yearly market returns fluctuate across a wide range. In other words, earning the average market return in any year is rare. From 1970 to 2016, the return on the S&amp;#x26;P 500 fell within 2% of its average only 3 times! In fact, investors are more likely to experience an extreme return than the average. The wide range of returns in any given year is a good example of investor psychology at work (business fundamentals don’t change that drastically from year to year).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“This cycle in investors’ willingness to value the future is one of the most powerful cycles that exist. A simple metaphor relating to real estate helped me to understand this phenomenon: What’s an empty building worth? An empty building (a) has a replacement value, of course, but it (b) throws off no revenues and (c) costs money to own, in the form of taxes, insurance, minimum maintenance, interest payments and opportunity costs. In other words, it’s a cash drain. When investors are in a pessimistic mood and can’t see more than a few years out, they can only think about the negative cash flows and are unable to imagine a time when the building will be rented and profitable. But when the mood turns upward and interest in future potential runs high, investors envision it full of tenants, throwing off vast amounts of cash, and thus salable at a fancy price. Fluctuation in investors’ willingness to ascribe value to possible future developments represents a variation on the full-or-empty cycle. Its swings are enormously powerful and mustn’t be underestimated.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All investors deal with emotion. The superior investor keeps their emotions in balance and takes an objective approach to investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two failings of an emotional investor: biased perception and interpretation. Investors rarely take a balanced approach to good and bad news. They focus on one-side, leading to a biased view of events. For instance, economic data is twisted in a positive or negative light depending on the prevailing emotion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Risk Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing is “bearing risk in pursuit of profit. Investors try to position portfolios so as to profit from future developments rather than be penalized by them.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk lies in the future not being perfectly knowable. Uncertainty exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How investors behave toward risks influences the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk Aversion: the preference for safety over risk (loss). Most investors are risk-averse. They prefer a certain 7% return over a possible 7% return. An incrementally higher return is required for risk-averse investors to take on risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In theory, risk-averse investors police the market. They’re cautious, analyze investments objectively, use conservative assumptions, require a margin of safety, insist on a requisite return for the risk taken, and avoid investments without it. But that’s not what happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing attitudes towards risk leads investors to be too risk-averse or too risk-tolerant at times. Periods dominated by good news, optimism, greed, and euphoria push investors to be more risk-tolerant than normal. Periods dominated by bad news, pessimism, and fear lead investors to be more risk-averse than normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, risk is highest when investors perceive risk to be lowest. When the collective investor is most risk-averse they should be most risk-tolerant and vice versa. The reward for taking risk is greatest when investors are most risk-averse and vice versa. Opportunity seeking should be highest at peak risk-aversion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate management is not immune to the swings from risk-averse to risk-tolerant either (see the financial crisis).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Credit Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marks believes the credit cycle is the most volatile cycle and has the greatest impact on asset prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The credit cycle — the ability for businesses to borrow quickly and easily — swings from wide open to closed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies turn to credit markets to finance growth and refinance maturing debt. Financial companies depend on credit markets to operate their business smoothly. When the credit window is closed, credit is difficult/impossible to get, and it negatively impacts asset prices. A closed credit market can lead to widespread panic and fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The credit cycle is an example of lenders, borrowers, and investors swinging between risk-averse and risk-tolerant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lenders move from a cautious, risk-averse position unwilling to lend without higher rates and protection from losses to a risk-tolerant, willingness to lend at lower rates and no protection in place out of fear of missing out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive lending often inflates a bubble and creates a crisis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most raging bull markets are abetted by an upsurge in the willingness to provide capital, usually imprudently. Likewise, most collapses are preceded by a wholesale refusal to finance certain companies, industries, or the entire gamut of would-be borrowers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Distressed Debt Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonds and other debt securities are typically bought for the yield and the return of principal at maturity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distressed debt is bought on the basis that the company can no longer pay the interest and principal. When a company files for bankruptcy the equity shareholders are wiped out and debt holders become the new owners of the company. Distressed debt is bought on the anticipation that the new ownership interest in the company (after it emerges from bankruptcy) is worth significantly more than the value of the distressed debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distressed debt investing is cyclical and dependant on other cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires two ingredients: “unwise extension of credit” and “an igniter.” The igniter is usually a recession or credit crunch making it difficult for companies to service their bonds and/or refinance. Those bonds begin to fall in price, selling capitulates until failure is priced in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Real Estate Cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real estate cycle has similar ingredients as other cycles — rising optimism, increased activity, higher prices, until it goes too far — but also includes the added time needed for development, involves higher leverage, and adjusting to supply/demand changes is more difficult/less flexible than other industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate development deals with delays, regulations, zoning issues, local approval, financial approval, and construction. It takes months to years to over a decade to complete a project. A lot can happen in the real estate market in the time span.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk is completing a project while the economy is headed for recession with a rising supply/shrinking demand in the market. It’s also an opportunity for would-be buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other risk is not knowing what other developers are doing/thinking. If every developer sees home prices rising and wants to start a project, that ends around the same time, it could lead to excessive supply, lower prices, and lower profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset prices are driven mostly by fundamentals and psychology, often more so by the psychological response to changing fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of the two — fundamentals and psychology — is what makes investing imprecise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor psychology affects and magnifies cycles. It’s also the driven force behind mistakes and losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Stages of a Bull Market: 1) when few people believe things will get better, 2) when most people see things improving, 3) when everyone believes things will stay better forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Stages of a Bear Market: 1) when a few people believe things won’t stay better forever, 2) when most people see things are getting worse, 3) when everyone believes things can only get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bubbles are blown by investor psychology and the suspension of fundamental analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is recognizing where investor psychology and market valuation sits in the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the market stands in the cycle dictates the future probabilities on returns. A market near the bottom of its cycle has a higher probability of higher returns than one closer to the top. Where the market stands in the cycle dictates the likeliness of future outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When to buy? You won’t know when the market bottoms. The risk of waiting “for the bottom” is in missing it and the rally that follows. Better to buy when the price is below value because you can always buy more if the price continues to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk is learning the wrong lessons from past cycles. — Marks references the 2008 crisis and investors’ “learning” that the market always quickly recovers because that was the outcome following the crisis. It fails to consider the alternative outcomes at the depths of the crisis. It could lead to investor behavior that amplifies future cycles because they learned the wrong lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors deal with two sources of error: the risk of losing money and the risk of missing opportunities. Removing one risks exposure to the other. Investing is about balancing the two — between aggressive and defensive. It should be adjusted as you move through a market cycle, assuming you can handle being wrong at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment success is ultimately determined by positioning, asset selection, aggressiveness/defensiveness, skill, and luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positioning: deciding the appropriate portfolio risk level — more/less risk-averse or risk-tolerant — based on the location in the cycles. Positioning increases or decreases the odds of outperformance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Selection: identify asset classes/securities that will be better or worse and weighting — over and under — them based on the required risk level of the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skill and luck determine the outcome of decisions. Luck plays a larger role in the short term than most will admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not knowing the future means being prepared for things that may not go as planned from a portfolio perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploiting market extremes offer the highest odds of success. Between the extremes, the odds become less certain because prices lie closer to value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing requires humility and confidence. Confidence to stick with a strategy when it fails to produce the results you expect but enough humility to know your own limitations. Yet, success often undermines both, leaving investors less humble and overconfident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future cycles will continue to be driven by the collective emotions and decisions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The plain truth is, there’s little of value to be learned from success. People who are successful run the risk of overlooking the fact that they were lucky, or that they had help from others. In investing, success teaches people that making money is easy, and that they don’t have to worry about risk—two particularly dangerous lessons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can’t create great opportunities to time the market through our understanding of cycles. Rather, the market will decide when we’ll have them. Remember, when there’s nothing clever to do, the mistake lies in trying to be clever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After 28 years at this post, and 22 years before this in money management, I can sum up whatever wisdom I have accumulated this way: The trick is not to be the hottest stock-picker, the winningest forecaster, or the developer of the neatest model; such victories are transient. The trick is to survive! Performing that trick requires a strong stomach for being wrong because we are all going to be wrong more often then we expect. The future is not ours to know. But it helps to know that being wrong is inevitable and normal, not some terrible tragedy, not some awful failing in reasoning, not even bad luck in most instances. Being wrong comes with the franchise of an activity whose outcome depends on an unknown future…” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As any system grows toward its maximum or peak efficiency, it will develop the very internal contradictions and weaknesses that bring about its eventual decay and demise.” — Peter Kaufman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study of cycles is really about how to position your portfolio for the possible outcomes that lie ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are two kinds of people who lose a lot of money: those who know nothing and those who know everything.” — Henry Kaufman, Salomon Brothers chief economist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Short-term investment performance is largely a popularity contest, and most bargains exist for the simple reason that they haven’t yet been taken up by the herd and become popular. On the contrary, assets that have performed well are usually the ones that have gained in popularity because of their obvious merit and thus have become high-priced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In investing, everything that’s important is counter-intuitive, and everything that’s obvious to everyone is wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tendency of people to go to excess will never end. And thus, since those excesses eventually have to correct, neither will the occurrence of cycles. Economies and markets have never moved in a straight line in the past, and neither will they do so in the future. And that means investors with the ability to understand cycles will find opportunities for profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are three ingredients for success—aggressiveness, timing and skill—and if you have enough aggressiveness at the right time, you don’t need that much skill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to note that exiting the market after a decline—and thus failing to participate in a cyclical rebound—is truly the cardinal sin in investing. Experiencing a mark-to-market loss in the downward phase of a cycle isn’t fatal in and of itself, as long as you hold through the beneficial upward part as well. It’s converting that downward fluctuation into a permanent loss by selling out at the bottom that’s really terrible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Falling for the sure thing—the asset that will provide return without risk, or what I call the “silver bullet”—is one of investors’ greatest recurring failings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no such thing as a market that is separate from—and unaffected by—the people who make it up. The behavior of the people in the market changes the market. When their attitudes and behavior change, the market will change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The key questions can be boiled down to two: how are things priced, and how are investors around us behaving?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No asset or company is so good that it can’t become overpriced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s only one form of intelligent investing, and that’s figuring out what something’s worth and buying it for that price or less. You can’t have intelligent investing in the absence of quantification of value and insistence on an attractive purchase price. Any investment movement that’s built around a concept other than the relationship between price and value is irrational.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is nothing as disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.” — Charles Kindleberger, Manias, Panics, and Crashes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Few things are as costly as paying for potential that turns out to have been overrated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our job as investors is simple: to deal with the prices of assets, assessing where they stand today and making judgments regarding how they will change in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Conscientious belief in the inevitability of cycles like I’m urging means that a number of words and phrases must be excluded from the intelligent investor’s vocabulary. These include “never,” “always,” “forever,” “can’t,” “won’t,” “will” and “has to.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not for nothing that they often say cynically—in tougher times, when optimistic generalizations can no longer be summoned forth—that “only the third owner makes money.” Not the developer who conceived and initiated the project. And not the banker who loaned the money for its construction and then repossessed the project from the developer in the down-cycle. But rather the investor who bought the property from the bank amid distress and then rode the up-cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In making investments, it has become my habit to worry less about the economic future—which I’m sure I can’t know much about—than I do about the supply/demand picture relating to capital. Being positioned to make investments in an uncrowded arena conveys vast advantages. Participating in a field that everyone’s throwing money at is a formula for disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When risk tolerance takes over and lenders compete avidly for opportunities, the bidding is likely to become overheated. The resulting opportunity to lend is likely to be at too high a price: a yield that’s too low and/or risk that’s excessive. Thus an overheated auction in the credit market—as elsewhere—is likely to produce a “winner” who’s really a loser. This is the process I call the race to the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prosperity brings expanded lending, which leads to unwise lending, which produces large losses, which makes lenders stop lending, which ends prosperity, and on and on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Superior investing doesn’t come from buying high-quality assets, but from buying when the deal is good, the price is low, the potential return is substantial, and the risk is limited… The slammed-shut phase of the credit cycle probably does more to make bargains available than any other single factor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In investing, there is nothing that always works, since the environment is always changing, and investors’ efforts to respond to the environment cause it to change further.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my view, risk is primarily the likelihood of permanent capital loss. But there’s also such a thing as opportunity risk: the likelihood of missing out on potential gains. Put the two together and we see that risk is the possibility of things not going the way we want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Essentially risk says we don’t know what’s going to happen… We walk every moment into the unknown. There’s a range of outcomes, and we don’t know where [the actual outcome is] going to fall within the range. Often we don’t know what the range is.” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Risk means more things can happen than will happen.” — Elroy Dimson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The events in the life of a cycle shouldn’t be viewed merely as each being followed by the next, but — much more importantly — as each causing the next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people understand that busts follow booms. Somewhat fewer grasp the fact that the busts are caused by the booms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The greatest lessons regarding cycles are learned through experience…as in the adage ‘experience is what you got when you didn’t get what you wanted.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Societies rise and fall, and they speed up and slow down in terms of economic growth relative to each other. This underlying trend in growth clearly follows a long-term cycle, although the short-run ups and downs around it are more discernible and thus more readily discussed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All these people see the same data, read the same material, and spend their time trying to guess what each other is going to say. [Their forecasts] will always be moderately right—and almost never of much use.” — Milton Friedman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have two classes of forecasters: those who don’t know — and those who don’t know they don’t know.” — John Kenneth Galbraith&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The mood swings of the securities markets resemble the movement of a pendulum. Although the midpoint of its arc best describes the location of the pendulum “on average,” it actually spends very little of its time there. Instead, it is almost always swinging toward or away from the extremes of its arc. But whenever the pendulum is near either extreme, it is inevitable that it will move back toward the midpoint sooner or later. In fact, it is the movement toward an extreme itself that supplies the energy for the swing back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of the highly superior investors I know are unemotional by nature. In fact, I believe their unemotional nature is one of the great contributors to their success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the real world, things generally fluctuate between “pretty good” and “not so hot.” But in the world of investing, perception often swings from “flawless” to “hopeless.” The pendulum careens from one extreme to the other, spending almost no time at “the happy medium” and rather little in the range of reasonableness. First there’s denial, and then there’s capitulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since risk (that is, uncertainty with regard to future developments, and the possibility of bad outcomes) is the primary source of the challenge in investing, the ability to understand, assess and deal with risk is the mark of the superior investor and an essential—I’m tempted to say the essential—requirement for investment success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good times cause people to become more optimistic, jettison their caution, and settle for skimpy risk premiums on risky investments. Further, since they are less pessimistic and less alarmed, they tend to lose interest in the safer end of the risk/return continuum. This combination of elements makes the prices of risky assets rise relative to safer assets. Thus it shouldn’t come as a surprise that more unwise investments are made in good times than in bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, the bottom line of all of this is that the greatest source of investment risk is the belief that there is no risk. Widespread risk tolerance—or a high degree of investor comfort with risk—is the greatest harbinger of subsequent market declines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s the greatest source of investment risk? … It comes when asset prices attain excessively high levels as a result of some new, intoxicating investment rationale that can’t be justified on the basis of fundamentals, and that causes unreasonably high valuations to be assigned. And when are these prices reached? When risk aversion and caution evaporate and risk tolerance and optimism take over. This condition is the investor’s greatest enemy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When total fear replaces a high degree of confidence, excessive risk aversion takes the place of unrealistic risk tolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I could ask only one question regarding each investment I had under consideration, it would be simple: How much optimism is factored into the price?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There can be few fields of human endeavor in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance. Past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.” — John Kenneth Galbraith, A Short History of Financial Euphoria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to fully understand most phenomena in the investment world unless you’ve lived through them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Value investing has a long record of excellent returns with limited downside risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a book about how to think about investing — you have to understand why value investing works. It’s not enough to know the rules behind it, but understand why the rules work, when they work, and when they don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wall Street Misbehavior: short term focused, driven by the volume of activity, ignorant of business fundamentals, casino operator, pushing index strategies designed to avoid volatility at the cost of mediocre returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutional Investor Misbehavior: short term focused, driven by performance pressure, compensation, and career risk, which pushes relative performance and fad chasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors Misbehavior: they are their own worst enemies — greed, fear, and other emotions cause investors to ignore fundamentals when making decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misbehavior creates opportunities for value investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can treat stocks as pieces of paper to be traded based on guessing its next price move or you can treat stocks as ownership in a business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest challenge is patience and discipline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors profit by:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free cash flow made by the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase in the multiple paid that’s reflected in the share price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share price moves closer to the value of the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading Sardines versus Eating Sardines: The story goes that sardines once thrived off the coast of Monterey, California until one day they disappeared. The commodity traders bid up the price of sardines and canned sardine prices soared. One day, a commodity trader helped himself to a can, opened it, and began eating. He quickly got sick. The sardines were no good. To which his friend replied, “These are not eating sardines, they are trading sardines.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculation can erupt anytime, anywhere, and not be recognized until much later, and after much money has been invested and lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driven by instant gratification: getting rich quickly is more appealing than getting rich slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greater Fool Game: buying a stock with the hopes a greater fool will quickly take it off your hands at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazy Game: requires no analysis or information about the business. It’s guessing what other investors will do, and try to do it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectibles are a speculative game since prices are driven by taste, not free cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winchester Disk Drive Mania:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;43 Winchester disk driver manufacturers received venture funding between 1977 and 1984.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By mid-1983, 12 of the publicly traded manufacturers of disk drives were valued at $5 billion in total.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was no chance all 12, much less 43, would dominate the market — only a few might survive. Nor would the market be remotely worth $5 billion in the future (based on a study done in 1983).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 1984, the total market of the 12 public companies was down to $1.5 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Market: is a helpful fellow. Every day he’s ready to buy or sell securities at a price he set that minute. Sometimes the prices are reasonable. Sometimes, emotion gets the best of him. He becomes optimistic or pessimistic and his prices reflect it. If you look to Mr. Market for guidance, thinking his prices hold meaning, it can lead to speculation and loss. Beware: Mr. Market’s prices hold no hidden meaning. He knows nothing. It’s only the collective action of millions of buyers and sellers whose actions aren’t always motivated by fundamentals. You can take advantage of Mr. Market’s frequent emotional moments or do nothing. It’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why security prices move (up and down):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reflect reality or changes in perception of reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short term changes in supply and demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all market selloffs are buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has a bullish bias. An optimistic case can be made for any security, and often is made. It’s also more enjoyable for management and investors to hear the optimistic view. But a focus on optimistic outcomes comes with a cost of ignoring risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Innovation: early success does not equate to being good. It often looks better early on, but the merits of any financial innovation must be determined over the course of a full market cycle. Problems often take time to surface. What’s lauded as a new improved way to invest is really just a fad — one that could be taken to an extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Fads: investors slap optimistic growth numbers on new technology, products, etc. that don’t fit reality. Unsustainable multiples are the end result. Market history is filled with optimistic fads that failed to live up to expectations and came to an abrupt end. The cycle of fads is a byproduct of investor behavior and unlikely to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career Risk: some fund managers invest to protect their jobs which can lead to groupthink, herd mentality, and mediocre returns closer to their benchmark (and underperform after fees). Because the risk of trying to earn the best return possible over the long run comes with the risk of underperformance, that might not sit well with investors. It leads to a short-term relative performance bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be wary of fund managers who don’t (won’t) invest their own money in funds they run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fully invested or not should depend on the number of available opportunities. Doing nothing — not being fully invested — is a smart option when opportunities are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why understand institutional investors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They dominate the market, so their behavior has a big impact on markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutional investors are often too big to invest in certain areas of the market that, in turn, offer rewarding opportunities for smaller investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk Bond Mania:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Junk bonds were sold as a new innovation in the 1980s that took on manic proportions. Initially hailed as “safe” investments but by 1990 defaults hit record levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W. Braddock Hickman showed, via a study, that a portfolio of low quality, high yield bonds could outperform a high-quality bond portfolio. The higher rates more than compensated for defaults and losses. It worked because enough investors avoided low-quality bonds, causing depressed prices. Price appreciation, not yields, was behind the better return. The real opportunity was in bonds priced to default — fallen angels selling well below par — which then improved and recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milken took the idea that high-yield bonds outperformed, pushed it excess, but left out the important point of depressed prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milken claimed low-rated bonds earned a historically higher return than highly-rated bonds. He also claimed that the risk was low because losses from defaults were easily compensated by higher yields. And he claimed liquidity wouldn’t be a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike fallen angels selling below par, Milken’s newly issued junk bonds were sold at par value. There was no chance of price appreciation. They were already priced for perfection (survival). New junk bonds came onto the market with limited upside and a big risk of default and loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because junk bonds were a new concept, the default rate was deceptively low for two reasons: defaults can take time and the number of defaults lagged behind the number of junk bond issuances — the denominator (# of junk bond issuances) outgrew the numerator (# of defaults). The true default rate was only uncovered once new issues slowed and ceased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deceptively low default rate was used to promote the “junk bonds are safe” narrative. High yields for little or no risk become a big selling point that quickly caught on. The high demand allowed junk bonds to be issued by virtually anyone looking to borrow money, from unsound small businesses in need of debt to corporate takeovers artists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study on the interest coverage ratio of newly issued junk bonds had fallen to below 1 by 1988. Pretax earnings were less than the interest expense on new issues. Debt to net assets tripled over the same period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newly created high-yield bond funds helped drive demand and forced their competition, which held higher-quality bonds, to swap high-quality for high-yield in order to compete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few thrifts (S&amp;#x26;Ls) used junk bonds, along with other risky assets, to offer a higher interest rate on accounts and grow their deposits, but it ultimately led to their insolvency and the S&amp;#x26;L crisis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rate resets became a widely used feature on junk bonds — it’s a promise that the issuer will reset the coupon at a specific date to cause it to trade around a specific price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBITDA became the proxy for free cash flow when valuing highly leveraged businesses. Which led to flawed analysis and overvaluation. If interest is large enough, like it was at the time, no earnings would exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a historically accepted investment yardstick proves to be overly restrictive, the path of least resistance is to invent a new standard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding loss should be the first goal. That does not mean no losses of any kind. A portfolio, over time, should not be exposed to the chance of significant losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loss avoidance strategy is not about having a fixed allocation to certain securities or having a fixed return goal to meet. It’s about knowing that unexpected things happen, risks always change, so you have to be prepared for that eventuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk depends on the price paid for a security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the effects of compounding even moderate returns over many years are compelling, if not downright mind-boggling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compounding requires perseverance in order to succeed. It’s important to avoid extreme losses since it can quickly wipe out years of compounding that has built up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors intent on avoiding loss consequently must position themselves to survive and even prosper under any circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the future is unpredictable, it’s impossible to know what markets will do next. Or the economy. Or interest rates. Bad luck, mistakes, rare catastrophes, and crises do happen. Investors need to be prepared for when these unexpected surprises happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value investing is buying dollars for 50 cents — buying securities at a discount to their underlying value. It combines a conservative value analysis with the discipline to only buy when a discount to value is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett’s baseball analogy: Investors have no called strikes. Nobody’s keeping track of the number of pitches you see. You don’t have to swing at any pitch (investments). You can patiently stand at the plate with the bat on your shoulder, waiting for the perfect pitches — the ones you’re most comfortable with, that you understand the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New investments must be weighed against other available opportunities and existing holdings. It ensures that your portfolio is always made up of the best opportunities. That means no investment is sacred, especially if a better one comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be comfortable with imperfect information because you’ll never know everything about an investment. And if you did know everything, then the opportunity is likely gone because the market already priced it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ways to protect from declining business values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always do conservative valuations, with the worst-case scenario or liquidation value in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require a wider margin of safety — a deeper discount to fair value — to account for risks like deflation that lower the value of an investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catalysts, that offer a time frame to realize value, help offset uncertainty that comes with the typical unknown time horizon for most investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin of Safety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows for imperfection, error, bad luck, or excessive volatility in order to avoid big losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between price and fair value is your margin of safety. The wider the difference, the wider margin, the more protected you are from surprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preservation of capital is built-in and necessary because valuation is imperfect, the future is unpredictable, and people make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin of safety can be improved by replacing a current holding with better opportunities, selling once value is mostly realized, and holding cash when no significant bargains exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to know why an investment is undervalued and to sell when it no longer applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for management that puts their own money at risk in the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear markets are the real test of an investment philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In market declines, stocks are often priced as if nothing can go right. They have the widest margin of safety and the lowest amount of risk because the worst-case scenario is priced in. They also have the highest upside. When focus and expectations shift from the worst-case to the strength of business fundamentals, the market will send prices higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value investing is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on bottom-up analysis – it makes it easier to know when the reason why behind an investment no longer applies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolute over relative performance – allows investments to be judged on their own merits, while not worrying about what the market is doing in the short term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused on what can go wrong over what can go right – keeps risk front of mind and helps to avoid losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk can’t be reduced to a number. Risk is weighed by imperfect analysis — the probability and amount of potential loss for any investment include unknowns. It’s why a margin of safety, diversification, and hedging are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunity Cost: Build a portfolio with opportunity cost in mind. Holding some cash or securities that throw off cash in a portfolio helps offset opportunity costs. Investments with catalysts, like risk-arbitrage, tend to be short term in nature which also helps as investments are sold for cash plus profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Valuation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business valuation is an art. It’s imperfect. It changes with micro- and macroeconomic changes. Assumptions of future cash flows can be made down to the penny. Just because you can discount future cash flows out to the nth decimal place doesn’t make the calculation precise or accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Graham sought to find a valuation that is adequate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets are the collective result of a difference of opinion. Buyers place the value of a security higher than what they paid. Sellers put the value lower than they’re selling price. They both feel they’re getting a deal. The buyer and seller likely differ on their assumptions of the future cash flows, the discount rate, etc. leading to a range in valuation. The true value likely falls somewhere in between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discount future cash flows (NPV analysis) can be a very accurate valuation method. But…less than certain cash flows, inaccurate growth forecasts, and arbitrary discount rates can be problematic and imprecise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More stable businesses tend to be more predictable (not always) but the predictability means it’s less likely to be selling at a deep discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many factors go into a business’s growth, making it difficult to predict — unit sales, population growth, product usage, market share, price increase…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biases — optimism or pessimism — influencing the numbers will throw the valuation further off. Too much optimism in projections could mean that everything has to go right for the projections to work out or losses are certain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conservative assumptions are the only solution to the problem of inaccurate valuations. Then invest at a discount to the conservative valuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no correct discount rate — it depends on: the investor’s risk profile, the riskiness of the investment, and alternative investment options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dividend discount method can ignore a large percentage of total cash flows and projecting dividends far into the future often ignores the chance of cuts or accuracy in predicting raises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private market valuation – must ignore inflated prices paid in takeovers when using private market valuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidation Value (net-net working capital) — current assets minus current and long-term liabilities. Offers protection — worst-case scenario — if bought below liquation value. Beware of operations that can quickly burn through current assets, underfunded pensions, environmental laws around plant closings, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relative valuation: is a yardstick for assessing how the market values businesses in a similar industry today. Useful in assessing how the market might value a subsidiary or spinoff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which valuation method to use? It depends on the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings per share is imprecise, hard to project, and can be manipulated. Nonrecurring earnings (one-time items) should be ignored as it inflates earnings. Earnings (or cash flow) is just one way to understand what’s going on inside a business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book value can be imprecise depending on the asset in question. Current assets are generally accurately valued. Building, plant, and equipment may not be. Outside factors like inflation, technology innovation, regulation can affect asset value too that can’t be easily assessed — not always negatively. Regulations may introduce scarcity making an old plant more valuable due to the higher cost of building a new one. Book value is only one piece in an analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend yield can be deceptive. A high yield might look attractive but is likely the result of a fallen stock price…with a potential dividend cut priced in. The company’s ability to survive a prolonged downturn and pay a dividend needs to assessed along with yield.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theory of Reflexivity — stock price can influence business value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a business needs additional capital, stock price determines its success. With a high stock price, built on optimism, the market might see new share issuance as a positive. Whereas with a low stock price, a new issuance might be viewed negatively or not be possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When management sees stock prices, not fundamentals, determine valuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflexivity is a wild card — occasionally very important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value Investing Niches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discount to Liquidation Value — net-net working capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate-of-Return Situations: where time frame and exit prices are more predictable — risk arbitrage around mergers, tender offers, etc. where a catalyst is involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset Conversions: distressed debt, bankruptcies, recapitalization, and exchange offers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important that investors figure out why a bargain became a bargain. Ask: What’s wrong with it? What are the flaws? The reason may help decide how predictable the outcome is and whether its a better or worse investment because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value investing is contrarian, investing against the herd, avoiding what’s popular, searching for the ignored and unloved securities. Because of this, value investors almost always look wrong and experience paper losses at first — get used to it. Eventually, opinions and trends change, the unloved become loved, and security prices rise to fair value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, no matter how much research is performed, some information always remains elusive; investors have to learn to live with less than complete information. Second, even if an investor could know all the facts about an investment, he or she would not necessarily profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamental analysis is subject to diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 80/20 rule: 80% of available information is found in the first 20% of the time spent searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low prices come with high uncertainty. Waiting for perfect information leads to missed opportunities (once all information is available, prices have risen). Investors buying at low prices in uncertain times, often do so at a wider margin of safety, that provides protection from the added risk of uncertainty, and still get rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying along with insiders can be profitable. Watch for insider buying, with their own money, in the open market. Insiders have many reasons to sell, but only one reason to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalysts help reduce risk. Since catalysts come with a defined time frame, value realization happens quicker and lowers the chance of loss in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalysts for total value realization: liquation or sale of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalysts for partial value realization: spinoffs, recapitalizations, buybacks, asset sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex Securities: securities with unusual contractual cash flow characteristics tied to a contingent event. Often rare, unusual, and hard to evaluate, which leads investors to avoid entirely, limiting demand and creating value. Klarman gives several examples:  participation certificates, certain preferred stock with unusual features, contingent-value rights, and rights offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk Arbitrage: gain/loss depends on the completion of a takeover deal. Returns are determined by the spread between the price paid and the amount paid on completion of the deal. The downside is the transaction or deal fails. Goes through periods of popularity. Periods of high uncertainty can make risk arbitrage opportunities attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All investment philosophies and niche strategies go through a cycle of popularity. When a strategy becomes popular, it sees more money flow in, increases buying, higher prices, and reduces future returns. A period of poor returns sees money outflows, prices fall, popularity wanes, and raises future returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinoffs result when a parent company distributes shares in a subsidiary to its existing shareholder. It’s often an attempt by management to unlock value — where the parts are greater than the combined business. Spinoffs can be underfollowed, often small-caps, that are quickly sold by existing shareholders for a number of reasons. It can lead to undervalued opportunities in the spinoff or the parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conservative valuation is more important in highly leveraged businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distressed/Bankrupt Securities: difficult to analyze and come with a stigma around bankruptcy that keeps most investors out of these securities. It creates attractive opportunities with debt selling way below par. Companies that file for bankruptcy have hit bottom — nowhere to go but up, once lenders are satisfied and new financing becomes available. But it requires caution. Not all companies recover to their former glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Distress Scenarios (must consider the possibility of each):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue payment of principal and interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchange new securities for those outstanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default and file for bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Cost-cutting, asset sales, or outside capital are other short-term options considered by management before the above scenarios. It can lead to a worsening of the long term business value.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bondholders, unlike shareholders, can’t be forced to go along with an exchange offer or other deal by the majority of bondholders who agree to it. There’s an upside and downside in holding out — like the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Often creditors will agree to a plan in advance of bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior securities, during a bankruptcy, often move independent of the market, since it’s tied to the progress of the reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Stages of Bankruptcy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Chapter 11 filing: highest uncertainty, lowest information, greatest opportunity (if it exists) — the financial situation is uncertain, financial statements missing/late, liabilities are not obvious, securities prices highly volatile, and debt holders may be forced to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiation of reorganization plan: months to years to reach this point — the financial situation is known but uncertainty exists around the plan and how each creditor class will fair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalization of a plan and emerging from bankruptcy: takes three months to a year — closer to a risk-arbitrage dependent on final approval, plan being contested or rejected by a creditor or plan falls through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Distressed Securities: requires patience, returns are dependent on timing, often illiquid, price must be the primary focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Distress Valuation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starts with valuing the assets, split into two groups — current assets (cash, investment securities, assets held for sale) and assets of the operating business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Account for any income statement or cash flow distortions like interest expense not being paid, costs of Chapter 11, etc. that will or won’t exist once out of bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at off-balance sheet assets — real estate carried below value, pension fund, patents, claims owed to IRS, EPA, PBGC, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze liabilities in descending order — may find opportunities at each level of debt structure, senior debt being less risky, junior debt offering greater returns but a higher risk of loss. Common stock should be avoided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duration must be assessed with liquidity risk. Investors should be compensated more for the risk of holding an illiquid investment over a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity is dependent on the availability of buyers and sellers. Liquidity is prevalent in normal markets, non-existent in panics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the right balance for a portfolio between liquidity and illiquidity, low risk and high risk, low return and high return can be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A portfolio with systematic liquation or cash flows built-in – via dividends or sales — can help avoid complacency and add a challenge of always looking for best available bargains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolio management should be about risk reduction. Reducing risk at the portfolio level, while accounting for risk in individual investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a fine line between diversification and over-diversification. 10-15 holdings is enough for Klarman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market risk can be limited by hedging, but can also be costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunity is a function of price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klarman recommends buying partial positions and averaging down if price declines. If your analysis is good, you should want to own more at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling is the hardest part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since valuation is imperfect, knowing what price to sell at is also imperfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should be based on underlying value, alternative opportunities, liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probabilities allow for the possibility of luck in investment returns. It’s up to investors to assess past success — their’s and fund managers’ — to luck or skill. Hopefully, done so humbly and objectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor returns might be due to a bad strategy, bad luck, or an out of favor strategy, soon to be in favor, thanks to mean reversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Disregarding for the moment whether the prevailing level of stock prices on January 1, 1987 was logical, we are certain that the value of American industry in the aggregate had not increased by 44% as of August 25. Similarly, it is highly unlikely that the value of American industry declined by 23% on a single day, October 19.” — Ruane and Cunniff on 1987.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since security prices reflect investors’ perception of reality and not necessarily reality itself, overvaluation may persist for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In investing it is never wrong to change your mind. It is only wrong to change your mind and do nothing about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The trick of successful investors is to sell when they want to, not when they have to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The essential point is that security analysis does not seek to determine exactly what is the intrinsic value of a given security. It needs only to establish that the value is adequate – e.g., to protect a bond or to justify a stock purchase – or else that the value is considerably higher or considerably lower than the market price. For such purposes an indefinite and approximate measure of the intrinsic value may be sufficient.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any attempt to value businesses with precision will yield values that are precisely inaccurate. The problem is that it is easy to confuse the capability to make precise forecasts with the ability to make accurate ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Small changes in either revenues or expenses cause far greater percentage changes in profits. The number of things that can go wrong greatly exceeds the number that can go right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As with any value investment, the greater the undervaluation, the greater the margin of safety to investors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A simple rule applies: if you don’t quickly comprehend what a company is doing, then management probably doesn’t either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the herd mentality of investors can cause all companies in an out-of-favor industry, however disparate, to be tarred with the same brush.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In an illiquid market the price at which a security transaction takes place is determined not so much by investment fundamentals as by the trading savvy of the participants. In the illiquid market for distressed and bankrupt bonds, being a smart trader may sometimes be more important than being a smart analyst.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All investors must come to terms with the relentless continuity of the investment process. Although specific investments have a beginning and an end, portfolio management goes on forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since no investor is infallible and no investment is perfect, there is considerable merit in being able to change one’s mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the stock market, there is liquidity for the individual but not for the whole community. The distributable profits of a company are the only rewards for the community.” — Louis Lowenstein, What’s Wrong with Wall Street&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Diversification, after all, is not how many different things you own, but how different the things you do own are in the risks they entail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best investment opportunities arise when other investors act unwisely thereby creating rewards for those who act intelligently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is only one valid rule for selling: all investments are for sale at the right price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Returns must always be examined in the context of risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;James Montier writes about the many ways investors are their own worst enemies. The book concentrates on the many repeated behavioral mistakes investors inflict on themselves that negatively impact returns in the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you get started… we all think the behavioral biases discussed below don’t apply to us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, we’re better at recognizing these biases in others than ourselves — bias blind spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, All of these biases can be found outside of investing too — diet, exercise, shopping, and other habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of our decision-making process is hardwired, having been built around survival over the past 100,000 years. It’s generally useful. Also, it tends to conflict with investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Montier breaks decision making into two systems: the X-system is the default, quick, emotional responses or the mental shortcuts. The C-System is the slow, logical, deliberate, deductive responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of us believe we run on the C-System.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of us really rely heavily on the X-System. Because it still works often enough, we trust it more often than we should. Especially for investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a three-question test to see how well we override the X-System:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bat and a ball together cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it takes five minutes for five machines to make five widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long will it take to cover half the lake?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answers: 1.  $0.05,  2.  5 minutes,  3.  47 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the original study behind the test, only 17% got all three questions right and 33% got none right. In a group of professional investors, 40% got all three right and 10% got none right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if you got all three questions right and think you’re impervious to biases, you’re not — overoptimism, overconfidence, and confirmation bias are not immune from the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the test prove? We’re good at leaping to the first conclusion rather thinking things through. It works great if we’re trying to survive being mauled by an animal, but works terribly if we’re trying to survive in the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best defense against your biases is “to ingrain better behavior into your investment approach.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy Gaps&lt;/strong&gt; — The “inability to predict our own future behavior under emotional strain.” In other words, we have a hard time predicting how we’ll act during some future stressful event. We overestimate our intellectual abilities and underestimate our emotional drive.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example #1: How we think we’ll act during the next market crash versus how we really act during the next market crash. It’s easy to think we’ll buy stocks during the next crash, especially when we think it while markets are calm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example #2: Our inability to factor procrastination into a project. The solution is to impose deadlines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors can prevent empathy gaps by planning ahead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Montier offers up the seven P’s: Perfect Planning and Preparation Prevent Piss Poor Performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to be able to buy the market when everyone is feverishly selling and not fall prey to similar emotional decisions, then have a plan of attack set up in advance that forces the action. Sir John Templeton used to set a wishlist of great companies he wanted to buy if they were only cheaper. He’d place standing buy orders at reduced prices to force purchases when emotions are normally running high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeremy Grantham: “There is only one cure for terminal paralysis: you absolutely must have a battle plan for reinvestment and stick to it. Since every action must overcome paralysis, what I recommend is a few large steps, not many small ones. A single giant step at the low would be nice, but without holding a signed contract with the devil, several big moves would be safer. It is particularly important to have a clear definition of what it will take for you to be fully invested.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-Optimism Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we tend to be optimistic by nature. we have a positive bias, believing good results will happen more often than bad results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Illusion of Control&lt;/strong&gt; — we think we can influence the outcome and often mistake randomness for control. Also, the illusion of control enhances our optimistic tendencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Serving Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we tend to act in our best interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default question for investors: “Why should I own this investment?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overconfidence Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we tend to be more confident in our own abilities. We believe we’re above average (drivers, lovers, workers, investors, predictors of the future) even though we can’t all be above average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, we often confuse confidence in ourselves and others for skill. We prefer people who sound confident even when they’re wrong. And worse, we tend to believe the more confident experts, and do so without any level of skepticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-optimism and overconfidence&lt;/strong&gt; in investing leads to more trading, higher turnover, and underperformance. Also, men are worse than women. Simply, it leads to a belief that we’re not only smarter than everyone else but we can get in and out of the market faster than everyone else.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, we can’t all be smarter than everyone else. What we can be is more disciplined than the overconfident, over-optimist investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guessing the future is hard. Overconfidence doesn’t help. All the evidence points to it being practically impossible without luck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if you want to try, you have to get the forecast right, then you have correctly guess how the market will react, and finally, you have to guess which investment vehicle will profit the most … even still, the only way you’ll beat the market is if it’s different from the consensus view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forecasts are demand driven by investors who somehow believe it’s useful (like in confirming their beliefs or offering an illusion of certainty or as an anchor to base decisions around).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or as Howard Marks says: “In my opinion, the key to dealing with the future lies in knowing where you are, even if you can’t know precisely where you’re going.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Illusion of Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; — confusing a surface understanding of something with a deep knowledge of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal vs Noise&lt;/strong&gt; — not a bias, but is made worse by biases. Being incapable of separating what’s useful (signal) from the useless (noise) leads to mistakes. And we tend to overweight some info, underweight other info, and completely ignore others. So more information doesn’t necessarily produce better results. Studies show more information does not make us more accurate, just overconfident on our accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checklists can help filter the noise from the few pieces of information or factors that really matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Jean-Marie Eveillard of First Eagle affirms my contention by saying, “It’s very common to drown in the details or be attracted to complexity, but what’s most important to me is to know what three, four, or five major characteristics of the business really matter. I see my job primarily as asking the right questions and focusing the analysis in order to make a decision.&quot;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day to day market fluctuations is mostly random. That doesn’t stop everyone from trying to give meaning to the movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“When it comes to the vagaries of the ups and downs of financial markets, Larry Summers provides us with the outside view. He co-authored a paper in 1989 that explored the 50 largest moves in the U.S. stock market between 1947 and 1987. Summers and colleagues scoured the press to see if they could find any reason for the market moves. They concluded “On most of the sizable return days…the information that the press cites as the cause of the market move is not particularly important. Press reports on adjacent days also fail to reveal any convincing accounts of why future profits or discount rates might have changed.” To put it another way, more than half of the largest moves in markets are totally unrelated to anything that might be classed as fundamentals.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fictional stories might offer some certainty for the randomness of markets but its all nonsense. It’s better to just tune out the noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we are more likely to look for information that agrees with our conclusions, beliefs, and decisions than disagrees.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes we discount disconfirming evidence as “wrong,” sometimes we’re willfully blind to it, and sometimes we twist it to support our conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Time and again, psychologists have found that confidence and biased assimilation perform a strange tango. It appears the more sure people were that they had the correct view, the more they distorted new evidence to suit their existing preference, which in turn made them even more confident.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falsification&lt;/strong&gt; — the process of trying to prove something wrong.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: We need to go out of our way to prove ourselves wrong. Learn the opposing view. Ask, “What are all the ways it could go wrong?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conservatism Bias — we’re slow to change our minds when new information arrives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunk Cost Fallacy — the tendency to allow past costs (like time, money, emotion, or effort) to affect current decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchoring, confirmation bias, overconfidence, and the sunk cost fallacy are reasons why we’re slow to change our minds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The classic study on conservatism…concludes its analysis by saying: “A convenient first approximation to the data would say that it takes anywhere from two to five observations to do one observation’s worth in inducing the subject to change their opinions.” In other words, people underreact to things that should make them change their minds…I should also point out that it appears that people are particularly bad at spotting regime changes. Researchers have shown that in a series of experiments using urns…people tend to underreact in unstable environments with precise signals (turning points), but overreact to stable environments with noisy signals (trending markets). This helps explain why economists and analysts tend to miss turning points in the market. They get hung up on the stable environment and overreact to it; hence they miss the important things that happen when the environment becomes more unstable (a recession starts) and underreact to such developments.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative Fallacy&lt;/strong&gt; — giving meaning to a sequence of random events or facts by weaving a story that forces a link of cause and effect rather than judging each individual event or fact on its own merits.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nassim Taleb describes it like this: “The fallacy is associated with our vulnerability to over-interpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stories are in constant supply in the stock market. Every stock covered in the media is given a story. IPOs literally go on a roadshow to spread their story. Then there are story stocks, which trade not on fundamentals, but hope and promise of future potential. All these stories affect our views. Almost all have an emotional pull to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The most-admired companies tend to be those that have done well in the past, in both stock market and financial performance. They also tend to be relatively expensive. For instance, the average sales growth for a company in the most-admired list is 10 percent per year over the last two years. In contrast, the despised stocks seem to have been disasters, with an average sales growth of just 3.5 percent. Thus the admired stocks have great stories and high prices attached to them, whereas the despised stocks have terrible stories and sport low valuations. Which would you rather own? Psychologically, we know you will feel attracted to the admired stocks. Yet, the despised stocks are generally a far better investment. They significantly outperform the market as well as the admired stocks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: Always stick to the facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Ben Graham insisted that “safety must be based on study and standards, ” and that valuations be “justified by the facts, e.g., the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct, let us say, from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excesses.” These wise words ring as true today as when Graham wrote them way back in 1934, but very few investors seem capable of heeding them. Focusing on the cold hard facts (soundly based in real numbers) is likely to be our best defense against the siren song of stories.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictable Surprises&lt;/strong&gt; — like bubbles, predictable surprises may be seen but the timing of them is always uncertain. Example: Several people recognized the housing bubble in advance but no one knew when it would burst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myopia — extreme focus on the short term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inattentional Blindness&lt;/strong&gt; — being blind to the obvious because we’re focused on something else.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over-optimism, the illusion of control, self-serving bias, myopia, and inattentional blindness help prevent us from seeing bubbles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: know that bubbles won’t last forever. All eventually burst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, bubbles tend to follow a similar pattern described by John Stuart Mill: Displacement –&gt; Credit Creation –&gt; Euphoria –&gt; Financial Distress (Critical Stage) –&gt; Revulsion
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Displacement — the start created by some opportunity or innovation in a sector of the market. New investment in the area germinates confidence slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit Creation — new credit (new money i.e. new share issuance) feeds the flames, feeds growth, confidence, and higher prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Euphoria — Prices can only go up is the story. New valuation metrics are created to replace the old and justify higher prices. Over-optimism and overconfidence abound. Speculation runs rampant. “This time is different!” is the word on the street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Distress (Critical Stage) — The weight of excessive leverage shows signs of cracking, fraud is found, insiders sell, prices fall, and margin loans are called.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revulsion — Panic ensues, investors would rather sell at any price than own it. The worst cases are scarred for life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Long term) Individual investors have an advantage over professionals when it comes to investing in bubbles (and in general). They’re not beholden to a benchmark or strategy or career risk or redemptions. And they don’t have to broadcast their holdings to anyone. They only have to manage their behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, bubbles continue to repeat because we fail to learn from past mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeremy Grantham on learning from the financial crisis: “We will learn an enormous amount in the very short term, quite a bit in the medium term, and absolutely nothing in the long term. That would be the historical precedent.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason we fail to learn from our mistakes is that…we don’t see them as mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Attribution Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we see success due to skill and failure due to bad luck, out of our control, or blame it on someone (something) else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hindsight Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — the knew-it-all-along-effect. After knowing the outcome, we believe it was more easily predictable than it was at the time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: keeping a record of the reasons behind investment decisions and track the outcomes — skill (right for the right reasons), good luck (right for the wrong reasons), bad luck (wrong for the right reasons), mistakes (wrong for the wrong reasons). It holds us accountable for our original views before the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Maynard Keynes: “Human nature desires quick results, there is a peculiar zest in making money quickly…compared with their predecessors, modern investors concentrate too much on annual, quarterly and even monthly valuations of what they hold, and on capital appreciation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — the need to do something instead of nothing.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study of soccer goalies was taken around penalty kicks. 94% of the time, the goalie’s dove left or right to block the kick. Had they stood in the center — done nothing — they would have blocked 60% of the kicks. They dove because they wanted to be seen making an effort and would have felt worse had they done nothing and missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myopia is not limited to bubbles. We love quick results. It’s why get-rich-quick schemes never go out of style. Also, we have a bias toward action and the urge to act is higher after a loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: PATIENCE! Discipline helps too. Also, trust in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Pain&lt;/strong&gt; — studies show we find it uncomfortable to go against the crowd even if the view is wrong. When we do, it can trigger emotional fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groupthink&lt;/strong&gt; — when the desire to conform is so high that the group’s decision-making suffers immensely. It spirals to the point that those with opposing views are shunned, leaving only those that share the same views. The eight symptoms of groupthink are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Illusion of Invulnerability — blind to overoptimism and extreme risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collective Rationalization — blind to confirmation bias and conservatism — discount all disconfirming evidence and fail to change their minds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belief in Inherent Morality — see their view as correct, so its morally and ethically right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stereotyped Views of Out-Groups — give negative stereotypes of all non-conforming groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct Pressure of Dissenters — vocal doubters are silenced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-Censorship — other doubters keep quiet themselves out of fear of retribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Illusion of Unanimity — views are seen as unanimous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mind Guards — confirmation bias is used as a filter to protect the group from disconfirming evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introspection Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we believe we know ourselves better than we actually do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundamental Attribution Error&lt;/strong&gt; — we tend to blame other people’s actions on their behavior while blaming our own actions on external factors.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We all want to think we’re contrarian, independent thinkers, or the exception to the rule. Being truly contrarian is difficult, not only because of conformity but because you’re guaranteed to initially look wrong while everyone else looks right (assuming you’re eventually proved right).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution: courage, critical thinking, and perseverance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Steinhardt: “The hardest thing over the years has been having the courage to go against the dominant wisdom of the time, to have a view that is at variance with the present consensus and bet that view.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joel Greenblatt: “You can’t be a good value investor without being an independent thinker—you’re seeing valuations that the market is not appreciating. But it’s critical that you understand why the market isn’t seeing the value.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Graham: “If you believe that the value approach is inherently sound then devote yourself to that principle. Stick to it, and don ’t be led astray by Wall Street’s fashions, illusions and its constant chase after the fast dollar. Let me emphasize that it does not take a genius to be a successful value analyst, what it needs is, first, reasonably good intelligence; second, sound principles of operation; and third, and most important, firmness of character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss Aversion&lt;/strong&gt; — we hate losses about twice as much as we enjoy gains. Or losses loom larger than gains.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A short-term focus makes loss aversion worse, since the randomness of markets in the short term can deliver brief paper losses at anytime. Also, constantly checking your portfolio means you’re more likely to notice said paper losses. So stop constantly checking your portfolio!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disposition Effect&lt;/strong&gt; — the tendency to sell winning investments and hold on to losing investments.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terry Odean studied investor brokerage accounts. He found that investors held losing stocks longer than winning stocks, are almost twice as likely to sell winners than hold losers, and that the sold winners outperformed the held losers. Any number of biases – overoptimism, overconfidence, sunk cost, self-attribution — can be behind it. Simply, we hold on in the hopes of a recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, professional investors aren’t much better. Andrea Frazzini found that the average pros are 1.2 times as likely to sell winners than hold losers. The worst performing pros were no better than individual investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endowment Effect&lt;/strong&gt; — we put a higher value on things after we own it than before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status Quo Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we prefer things stay the same and show it by doing nothing.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believing something is worth more than the current asking price and a bias towards inactions result in a natural reluctance to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing when to sell is one of the hardest, yet most important parts of investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt; over Outcome!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Casinos have a natural advantage thanks to their process. They survive by offering games of chance that are ever so slightly tilted in their favor. They’ve built their business on a process that will win out over thousands of spins of the roulette wheel, rolls of the dice, or pulls of the slot machine. Time is a key ingredient to their process. In the short term, the casino will lose on some of those spins, rolls, or pulls. They fully expect that a few patrons will beat the odds and come out ahead. A casino’s process is built on looking “wrong” in the short term while being “right” in the long run. Doing so guarantees a good outcome in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Graham on process: “I recall to those of you who are bridge players the emphasis that bridge experts place on playing a hand right rather than on playing it successfully. Because, as you know, if you play it right you are going to make money and if you play it wrong you lose money—in the long run. There is a beautiful little story about the man who was the weaker bridge player of the husband-and-wife team. It seems he bid a grand slam, and at the end he said very triumphantly to his wife “I saw you making faces at me all the time, but you notice I not only bid this grand slam but I made it. What can you say about that?” And his wife replied very dourly, “If you had played it right you would have lost it.&quot;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So focus on the things you can control. No investment process is perfect. It will not produce good results every single time. A good process, that exploits edges, delivers bad breaks sometimes but will win out if given enough time. Good behavior is key with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcome Bias&lt;/strong&gt; — we tend to judge past decisions based on the quality of the outcome rather than the quality of the decision.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every decision has four possible results: good decision/good outcome (deserved success), good decision/bad outcome (bad break), bad decision/good outcome (dumb luck), bad decision/bad outcome (poetic justice).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hyper-focus on outcomes leads to general stupidity — show higher loss aversion, embracing certainty, embrace noise, and follow the herd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge is not enough to improve behavior. Simply, knowing every behavioral bias does not equate to better behavior. Changed behavior requires changes in habits. Setting simple rules help too. Changing habits work much like compounding, small gradual improvements over time pay off in big ways. A focus on process is what produces gradual improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, focusing on process and its long-term benefits won’t necessarily help you in the short term. During periods of underperformance, the pressure always builds to change your process. However, a sound process is capable of generating poor results, just as a bad process can generate good results. Perhaps we would all do well to remember the late great Sir John Templeton’s words, “The time to reflect on your investing methods is when you are most successful, not when you are making the most mistakes, ” or indeed Ben Graham’s exultation, “The value approach is inherently sound…devote yourself to that principle. Stick to it, and don ’t be led astray.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, if we can’t invest by forecasting, how should we invest? As Ben Graham pointed out “Analysis should be penetrating not prophetic.” That is to say, analysts are called analysts, not forecasters, for a reason. All investors should devote themselves to understanding the nature of the business and its intrinsic worth, rather than wasting their time trying to guess the unknowable future. Different investors have approached the problem of forecasting in different ways. If you are wedded to the use of discounted cash flow valuations, then you may well benefit from turning the process on its head. Rather than trying to forecast the future, why not take the current market price and back out what it implies for future growth. This implied growth can then be matched against a distribution of the growth rates that all firms have managed to achieve over time. If you find yourself with a firm that is at the very limits of what previous firms have achieved, then you should think very carefully about your purchase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What can we do to defend ourselves against over-optimism? We must learn to think critically and become more skeptical. We should get used to asking ‘Must I believe this?’ rather than the far more common ‘Can I believe this?‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In fact, the illusion of control seems most likely to occur when lots of choices are available; when you have early success at the task (as per the coin tossing); the task you are undertaking is familiar to you; the amount of information is high; and you have a personal involvement. To me, these sound awfully like the conditions we encounter when investing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fear causes people to ignore bargains when they are available in the market, especially if they have previously suffered a loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors should remember bubbles are a by-product of human behavior, and human behavior is all too predictable. The details of each bubble are subtly different, but the general patterns remain eerily similar. As such, bubbles and their bursts are clearly not black swans. Of course, the timing of the eventual bursting of the bubble remains as uncertain as ever, but the patterns of the events themselves are all too predictable. As Jean Marie Eveillard observed, “Sometimes, what matters is not so much how low the odds are that circumstances would turn negative, what matters more is what the consequences would be if that happens.” In other words, sometimes the potentially long-term negative outcomes are so severe that investors simply can’t afford to ignore them, even in the short term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At a one-year time horizon, the vast majority of your total return comes from changes in valuation—which are effectively random fluctuations in price. However, at a five-year time horizon, 80 percent of your total return is generated by the price you pay for the investment plus the growth in the underlying cash flow. These are the aspects of investment that fundamental investors should understand, and they clearly only matter in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing something different from the crowd is the investment equivalent of seeking out social pain. As a contrarian investor, you buy the stocks that everyone else is selling, and sell the stocks that everyone else is buying. This is social pain. The psychological results suggest that following such a strategy is really like having your arm broken on a regular basis—not fun! Fortunately, although painful, a strategy of being contrarian is integral to successful investment. As Sir John Templeton put it, “It is impossible to produce superior performance unless you do something different from the majority,” or as Keynes pointed out “The central principle of investment is to go contrary to the general opinion on the grounds that if everyone agreed about its merits, the investment is inevitably too dear and therefore unattractive.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Greenblatt’s Little Book delivers a crash course in value investing. He covers how to view the market, why most people fail to beat the market, metrics for quality and low priced stocks, and how his Magic Formula works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market is an opportunity factory. It’s a place where you can buy a business for a lot less than its worth. Or you can sell a business for more than it’s worth. Or you can overpay and undersell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started is the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many people overlook the “importance of saving money for things that you might want or need in the future…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare every investment’s potential return against the 10-yr Treasury rate (risk-free rate of return). If other investments don’t exceed the 10-yr rate (or 6%, whichever is highest), then just own Treasuries. You’re taking an excessive risk when a better, lower risk option is available. Said another way, you must be able to earn more than the 10-yr Treasury (or 6%, whichever is highest), to make another investment worthwhile. (Greenblatt puts a hard floor at 6% (inverse of P/E 16 or 1/16) – the minimum return – whenever the 10-yr Treasury rate falls below that number.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying shares of a business entitle you to an equal share of the business’s future earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on price paid is E/P or earnings/price. But that only tells you what the business earned last year based on price. You need to know 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you think the business will earn next year — a best estimate — the same, more, or less?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How confident are you in that earnings estimate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will earnings grow after that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It boils down to attempting to measure uncertainty. More consistent businesses — smaller range in earnings from one year to the next — are easier to estimate. More erratic businesses — wider range in earnings from one year to the next — are much harder (to impossible) to estimate. The range offers a high and low estimate for potential returns to compare against a risk-free return (the conservative – low estimate – should be higher than the risk-free rate). Alternatively, consistency tends to offer less risk than inconsistent earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The range of stock prices, for individual companies, vary widely over a one-year period. The range of a stock’s 52-week high and low shows just how widely prices move in a short period of time. Over a 2 or 3 year period, the range would be even wider. Yet, we’re supposed to believe the value of these same companies move around that much too. It’s possible something drastically changed — selling much more product or much higher earnings — in the business. But it’s unlikely to be happening to every company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that? — “Well, here’s how I explain it to my students: Who knows and who cares?… The truth is that I don’t really have to know why people are willing to buy and sell shares of most companies at wildly different prices over very short periods of time. I just have to know that they do!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price paid is driven by attitudes and estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price and value are not the same thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to buy shares at a margin of safety — a big enough discount to value — to protect from losing money but also to have enough room to still make money in case your wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to predict the future. Thus, it can be hard to predict future earnings and value a business. So instead, focus on what you do know about the business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings Yield = E/P or Earnings/Price — “you would rather have a higher earnings yield than a lower one; you would rather the business earn more relative to the price you are paying than less!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on Capital — A higher return on capital is better than a low one; a company that reinvests its capital at a high rate of return is better than a company that reinvests at a low rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the two — a high earnings yield and high return on capital — you get high-quality businesses at bargain prices. Systematically investing in the two can make a lot of money. The gist of Greenblatt’s Magic Formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenblatt based the concept of his Magic Formula off Ben Graham’s net-net strategy. By buying a basket of 20-30 stocks that were cheap enough to meet Graham’s requirements, without doing additional work, the “results would be quite satisfactory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham showed that a simple system, stuck too, can achieve good returns over time. Essentially, Graham set specific rules on what type of stocks to buy, how many to buy, and when to sell. He did it in a way that, on average, bought bargains that produced “satisfactory” returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenblatt then adapted those rules to meet his high quality, bargain priced requirements and tested it. The results were good – from 1988 to 2004 his strategy earned about 30.8% per year, beating the market return of 12.3% per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The formula ranks the largest 3,500 companies by return on capital – highest to lowest – the best RoC gets #1 and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The formula ranks the largest 3,500 companies by earnings yield – highest to lowest – the best EY gets #1 and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The formula combines the two rankings – return on capital and earnings yield ranks – by adding them together. The companies are ranked by the combined total – lowest total is best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Formula ranks stocks by quality and cheapness, making sure that there will always be highly ranked stocks to invest in. It’s a relative ranking formula, meaning stocks are ranked in relation to every stock. Unlike Graham’s original formula where only stocks meeting the requirements were listed, the Magic Formula ranks every stock in relation to the entire group. As a model, there are always limits. In this case, while there will always be a ranked list of stocks, it’s possible that all the stocks ranked might, for example, be expensive (with the model showing the cheapest expensive stocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Formula doesn’t work all the time! It has periods where it underperforms the market. On average, every 5 out of 12 months it underperforms. You just don’t know which 5 months it will be. Over 5-yr periods, one of every 4 years it underperformed. The hard part is sticking with it and not second-guessing the formula during the underperforming periods. Most people quit after a losing period and chase returns somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to stick with a strategy, you must understand how and why it works. The basic principles behind it should be timeless. More important you must accept that it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the formula is systematically helping us find above-average companies that we can buy at below-average prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Formula Looks For:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above-average companies = Quality companies that can invest profits at a high rate of return (high ROIC).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Below-average prices = Bargain companies with a low share price based on earnings yield (earnings/price)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that earn a high ROIC can reinvest capital at a high rate, which can grow profits at a high rate. Companies that continue to earn a high ROIC, are candidates for some type of competitive advantage (temporary or permanent) that keeps competition from eating away at its returns. Companies without an “advantage” most likely earn a lower ROIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions to ask when thinking about risk in any strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What is the risk of losing money following that strategy over the long term?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What is the risk that your chosen strategy will perform worse than alternative strategies over the long term?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success happens over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Mr. Market is manic/depressive in the short term, you can buy and sell stocks at crazy prices. Over the long term, Mr. Market eventually get its right. It’s the short term that gets people in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, you have to wait about 2 to 3 years for Mr. Market to get it right. Buffett said something similar regarding his old Graham style investment strategy during the partnership years. This happens for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enough smart people recognize its a bargain, buy shares, and drive up the price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock buybacks lower the float (number of outstanding shares), which pushes the price higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M&amp;#x26;A, the company gets bought out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks sell at bargain prices because the view of these companies looks dim. Outlook and expectations are low, oftentimes ugly. They look less like bargains and more like trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, you’d estimate next year’s earnings and several years after to find companies with a high enough ROIC and EY. (And finding a management that can allocate capital at a high return). This is difficult. If you can’t analyze companies it’s best to take a broader approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to pick stocks, limit it to a small number of quality bargains. A concentrated group of 5 to 8 stocks in different industries can make up about 80% of the total portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Magic Formula, with its basket of stocks, shows that, on average, using last year’s earnings is a good indicator (estimate) of future earnings too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the stock market, you’re very much on your own. There’s no “tooth fairy” that magically hands out money. You need to do work to beat the market or accept average returns with index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of a solid long-term strategy — one can you stick with — combined with tax-advantaged accounts is the best way to compound your money over time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afterward covers the five year period after the 1st edition was published. The basic principles behind the Magic formula haven’t changed. Buying stocks with a margin of safety is still the most important investing concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett and Munger’s idea of buying good businesses with a margin of safety still works too. Owning businesses with a high rate of return – serial compounders – can grow value over time and increase its margin of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Formula has flaws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can underperform the market in the short term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Beating the market is not the same thing as making money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated MF returns 1988 to 2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min market cap of $50 million: 23.8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min market cap of $1 billion: 19.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S&amp;#x26;P 500: 9.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Formula is a long-only strategy. It was suggested and tested as a long/short strategy — going long the highest quality/cheapest stocks and shorting the lowest quality/expensive stocks. The long/short strategy blew up around 2000 with a 100% loss. The real benefits go to those investors who keep it as a true long-only strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the outperformance occurs when the market is moving higher — it captures 95% of the S&amp;#x26;P 500’s down months and 140% of the S&amp;#x26;P 500’s up months. (I’d explain it like this: People feel better when stocks are going up. And because they feel better, they’re willing to pay more. Alternatively, because these stocks are already “beaten down” they fall less than the overall market.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenblatt believes the principles behind the Magic Formula should work in other developed/emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenblatt admits that the Magic Formula — while it’s supposed to be simple — is not simple to manage. Just keeping track of buying and selling is difficult. Biases play a big role in that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on Capital = EBIT/(Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBIT was used because companies don’t have the same amount of debt or tax rate. It allowed for equal comparison without debt and tax rate distortions. Greenblatt assumed that EBITDA – Maintenance Capex/Expenditures = EBIT. He assumed that maintenance capex was roughly similar to depreciation and amortization charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Working Capital was used because a company has to fund receivables and inventory. Excess cash was excluded. Short term debt was excluded from current liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Fixed Assets was used because fixed assets — plant, equipment, real estate — are needed to run the business. The depreciated cost was added back into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Yield = EBIT/Enterprise Value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBIT/EV is used to find out how much the business earns in relation to the purchase price of the business. EV takes into account both the price paid and the debt used to generate operating earnings. EBIT is used for the same reason, to compare companies equally pre-tax and interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies confirm that value strategies outperform the market over time. There are several different simple measures for value: low P/B, P/E, P/FCF, P/S, and P/dividend. Most of these value measures perform best with smaller cap stocks. The Magic Formula does as well. The Magic Formula seems to outperform with large caps, where other value measures have failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Figure out what something is worth and then pay a lot less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you’re looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you’re still an idiot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It ain’t the things we don’t know that get us in trouble. It’s the things we know that ain’t so.” — Artemis Ward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investing is hard. That’s why having a disciplined, methodical, long-term investment strategy that makes sense is essential to making it through and being successful in almost any market environment. But it can’t just make sense; it must make sense to you. Having a deep understanding is the only way to stick with a long-term strategy that might not work over shorter time periods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After more than 30 years of investing professionally and after 14 years of teaching at an Ivy League business school, I am convinced of at least two things:
If you really want to ‘beat the market,’ most professionals and academics can’t help you, and
That leaves only one real alternative: You must do it yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It takes a great amount of discipline to save any money. After all, no matter how much money you earn or receive from others, it’s simply much easier and more immediately rewarding to find something to spend it on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The big picture is that we want to make sure we earn a lot more from our other investments than we could earn without taking any risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Figuring out what a business is worth isn’t easy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It makes no sense that the values of most companies swing wildly from high to low, or low to high, during the course of each and every year. On the other hand, it seems pretty clear that the prices of the shares in most companies swing around wildly each and every year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe people simply justify high prices by making high estimates for future earnings when they are happy and justify low prices by making low estimates when they are sad.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Cohen tells the story of a Russian immigrant, Sam Zemurray, who saw an opportunity in the banana business and seized it. Along the way, he out-hustled and out-innovated the giant of the industry, United Fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray’s business life started after seeing his first banana in 1893.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three types of bananas, as far as Boston Fruit (the precursor to United Fruit) was concerned: greens, turnings, and ripes. “Boston Fruit used the following standard: one freckle, turning; two freckles, ripe,” freckles being brown spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ripes ended up in a pile at dockside. Ripes never got sold, never made it to market, tossed aside as trash, and left to spoil in the sun. Roughly, 15% of banana shipments would end in the ripe pile before refrigeration came around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing wrong with ripes was most people wanted to buy unblemished bananas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray saw his opportunity in ripes. His initial plan was to go to Mobile, Alabama, buy a pile of bananas direct from the fruit boats, and haul them back to Selma, Alabama to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took $150, all the money he had, bought a few thousand bananas (ripes), rented a partial boxcar, and began a race against time. Whether he made money or not was at the mercy of the speed of the train. He gradually sold his supply at each stop along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A train brakeman, after hearing his story, suggested he wire the towns ahead to get the word out to grocery store owners, so he could sell his product from the boxcar. Zemurray offered a Western Union telegraph operator a deal (he had no money) — wire every telegraph operator ahead and he’d share a percentage of sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His initial $150 investment after costs, came to a $40 profit — a 27% return — in 6 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Zemurray had stumbled on a niche: ripes, overlooked at the bottom of the trade. It was logistics. Could he move the product faster than the product was ruined by time? This work was nothing but stress, the margins ridiculously small (like counterfeiting dollar bills), but it was a way in. Whereas the big fruit companies monopolized the upper precincts of the industry — you needed capital, railroads, and ships to operate in greens — the world of ripes was wide open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray exploited the one area the major players refused to bother with, taking what United Fruit considered trash, and turning it into treasure. He sold 20,000 bananas in 1899, cleared over 500,000 in 1903, and passed a million within a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By his 21st birthday, 1898 (he was born in 1877), he was worth $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the late 1800s, the banana trade was booming. Like most boom times, it didn’t last. One bad year — 1899 — wiped out most of the banana crop in a series of natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons of 1899 were clear for surviving businesses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Big to Survive: A company needed enough capital reserves to survive whatever freak events mother nature threw at it (later on, it would add governments to the list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control Supply: Own the fields, control the planting, the harvesting, the labor, the governments (if necessary), the costs, the prices, and the supply during down years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversify: owning fields across multiple regions, meant a disaster in one region wouldn’t wipe out an entire supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of those lessons came United Fruit, the titan of the industry, and Zemurray’s Cayumel Fruit company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is a mere succession of fortunes made and lost, lessons learned and forgotten and learned again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1903, Zemurray signed a contract with United Fruit that gave him sole rights to all its ripes. At the time, United Fruit shipped half the bananas in the world. He would only expand from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took on a partner in 1903, Ashbell Hubbard, starting the Hubbard-Zemurray Company with $30,000, which would become Cuyamel Fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acquisition spree followed, buying up failed companies for the assets. In 1905, Hubbard-Zemurray bought Thatcher Brothers Steamships and Cuyamel Fruit Company on the cheap. Cuyamel Fruit was a gamble on land deeds in Honduras, but the boats opened the door to importing bananas himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1910, Zemurray started buying as much land as he could in Honduras for his first banana plantation, to better control his supply. It was all from borrowed money, sometimes from nefarious lenders at ridiculously high rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took full control of Cuyamel Fruit, buying Hubbard’s 45% share, giving Zemurray 90%, with United Fruit owning the 10%. Hubbard couldn’t handle the risk Zemurray was taking piling up debt to buy as much land as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Knox plan, an agreement to buy and refinance Honduran railroad bonds by J. Pierpont Morgan, jeopardized Zemurray’s plans in Honduras. The plan, if ratified would add up to a penny per bunch the Zemurray’s costs, making it impossible to stay in business. The only solution was to fund a coup via revolution, won in 1911. By 1912, Zemurray’s settlement with the new government of Honduras included duty-free imports, no taxes, a $500,000 loan to repay funds for the revolution, and 24,700 acres to be claimed later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1913, Zemurray bought back the 10% stake in Cuyamel held by United Fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray was a stickler for reputation. He believed his association with United Fruit damaged his reputation after United Fruit boycott by Nicaraguan banana growers (United Fruit used Cuyamel ships, instead of UF ships, to get around the boycott). Being totally independent was the only way to repair his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1915, he was buying up ships and adding refrigeration for more control over transportation. He also started diversifying with land — in Nicaragua and Mexico — and products — coconuts, pineapple, palm oil, cattle, timber, sugarcane — to hedge against natural disaster and market conditions. Cuyamel survived WWI thanks to sugarcane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He redeemed his Honduran land claim in 1915 — his new 24,700 acres bordered United Fruit land, putting the two companies in direct conflict. The land grab and resulting conflict would trigger a merger of the two companies 14 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1925, Cuyamel was debt free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray was a farmer at heart, preferring to be on the ground, working the plantation with the other workers. That gave him an advantage over other companies, like United Fruit, with suits who ran their companies a world away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being the small fish up against the behemoth of United Fruit, Zemurray had created a startup that could run circles around the bloated bureaucracy. He was more efficient, more innovation, more nimble, had a happier higher skilled workforce, and it all resulted in higher profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His banana innovations produced bigger, fatter, better bananas (most seem obvious today, but it is new back then and looked on as unnecessary or crazy):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selective Pruning: cut runts and dwarfs from bunches while still growing on the tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drainage: improved drainage with canals and spillways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silting: purposely flooded fields because silt made an excellent fertilizer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staking: tied trees to bamboo to protect against high winds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overhead Irrigation: watered during the dry season since rain was consistent year round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 1929, Zemurray would merge Cuyamel with United Fruit in a stock swap. Zemurray received 300,000 shares in United Fruit, valued at roughly $30 million, making him the largest shareholder in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He briefly retired from the business after the merger thanks to a standard noncompete clause. - He spent his short-lived retirement as a philanthropist (and returned to his philanthropic ways in a big way following WWII).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1932, United Fruit stock had collapsed — $100/share in 1929 were trading at $10.25 in 1932. UF management was doing everything to lower costs, save their jobs, and it threatened the companies survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray led and won a proxy fight for control of United Fruit in 1933. He went door to door talking shareholders and collecting their votes to oust management. Time reported the meeting this way: “One day last summer Samuel (“Sam”) Zemurray of New Orleans strode belligerently into a room at No. 1 Federal Street, Boston, where the directors of the potent, far-flung United Fruit Co. were holding a meeting. Down on the long table from his old enemy, President Victor Macomber Cutter, he flung a handful of proxies. Said he: “You’ve been fucking up this business long enough. I’m going to straighten it out.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would remake United Fruit in the image of Cuyamel by cutting out bureaucratic overlap and waste. He said, “I realized that the greatest mistake the United Fruit management had made was to assume it could run its activities in many tropical countries from an office on the 10th floor of a Boston office building… The management had tried to tell every executive in every country exactly what he must do and how he must do it. Executives on the spot were treated like messenger boys. I completely reversed that policy. I laid down what might be called a constitution for the company. This constitution provided for a maximum of home rule in the field. It was established as a fixed policy that if [a plantation manager] could not handle his difficulties reasonably satisfactorily, we would appoint some man who could.” He sold ships, rented space in other ships, left fields farrow to control prices, diversified into other products like sugarcane, pineapples, and quinine trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1933, sentiment on United Fruits stock was turning, the price was up to $26/share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemurray would lead the company until 1951. He sold all his shares of United Fruit upon retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banana Facts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The banana tree is an herb, not a tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can grow up to 20 inches in a day in perfect conditions, up to 30 feet tall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s the largest plant without a woody trunk, that grows from a rhizome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bananas — the fruit — come at the end of a cycle. It can bear fruit year round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bananas are a type of berry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trees only bear fruit (i.e. berries — bananas) in the tropics, with two exceptions — Iceland, on a volcano’s slope, and Israel, for a yet unknown reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rhizome, much like a potato, can be divided up and replanted to grow more banana trees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no seeds. To get more trees, you split the rhizome and replant each cutting. In that sense, each rhizome cutting is a clone of the primary tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rhizome cuttings — the cloning — are its great strength and weakness from a business perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strength: cheap, low-cost production growth with total uniformity between plants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness: highly susceptible to disease. Since every banana tree is a clone, if one tree is susceptible, all species of that type are susceptible. There’s also poor weather (natural disasters) to deal with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Big Mike was the first species of banana to be imported on a mass scale and the first to be wiped out by disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cavendish species is currently the mass import and also battling extinction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United Fruit Facts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also known as El Pulpo, the Octopus, because its tentacles reached everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founded in 1885, as Boston Fruit, by Lorenzo Baker, Andrew Preston, and 10 other investors who put up about $1,500 each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 1897, Boston Fruit had $4 million in assets and couldn’t keep up with demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boston Fruit turned bananas into a volume business. Low prices were key to sales and lack of supply risked higher prices — the only way to control prices was to get much bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 1899 — the worst year for bananas — Boston Fruit controlled 75% of the market. And it wasn’t big enough. It needed to diversify across different regions to protect itself from a repeat of 1899.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On March 30, 1899, United Fruit was born. Boston Fruit merged with Keith Minor’s Tropical Trading &amp;#x26; Transport Company, giving the company $20 million, 212,349 acres across 6 countries, and 184,000 unsold shares to entice independent companies to join United Fruit. 27 small companies seized on the offer of security with United Fruit in the first 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United Fruit purposely kept its ownership in the independent banana companies to 49%, to avoid anti-trust concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 1908, it shipped 60% of all bananas to the US, 36 million stems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first anti-trust lawsuit against United Fruit reached the Supreme Court in 1909 and failed. Too much of United Fruit’s business, being done overseas, couldn’t be judged by US law alone. The majority opinion in a nutshell: local law (non-US) allowed it so it wasn’t unlawful. Any other decision would have had an unknown ripple effect across multiple countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 1910, the company owned 115 ships (one of the largest navies in the world) that carried not only bananas but mail and cargo of Central America. The company had the power to control the region just by shutting down the ships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1929 merger with Cuyamel Fruit, gave United Fruit 68% market share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company would hit its peak around 1940, under Zemurray’s leadership, with a workforce of 100,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United Fruit orchestrated a successful coup (under Zemurray) in Guatemala, with the backing of the US government, in 1954. It triggered the beginning of the end for the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“At the time of the coup, U.F. led its industry by every measure: in profits, market share, volume (and it wasn’t even close). Within a generation, it would trail Standard Fruit in nearly every category. The overthrow had all the ingredients of irony: meant to prevent the establishment of a Communist beachhead in the hemisphere, it would help create just such a beachhead in Cuba. Meant to make Guatemala friendly for the company, it would engender such hostility that the company was eventually forced to abandon the isthmus altogether.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antitrust laws hit the company again in 1958. The company lost. The agreed settlement would create a competitor at 1/3 the size of UF in Guatemala. UF would have to sell 33% of its assets to an independent company — Del Monte, #3 in market share, became the buyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It dropped out of first place in market share within a few years and the company would spiral from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“A corporation ages like a person. As the years go by and the founders die off, making way for the bureaucrats of the second and third generations, the ecstatic, risk-taking, just-for-the-hell-of-it spirit that built the company gives way to a comfortable middle age. Where the firm had been forward-looking and creative, it becomes self-conscious in the way of a man, pestering itself with dozens of questions before it can act. How will it look? What will they say? If the business is wealthy and strong, the executives who come to power in these later generations will be characterized by the worst kind of self-confidence: they think the money will always be there because it always has been.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The company brain is hardwired. Which is why a corporation, though conceivably immortal, tends to have a life span, tends to age and die. Unless remade by a new generation of pioneers—in which case it’s a different company—most corporations do not outlive the era of their first success. When the ideas and assumptions prevalent at the time of their founding go out of fashion, the company fades.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogle’s Enough draws from a lifetime of wisdom to reflect on the excesses of a financial system that led to the 2008 crisis and reminds readers of the benefits of a less greedy, long-term, client-first system (society) where success in life is defined by more than just money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, “Yes, but I have something he will never have…enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Return to Investors = Gross Return – Costs/Fees. The financial system siphons (or skims) the top of the returns earned by investors, businesses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On balance, the financial system subtracts value from our society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most money-making activity contains profoundly antisocial effects… As high-cost modality become ever more popular…the activity exacerbates the current harmful trend in which ever more of the nation’s ethical young brain-power is attracted into lucrative money-management and its attendant modern frictions, as distinguished from work providing much more value to others.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advice for those in finance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If you enter the financial field, do so with your eyes wide open, recognizing that any endeavor that extracts value from its clients may, in times more troubled than these, find that it has been hoist by its own petard. It is said on Wall Street, correctly, that “money has no conscience,” but don’t allow that truism to let you ignore your own conscience, nor to alter your own conduct and character.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“When you begin to invest so that you have enough for your own retirement many decades hence, do so in a way that minimizes the extraction by the financial community of the returns generated by business.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“No matter what career you choose, do your best to hold high its traditional professional values, no swiftly eroding, in which serving the client is always the highest priority. And don’t ignore the greater good of your community, your nation, and your world.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic of compounding works on costs, as well as returns. The higher the cost, the lower the return. Here’s an example: A $1,000 initial investment 50 years ago at 11% per year, would grow to $184,600. Of course, that’s before fees. A 2% fee per year, drops the net annual return down to 9% on that initial $1,000 investment and produces just $74,400. Now add 1.5% to cover income tax and capital gains every year — cutting the return down to 7.5% per year —  and the final total is $37,000. 80% of the total return is eaten by costs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect costs to rise if your strategy is more speculation than investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is my basic thesis — for the future as for the past — that an intelligent and well-trained financial analyst can do a useful job as portfolio adviser for many different kinds of people, and thus amply justify his existence. Also I claim he can do this by adhering to relatively simple principles of sound investment; e.g., a proper balance between stocks and bonds; proper diversification; selection of a representative list; discouragement of speculation operations not suited for the client’s financial position or temperament — and for this he does not need to be a wizard in picking winners from the stock list or in foretelling market improvements.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial System is not all bad. It does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitate optimal capital allocation for users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable efficient introduction of buyers and sellers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide ease of liquidity for assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow investors to capitalize or acquire future cash flows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow investors to take additional risk or hedge risk through numerous financial instruments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bogle wonders if the cost of the benefits above exceeds the benefits themselves. Do investors get what they pay for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investing is all about the long-term ownership of businesses… Speculation is precisely the opposite. It is all about the short-term trading, not long-term holding, of financial instruments — pieces of paper, not businesses — largely focused on the belief that their prices, as distinct from intrinsic values will rise; indeed, an expectation that the prices of the stocks that are selected will rise more than other stocks, as the expectations of other investors rise to match one’s own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most that owners in the aggregate can earn between now and Judgment Day is what their business in the aggregate earns.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation driven by emotion produces short-term volatility and opportunities for the patient long-term investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stock market is a giant distraction from the business of investing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average turnover rate for stocks was about 25% in 1951 and stayed there for the next two decades. Then it gradually rose to over 100% by 1998 and 215% by 2007. Turnover = number of shares traded as a percentage of shares outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the value of futures and options derivatives of the S&amp;#x26;P 500 Index totaled $29 trillion. The value of the companies in the S&amp;#x26;P 500 at the time was $13 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whenever stock prices lose touch with corporate values and bubbles begin to form, too many market participants seem to anticipate that values will soon rise to justify prices, instead of the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation encourages investors “to ignore the inevitable even as they discount the probability of the improbable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising speculation increases the chance of anything happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In financial markets, the improbable is, in fact, highly probable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Placing large bets on an unknown future is worse than gambling because at least in gambling you know the odds. Most of the decisions in life motivated by greed have unhappy outcomes.” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market timing is hard, if not impossible, to make money consistently. It requires being right twice: in getting out and getting back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, simplicity has always been the key to successful investing, and the time-honored wisdom of Occam’s razor…has stood me in good stead: When confronted with multiple solutions to a problem, choose the simplest one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, financial institutions and investors tend to choose complex solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial innovation revolves around complex products because it brings with it higher fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fund companies consistently create new funds to take advantage of the fad of the day, then charge a high fee for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors favor complex products because they believe complex works better than simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors in new fad funds often underperform the fund itself and a simpler broad market index fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Thanks to the innovation and creativity of fund sponsors — and surely the greed (or perceived need) of fund investors — the return that mutual fund investors received on their hard-earned capital was less than a third of the return offered by the stock market itself.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fad funds have a higher than average failure rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3,165 of the 6,125 funds that existed in 2001, were gone by 2008. Of the 4,356 equity funds, 2,314 fund managers failed to invest in the fund they managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are three i‘s in every cycle: first the innovator, then the imitator, and finally the idiot.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First principles: Commodities have no internal rate of return. Their prices are based entirely on supply and demand. That is why they are considered speculations, and rank speculations at that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In economics and finance, we place too much trust in numbers. Numbers are not reality. At best, they are a pale reflection of reality. At worst, they’re a gross distortion of the truths we seek to measure… Not only do we rely too heavily on historic economic and market data; our optimistic bias also leads us to misinterpret the data and give them credence that they rarely merit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the only valid prism through which to view the market’s future is the one that takes into account not history, but the sources of stock returns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on historical returns ignores the sources of those returns. Those sources being earnings growth, dividend yield, and a speculative element that moves price multiples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEOs and analysts fail at forecasting business growth. It’s almost always too optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1929, average after-tax profits grew at a 5.6% rate. GDP grew at a 6.6% rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&amp;#x26;A activity often creates fees for the finance system and costs shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When investors are focused, not on the intrinsic value of the corporation, but on the price of its stock, assuming some responsibility for corporate governance is the first casualty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, average CEO pay was 42x the average worker’s pay. By 2004, it was 280x the average workers. Adjusted for inflation, the average worker’s income rose 0.3% per year. The average - CEOs income rose 8.5% per year. In fact, CEO pay outpaced corporate profit growth (corporate profits, in real terms, grew at 2.9%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders rarely hold management accountable. Ben Graham complained about it in the 1940s and it hasn’t changed must since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average mutual fund investors held shares for 16 years in 1951. The average holding period was down to 4 years in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average stock in the average mutual fund in 1951 was held for six years. By 2008, that holding period was down to one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average expense ratio of the average mutual fund doubled from 1951 to 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogle’s “dreams” for the fund industry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give every investor a fair shake on costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve the investors for a lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on long-term investment strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve long-term investors (today’s clients are tomorrow’s clients too).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push corporate governance that’s in the best interest of investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogle’s Rules to Building a Great Organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make caring the soul of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget about employees (he wanted “crew members,” committed people linked together as part of a greater whole)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set high standards and values — stick to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk the talk — repeat the values endlessly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk the walk — Actions speak louder…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t overmanage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize individual achievement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loyalty is a two-way street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead/manage for the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press on, regardless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the original Fortune 500 companies, first published in 1955, only 71 still exist. Of the 2000+ that have made the list at some point, most are gone. Few companies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have had cause enough to know that the road to life is rarely smooth and that we need to be prepared for the inevitable reversals in our fortunes, whether constituted by wealth, or health, or family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowledge is not the personal property of its discoverer, but the common property of all. As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours, and this we should do freely and generously.” — Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Franklin began each day with the question, “What good shall I do this day?” and ended each day with the question, “What good have I done today?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it perhaps often in this history; for even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.” — Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have come to recognize that wealth is ill measured by mere dollars, that fame is ill measured by public accolades, and that power is ill measured solely by control over others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Success, in short, can be measured not in what we attain for ourselves, but in what we contribute to our society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man is incapable of comprehending any argument that interferes with his revenue.” — Rene Descartes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is moved along, not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker.” — Helen Keller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogle saved 15% of his salary, since 1951, toward retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worried about excessive speculation in the market in 1999, Bogle reduced his equity holdings to 35%, raising bond holdings to 65%. Otherwise, he focused on a balanced allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you plan your financial future, don’t fool yourself by focusing on the nominal gross returns on stocks and bonds; subtract the costs you expect to be assessed, and work with net returns. Then assume that even those returns will be reduced by inflation. Set realistic goals that you can reasonably expect to achieve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you enter the financial field, do so with your eyes wide open, recognizing that any endeavor that extracts value from its clients may, in times more troubled than these, find that it has been hoist by its own petard. It is said on Wall Street, correctly, that “money has no conscience,” but don’t allow that truism to let you ignore your own conscience, nor to alter your own conduct and character.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you begin to invest so that you have enough for your own retirement many decades hence, do so in a way that minimizes the extraction by the financial community of the returns generated by business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No matter what career you choose, do your best to hold high its traditional professional values, no swiftly eroding, in which serving the client is always the highest priority. And don’t ignore the greater good of your community, your nation, and your world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, “Yes, but I have something he will never have…enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On balance, the financial system subtracts value from our society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most money-making activity contains profoundly antisocial effects… As high-cost modality become ever more popular…the activity exacerbates the current harmful trend in which ever more of the nation’s ethical young brain-power is attracted into lucrative money-management and its attendant modern frictions, as distinguished from work providing much more value to others.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Davis Dynasty is a story about Shelby Collum Davis and his family. The author mixes Davis’s story of how, over a 47-year investing career, he made a fortune with the market history he experienced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes are based on an abridged version of The Davis Dynasty (a few chapters were cut from the original) which was given out to fund shareholders back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby Cullom Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was born in 1909.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His success in investing came later in life. He started in his late 30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He bought a seat in the NYSE in 1941 for $33,000. Davis thought it was a great deal. 12 years early (1929), seats sold for $629,000! A year after his purchase, seats sold for half what he paid, but eventually rallied over the next few years. It grew to $830,000 in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis was extremely frugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis used leveraged in his portfolio. He noticed how mortgages (leverage) boosted net worth via real estate ownership over time. He believed leverage applied stocks had more profit potential than a mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis took a contrarian stance and embraced stocks fully. In 1947, the Dow traded at 9.6x earnings, with a 5% average dividend yield while bonds offered historic low rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis’s timing was nearly perfect. He started a few years before the post-war boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He focused on analyzing insurance companies because that’s what he knew best. He began his career working for the state’s insurance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance stocks were severely depressed because earnings were nonexistent due to low bonds yields. Most sold below book value but paid a high dividend. Davis saw it as an opportunity with limited downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance companies were compounding machines. Low cost to run, no factories to upgrade or high Capex costs each year. Just an increasing marginal cost that comes with a growing customer base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He quit the state’s insurance department in 1948, bought an interest in a brokerage firm (Frank Brokaw &amp;#x26; Co.), renamed it Shelby Cullom Davis &amp;#x26; Co., and promoted insurance stocks to anyone who would listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He began to heed his own advice around 1948 and started buying insurance stocks himself. His firm’s underwriting and brokerage operations became secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis had 2 advantages over the average investors because of his firm and NYSE seat. He could buy more shares on margin. His firm could borrow more money than an individual investor. And his firm paid a lower interest rate on margin loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis regularly visited insurance companies to meet with management. His favorite question: “If you had one silver bullet to shoot a competitor, which competitor would you shoot?” Then he’d research that competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked for greater leadership in management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked for low-cost operators in the industry and avoided the underachievers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His early portfolio was mostly in small-cap insurers that traded OTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saw his portfolio fall by $125 million in the 1987 crash but saw it as a buying opportunity. He went on a buying spree. The next year he made Forbes 400 list with a “lowball” estimated net worth of $370 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis Double Play: low-priced stocks with the potential for above-average earnings growth. Investors buy at a low multiple, get exceptional earnings growth, and then see multiples expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Davis’s financial life had three phases: learn, earn, and return. The learn phase lasted into his early forties, and the earn phase stretched from his forties into his late seventies. At that point, he tackled the return phase.” Return phase = philanthropy.  Davis died in 1994 leaving $900 million to personal causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1992, 100 insurance companies made up 75% of his portfolio, with the rest spread across 1,500 companies (including a few hundred losers). Davis had a habit of buying 1,000 shares anytime a company appealed to him. And he just rarely sold. “The printout left no doubt what had put Davis on the Forbes list. It wasn’t a phone book list of stocks; it was a few names in the phone book. These were oldies from the 1960s that he had faithfully held… Davis remained loyal. Names he owned in 1950 still occupied his portfolio in 1990.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis Dozen: 12 stocks accounted for a quarter of his total worth — $261 million — 11 were insurers plus Fannie Mae. All were bought before the mid-1970s. “He won this prize on the original cash outlay of $150,000. The prize required a 50-year waiting period to accumulate… Once he’d bought winning companies his best decisions were never to sell. As long as he believed in the strength of the leadership and the company’s continual ability to compound, he held.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was born in 1938.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He learned under his father, from “stock talk” at the dinner table, and by helping his dad make copies of a biweekly insurance letter starting around the age of 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early lessons from his father included the benefits of being a stockholder over a bondholder and compounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He learned the mistake of buying high-priced growth stocks and being sold by management after recommending Reynolds Aluminum a “buy” in 1960 when it was selling at 40x earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked for companies with potential for earnings growth and/or multiple expansion (low multiples was not a requirement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked for industries with changing characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early positions in the fund were in tech. The fund was up 25% the first year. Saw $55 million in inflows by the first quarter of 1970. Then the market crashed. Their holding fell in price after bad earnings reports. A position in Memorex dropped from $168 to $20 (were they sold after buying more on the way down!) It was a bottom 10% fund based on performance in 1970. It was a tough lesson learned that led to looking for undervalued opportunities too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ran the New York Venture fund until 1997. He beat the S&amp;#x26;P 16 out of 20 years and by 4.7% annualized over that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owner Earnings: the amount of reward pocketed each year after a company reinvests cash to maintain the status quo, but before reinvesting for growth and adjusted for stock options, depreciation, amortization, and deferred taxes. Owner earnings are almost always lower than reported earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much to pay for a company — compare the owner earnings yield to Treasury rates. Divide owner earnings by stock price to get yield. A $20 stock with $2 of owner earnings, yields 10% ($2/$20). A $70 stock with $2 of owner earnings, yields 2.9% ($2/$70). The smart investment goes to the higher of: owner earnings yield or Treasury rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market History&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign investors poured gobs of money into early U.S. railroad projects in the mid-1800s, leaving them with big losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynes called the low-interest rates of the 1940s the “balm and sweet simplicity of no percent.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enthusiasm for bonds hit a peak in the 1940s (the disdain for stocks was high). Rates on long-term Treasuries bottomed at 2% in 1946. It would kick off a 34-year bond bear market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1946 Federal Reserve Board survey showed 90% said they would not own stocks. The masses held a “collective grudge against the market.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The late 1960s kicked off a growth fund craze. Momentum-driven stocks soared. Electronics were hot stocks. The Nifty-Fifty were viewed as never sell stocks. Investors became performance chasers, moving in and out of the top mutual funds. Buffett closed his partnership in 1969 and bought municipal bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Nifty Fifty lessons:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only 3 Nifty Fifty stocks went on to grow earnings at 15% or more through 2000 — Philip Morris, McDonald’s, and Merck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study by Twentieth Century Fund found that blindly owning the entire market from 1960 to 1968 was more rewarding than paying a fund manager to pick stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1969 ended the bull market. It continued falling into 1970. Both inflation and recession existed — stagflation. Dow down 36%. Hot stocks and electronics got killed, down 77% on average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the bear market of 1973-’74, stocks still looked cheap in ’76. Buffett said he felt like an oversexed teenager at a dance hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1979 — stocks were priced for terrible news, selling at single-digit P/E’s and less than book value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1980s — the Fed fights inflation. Prime rates rose to 20.5% and 30-yr Treasuries hit 15% (bond deal of the century which few people bought). The average investor couldn’t see past high inflation to notice a great deal of 15% Treasuries. Investors are always too focused on short-term worries to recognize long-term opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold and silver prices soared in 1980. The high demand and fear buying dropped off after gold bugs predicted higher prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1981 — recession and the Dow fell 24%. The last bear market before a 20-year bull run. Inflation subsided, Fed cut rates, commodity prices fell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The late 1980s — Reagan added $1 trillion in new debt. Low rates drove consumer/corporate borrowing and overpaying on assets. Mike Milken led the junk bond frenzy, the famous Predator’s Ball, leveraged buyouts and hostile takeovers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1980s brought trading back in vogue. Newsletters popped up to profit off the fad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1987 crash — Dow lost 23% on Black Monday. A 36% drop from the high that year. Doom and gloom pundits called for further losses. They were wrong. Despite the crash, the 1987 market ended slightly positive for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1991 — recession. Banks had trouble due to the high debt of the ’80s. Citicorp was too big to fail in the late ’80s. Japan in the ’90s was like the US in the ’30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The similarity between the late ’60s and ’90s: ’69 was computer peripherals, mainframes, and electronics companies. The ’90s were Dotcoms, chip makers, networking, and connectivity. All were high P/E stocks which everyone was buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1920s, the 1960s, and 1990s were each high P/E market crash events. About 30 years between each one, roughly one generation removed, and enough time to forget each prior blowout and bust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Graham issued a market excess warning in the ’60s. Buffett did it in the ’90s. The Fed called market exuberance each time too – William McChesney Martin in ’65 and Alan Greenspan on Dec. 5, 1996. Both markets continued higher for 4 more years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s again drove high debt use, this time by consumers. People borrowed to pay bills, borrowed against homes to buy stuff, which doesn’t make debt work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s — like each boom before it, only short-term performance mattered to investors, media, and pundits. Mutual funds were graded based on their performance over 6 months or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative accounting pops up in boom times. It happened in ’69 and late ’90s (saw it in ’08 too), where some “companies were fluffing the books to meet Street expectations and create an illusion of predictable success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett called the 1999 top. Most people were buying the market at 50x earnings after fees (Fortune 500 companies were selling at $10 trillion, on $300 billion of earnings, minus the 1% fees or $100 billion, gives a payoff of $200 billion). Buffett said the market had to sell off slowly or quickly or stay flat until earnings caught up. It couldn’t rise further without violating the laws of financial gravity. $3 trillion valuation on $200 billion is reasonable, not $10 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Davis Tenets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid cheap stocks: it’s cheap for a reason, likely because it’s a poor company. Even if it turns around, it takes longer than most expect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid expensive stocks: great companies may be expensively priced but should be bought at sensible prices. “No business is attractive at any price.” — Shelby Davis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy moderately priced stocks with moderate growth: find companies with growth rates faster than the multiples — leads to earnings growth and multiple growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait until the price is right: bear markets are buying opportunities and can happen market-wide, industry-wide, or to individual stocks. “Bear markets make people a lot of money, they just don’t know it at the time.” — Shelby Cullom Davis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t fight progress: carefully choosing tech companies, with real earnings and franchises, lets you profit off dramatic changes in the economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in a theme: were the “top-down” theme influences were to look for “bottom-up” value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let your winners ride: “I was comfortable owning a stock through two or three recessions, or market cycles. That way, I learned how the company handled bad times, as well as good times.” — Shelby Davis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bet on superior management: never buy anything without assessing leadership. It may pay to follow great leaders that move to new companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore the rear-view mirror: “The most valuable lesson to learn from history on Wall Street is that history doesn’t exactly repeat itself.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay the course: investing is a marathon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Venture Fund Stock Checklist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-class management with a track record of honesty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovative research used to the company’s maximum advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operates home and abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sells products/services unlikely to become obsolete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High insider ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High returns on investor capital and management that rewards investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-cost producer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holds dominant/growing market share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History of being good at M&amp;#x26;A — makes acquisitions more profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s unrealistic to expect companies to grow at 15 percent for extended periods. Most great companies can’t do it. People who pay high prices for stocks, based on high growth assumptions, are asking for trouble up the line.” — Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Owning some of the finest companies in the world was a lousy deal if you overpaid and a worse deal if you bought the most expensive Nifties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fast growth in the latest emerging phenom doesn’t necessarily mean fat profits for foreign enthusiasts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’d be crazy to own a business that yields 3.3% instead of a 6% bond, unless the business can increase its earnings yield in the future. In other words, it must be able to grow. The challenge is to project the growth out eight or ten years. For any projection to be close to the mark, the business must be relatively predictable. You can’t pin a ten-year forecast on the typical tech company. Even if you buy tech at a relatively cheap price, it can take years before the return on the stock matches the return on a bond.” — Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our best bear protection is buying companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, real earnings, and powerful franchises. These companies can survive bad times and eventually become more dominant as weaker competitors are forced to cut back or shut down.” — Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re deploying cash today, hoping to get more cash back in the future. That’s all investing is. For us, the whole process hinges on two questions: What kind of businesses to buy, and how much to pay for them? To answer question one: A company worth buying makes more money than it spends. Its profit is recycled for maximum shareholder benefits. The second question, the price tag, is often ignored.” — Chris Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Owning shares in a successful company is far more rewarding than owning its bonds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you know the rate of return on your investment, the Rule of 72 tells you how long it will take to double your money. The greater the return, the faster the compounding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line on this portfolio is: A few big winners are what count in a lifetime of investing, and these winners need many years to appreciate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any young, inexperienced investor has a built-in advantage over a mature sophisticated investor: Time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For maximum compounding, stocks can be held indefinitely, while bonds outperform intermittently.” — Peter Lynch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Great investing requires an independent spirit, and the courage to acquire assets the crowd disdains.” — Peter Lynch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of my most rewarding investments came from slow-growth industries where expectations were low and profits lackluster. By looking for the most inspiring competitors in uninspiring lines of work, I often found great growth enterprises priced for mediocrity.” — Peter Lynch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve all heard that people who are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat it. On Wall Street, history repeats itself routinely, as corrections and bear markets turn into bull markets sooner or later. Investors who are ignorant of this pattern aren’t necessarily doomed, but they are likely to lose money trying to escape stocks at inopportune moments.” — Peter Lynch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My father hated taxes, so margin became his favorite weapon against the IRS. The interest he paid on his loans was tax-deductible, and his deductions wiped out the taxes he’d otherwise have owed on the dividends he got. Also, by raising the stakes on his investing, margin kept him focused.” — Shelby Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Out of crisis comes opportunity. A down market lets you buy more shares in great companies at favorable prices. If you know what you’re doing, you’ll make most of your money from these periods. You just won’t realize it until much later.” — Shelby Cullom Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where is the incentive if children and grandchildren start out with a trust fund which guarantees they never had to work?… I believe in providing a “safety net” in case of emergency but, predominantly, I believe in the incentive to excel…and contribute to the common good.” — Shelby Collum Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Philosophy and theology give you the perfect background for investing. To succeed at investing, you need a philosophy. Then you’ve got to pray like hell.” — Shelby Collum Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On writing his insurance newsletter: “It’s not for the readers. It’s for us. We write it for ourselves. Putting ideas on paper forces you to think things through.” — Shelby Collum Davis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On insurance earnings: “New life insurance sales built future prosperity while resulting in continuously reporting short-term losses, because commissions and marketing costs were deducted from earnings up front. An insurance policy that brought income to the company for the next 30 to 40 years went on the books as a debit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buffett Partnership Letters are classic reading for any value investor. Readers get an inside view of Warren Buffett’s investment philosophy — seeing where it did and did not evolve — early in his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1957 to 1968, the Buffett Partnership earned a 31.6% annual return (25.3% for limited partners), with no losing years, compared to 9.1% for the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett saw a satisfactory return as one that beat the Dow by 10% over the long term. And if he could not beat the Dow, it was best for the partners to invest through someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His goal was to outperform in bear markets with average performance in bull markets — targeting a half percent decline for each 1% decline in the Dow. He constantly reminded the partners of it — tempered their expectations — every time he handily beat the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He favored a conservative approach, avoiding permanent capital loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 years is his minimum time needed to judge good performance (5 years is better), assuming the period saw both strong and weak markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At all times, I attempt to have a portion of our portfolio in securities as least partially insulated from the behavior of the market, and this portion should increase as the market rises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett’s Fees: one-fourth of profits above 6% per year, with any year falling short of 6% in profits would be carried forward against future profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexes are tough competition to beat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett annually compared four of the largest mutual funds at the time against the Dow: “I present this data to indicate the Dow as an investment competitor is no pushover, and the great bulk of investment funds in the country are going to have difficulty in bettering, or perhaps even matching, its performance.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of outperformance from the funds was due, in his opinion, to a combination of group decisions making it harder to come to a consensus decision, desire to conform (herd mentality) to what other funds are doing, that average performance is safer than the risk of being different, broad diversification, and inertia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That said, Buffett does see a benefit in mutual funds despite their lack of alpha — ease of use, freedom from decision making, automatic diversification, and a better alternative than the speculative trouble an investor can get into on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of a portfolio can help or hurt returns depending on how its invested — helpful in control situations, hurtful in passive investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conservative portfolio is measured by how well it performs in a bear market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good or bad performance should be measured against a benchmark(s), not by gains or losses in a year. Investors should objectively evaluate their performance against that benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I can and do promise is that: Our investments will be chosen on the basis of value, not popularity; that we will attempt to bring risk of permanent capital loss (not short-term quotational loss) to an absolute minimum by obtaining a wide margin of safety in each commitment and a diversity of commitments…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joys of Compounding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume the voyage of Columbus had been underwritten with $30,000 in venture capital. Had the money been invested differently, say at 4% compounded annually to the present (i.e. 1962), Spain would have watched it grow to $2 trillion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume Francis I of France paid $20,000 for Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa in 1540. Had he instead invested the money at 6% compounded annually (after-tax, of course), his estate would worth $1 quadrillion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manhattan was sold in 1626 to Peter Minuit for the rough equivalent of $24. Who got the better deal? A 1965 appraisal, at $20 per square foot puts the value at $12.5 billion. But had the Indians invested that $24 at 6.5%, it would be worth $42 billion over the same time. If they got a half point better — 7% instead — they’d have $205 billion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservative investing is not the same as conventional investing. There are times when a conservative approach means being conventional — investing like everyone else — but there will also be times when a conservative approach means being unconventional. Conservative investing is not about seeking agreement with others but making a proper assessment of many situations while maintaining the primary goal of avoiding the temporary and permanent loss of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of investing is to earn the best after-tax return possible, which is not the same as paying the lowest amount of taxes. Holding on to investments to avoid paying taxes is often at odds with earning the best after-tax return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing is about probabilities and expectations which results can diverge from in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Position Sizing: He based it on the probability that an investment might result in worse relative performance to the Dow. Given two stocks with the same expected returns, the one with the lower probability of performing worse than the Dow gets the higher weighting in the portfolio. Overall weighting is determined by how tiny the probability can get. He was willing to go as high as 40% in any one position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of 1967 was the first time Buffett complained about finding a lack of good opportunities. He questioned whether it was due to a change in the market environment, portfolio size, or more competition. He refused to invest outside his comfort zone, or chase the popular tech stock craze of the late ’60s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of 1967, Buffett said it was no longer possible for him to beat the Dow by 10% due to the late ’60s market behavior (he changed it to 5% over the Dow or 9%, whichever is lower). He saw a “distortion of a sound idea” — a shift in focus from long term performance to short term performance, leading to speculation in order to achieve the highest returns possible in the shortest amount of time. Buffett wasn’t willing to change his strategy to something he didn’t understand just to compete against the Go-Go funds. He would rather pass on the large, easy profits because of the risk of large capital losses that came with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1967 was the first time he floated the possibility of retiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Quantitative vs. Qualitative Analysis: both approaches can be used to make money. Investors who prefer one or the other, likely combine the two to some extent. Buffett considers himself of the quantitative type, but said his best ideas were qualitative — only when he had a “high probability insight.” But those insights are rare. The quantitative side needs no insight — the numbers are either obvious or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better to work with quality management that earn a decent return than chase a few percentage points higher returns by working with horrible management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommended partners read The &lt;a href=&quot;/money-game-summary&quot;&gt;Money Game&lt;/a&gt; in 1968.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go-Go Fund manager on investing in 1968: “The complexities of national and international economics make money management a full-time job. A good money manager cannot maintain a study of securities on a week-by-week or even a day-by-day basis. Securities must be studied in a minute-by-minute program.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett announced his retirement in the May 1969 letter and offered a plan to liquate the partnership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommended partners invest with Bill Ruane — Buffett’s classmate in Ben Graham’s class at Columbia — after the partnership liquidation. He earned similar returns to the partnership with more volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy bonds like you would stocks — only invest in what you understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bond maturity: selection should be based on the shape of yield curve, the expectation of future interest rates (most difficult to assess), and the ability to stomach price fluctuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio Construction:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generals:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undervalued securities, with a wide margin of safety, no view on corporate policy or when price appreciation might occur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bargain price is a must, but also good management or new management in a decent industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He likes to see companies with improving earnings/increasing asset values, that the market hasn’t recognized yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s the largest portion of the portfolio with the best total returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual position size: 5% – 10% for each of 5 or 6 generals, with small positions in 10-15 others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More concerned about buying at the right price then selling at the best price — squeezing the last penny out of a deal. He was happy selling below fair value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to move with the market — performing well in rising markets, poorly in declining markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 1964 letter, he split Generals into two groups: “Private Owner Basis” and “Relatively Undervalued.” The “Private Owner Basis” were the typical Generals as described above. The “Relatively Undervalued” were securities selling cheap relative to other similar securities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workouts (i.e. Special Situations):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are dependent on a specific corporate action or event in order to profit, making it easier to predict when and how much could be earned, and the risk of it falling through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually the result of corporate sales, spinoffs, mergers, liquidations, tenders, reorganizations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk is that something — anti-trust issue, shareholder disapproval — causes management to abandon the planned action or event making any potential profit impossible. Misjudging the risk can be expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to perform independently to the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workouts are used to insulate a portion of the portfolio from the short term (mis)behavior of markets. Typically, performing better in bear markets but lagging in bull markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second-largest portion of the portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically in 10-15 workouts at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett used borrowed money in workouts — a borrowing limit of 25% of the portfolio’s net worth — because of the higher degree of safety due to predictability of results and lower chance of short-term declines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control Situations:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The activist role: Buy a controlling interest in a company or a large enough position to influence corporate policy (he would rather others did the work).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires a wide margin of safety and a large profit potential to be worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each situation is expected to take several years — to gain enough shares to assume control and to realize a profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generals may become control situations if the price remains low for a long enough time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can insulate the portfolio from short-term market moves, like workouts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tend to move independently to the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once controlled, market price was irrelevant. Operating performance of the business was all that mattered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentioned Holdings:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commonwealth Trust Co. (1958 Letter)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 to 20% position in the three partnerships at the time — at roughly 12% of outstanding shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average purchase price was $51. The intrinsic value was $125. $10/share in earnings. $50 million in assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large bank owned 25.5% of outstanding shares, with the potential to merge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illiquid, inactive stock — only 300 shareholders with 2-3 trades per month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett eventually sold it for a profit — $80/share — because he found a (better) investment in a control situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sanborn Map (1960 Letter)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;35% position in the portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett’s first attempt as an activist investor in a control situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published and revised detailed city maps — showing water mains, fire hydrants, roof types, etc. — in the U.S. mostly for fire insurance companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The map was a monopoly, that eventually declined due to a new, competitive method of underwriting that didn’t require maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it also held a substantial investment portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1958, shares sold at $45/share, valuing the investment portfolio at 70 cents on the dollar and getting the map business free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal was to separate the two, the portfolio from the map business, to realize the fair value of the portfolio and make the map business profitable again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The board objected, instead offering to exchange Sanborn stock for the securities in the investment portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company (1961 Letter)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started as a general but took control (70%) in 1961 — started buying shares five years prior, with an average price of $28/share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly inactive market for the shares, only 15 shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufuctured farm equipment and water systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had static revenue and no profits over the prior decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially used a 40% discount on inventory and a 15% discount on receivables in estimating value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal was to sell off assets and turnaround the company by restoring earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installed new management — Harry Bottle — after old management refused to make changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottle exceeded expectations. He sold assets for cash and turned Dempster profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excess cash — from asset sales and profits — was invested in undervalued securities via a portfolio within Dempster. The portfolio was initially valued at $35/share — higher than the average purchase price of Dempster stock — plus the newly profitable business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The business (minus the portfolio) was sold in 1963 at $80/share. The partnership retained control of the portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berkshire Hathaway
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Announced a controlling interest in the November 1965 letter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially bought as a General.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought below net current asset value – initially valued it at 100% current assets and 50% fixed asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought National Indemnity and National Fire and Marine through Berkshire in 1967.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. through Berkshire in 1969.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett had low expectations of the textile business in 1969. He was more enthusiastic about the insurance and bank businesses. He didn’t want to liquidate the textile business and put 1,100 people out of work (so long as the textile business earned a decent profit and did not need large additional amounts of capital).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I find it much easier to think about what should develop over a relatively long period of time than what is likely in any short period. As Ben Graham said: “In the long run, the market is a weighing machine – in the short run, a voting machine.” I have always found it easier to evaluate weights dictated by fundamentals than votes dictated by psychology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My mentor, Ben Graham, used to say: ‘Speculation is neither illegal, immoral nor fattening (financially).‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would consider a year in which we declined 15% and the Average 30% to be much superior to a year when both we and the Average advanced 20%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I make no attempt to forecast the general market — my efforts are devoted to finding undervalued securities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just because something is cheap does not mean it is not going to go down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You will not be right simply because a large number of people momentarily agree with you. You will not be right simply because important people agree with you… You will be right, over the course of many transactions, if your hypotheses are correct, your facts are correct, and your reasoning is correct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Short periods of measurement exaggerate chance fluctuations in performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I can and do promise is that: Our investments will be chosen on the basis of value, not popularity; that we will attempt to bring risk of permanent capital loss (not short-term quotational loss) to an absolute minimum by obtaining a wide margin of safety in each commitment and a diversity of commitments…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is always startling to see how relatively small differences in rates add up to very significant sums over a period of years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Never count on making a good sale. Have the purchase price be so attractive that even a mediocre sale gives good results. The better sales will be the frosting on the cake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If a 20% or 30% drop in the market value of your equity holdings is going to produce emotional or financial distress, you should simply avoid common stock type investments.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…my own investment philosophy has developed around the theory that prophecy reveals far more of the frailties of the prophet than it reveals of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The course of the stock market will determine, to a great degree, when we will be right, but the accuracy of our analysis of the company will largely determine whether we will be right. In other words, we tend to concentrate on what should happen, not when it should happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The availability of a quotation for your business interest (stock) should always be an asset to be utilized if desired. If it gets silly enough in either direction, you take advantage of it. Its availability should never be turned into a liability whereby its periodic aberrations in turn formulate your judgments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the really big money tends to be made by investors who are right on qualitative decisions but, at least in my opinion, the more sure money tends to be made on the obvious quantitative decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in 1937, Ben Graham covers the basics of accounting and financial statements. It’s a condensed guide on reading the balance sheet and income statement, explaining common metrics, and tips on how to determine the soundness of a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial statements offer a picture of a company’s financial soundness and operating results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance sheet shows how much a company owns (assets) and owes (liabilities) at a particular point in time. Assets and liabilities must balance out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assets = property like plants and equipment, accounts receivable, cash, intangible assets like goodwill, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liabilities = accounts payable, current debt, long term debt plus stockholder equity, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intangible assets can be over-inflated or deflated depending on the company. The same is true for goodwill, and assets written down through depreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company’s size can be measured by its assets or sales, relative to the other companies in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On small-cap investing: “Where the purchase is made for speculative profits, or long-term capital gains, it is not so essential to insist upon dominant size, for there are countless examples of smaller companies prospering more than larger ones. After all, the large companies themselves presented the best speculative opportunities while there were still comparatively small.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “watered stock” was given to companies that inflated their asset value, thus inflating book value, which was later written off with special charges against earnings. Graham’s offers U.S. Steel’s inflated $600 million value in assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, asset values on a balance sheet may or may not represent an accurate value of an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depreciation, amortization, and depletion apply a normal wearing out or aging of building and equipment over its typical lifespan. It allows the cost of the asset to be charged off (the income statement) over a series of years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depletion is used in commodity businesses like mining or oil to account for resources taken out of the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current assets listed as “marketable securities” might be a place to unearth hidden value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intangible assets can’t be accurately weighed or measured. Includes patents, trademarks, goodwill, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be hidden value found in goodwill. If goodwill is written off, after a company has improved financially, it’s likely that goodwill is worth more than what is stated on the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real value of intangible assets is more likely found in the income statement than the balance sheet. “It is the earning power of these intangibles rather than their balance sheet valuation, that really counts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current assets are cash or assets that are easily converted into cash like receivables and inventory — and are shown in order of liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current liabilities are debts incurred during normal business operations to be paid or maturing within one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Ratio = current assets/current liabilities. A high current ratio shows that the company will have no problem meeting short-term obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More liquid current assets allow for a lower margin above current liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working Capital (or Net Current Assets) = current assets – current liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excess of Working Capital makes it easier for a company to run daily operations, grow the business, and meet emergency needs without taking on new financing. A lack of working capital means its harder to cover current liabilities and likely means forgoing business growth, with a worst-case scenario of bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham’s Net-Net Working Capital Strategy: “The working capital available for each share of common stock is an interesting figure in common stock analysis. The growth or decline of the working capital position over a period of years is also worthy of the investor’s attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory)/Current Liabilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inventory should be looked at in relation to other factors in order to assess how efficiently the company turns assets into profit — like turnover (turnover ratio = annual sales/inventory). Inventory turnover can be compared on a year to year basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receivables can be looked at against sales and compared year to year. A large ratio of receivables to sales means the company may be at a higher risk of loss due to unpaid accounts. Also, watch for companies that allow long-term payment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks selling below its cash value per share may be worth more than its valued by the market. Stockholders may benefit from an appreciation in price or distribution of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important individual item among the current liabilities is that of Notes Payable.” If notes payable — accounts payable — is larger then cash and receivables the company may be too reliant on credit. When looked at over several years, if accounts payable grows faster than sales and profits, then its a sign of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserves is an all-encompassing term for money set aside to be used for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham breaks reserves into 3 classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definite liabilities — for taxes, accident claims, legal settlements, customer refunds, etc. that are closer to current liabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offset against an asset — losses on receivables, decline in inventory may be an actual decline or set up to offset a future decline (if its a future decline, it may be a surplus).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually a surplus — contingency reserves or money set aside for a future purpose that is more likely not used as intended but only if it gets transferred back to surplus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book value attempts to show the liquidation value of all the tangible assets, but in reality, the true liquidation value is more likely to be less than book value. The reason: inventory and fixed assets are likely to be sold at a significant loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book Value = total assets – intangible assets – liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book value may be overstated or understated depending on reserves that should be considered a surplus. Reserves considered a surplus should be added into book value to get a closer approximation of the true book value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Current Asset Value (NCAV) = Current assets – liabilities and preferred stock. NCAV might be a good representation of liquidation value if current assets are a large portion of total assets. Stocks selling below NCAV may be extremely undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earning Power = a company’s expected earnings over a period of future years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintenance and depreciation may under- or overstate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average earnings over several years should easily cover interest and dividend payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware of companies showing a trend in improved earnings. “However, before purchasing a common stock because of its favorable trend it is well to ask two questions: (a) How certain am I that this favorable trend will continue, and (b) How large a price am I paying in advance for the expected continuance of the trend?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future earnings estimates explain why two stocks with similar earnings per share can trade at vastly different P/E ratios. A low P/E stock has a low expected earnings growth priced in while a high P/E stock reflects a high expected earnings growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 ways that corporations can use financial reporting to enhance their value are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce their cost of capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve their credit ratings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase their price-earnings multiple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“every debit must have a credit”, double entry system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a well managed and profitable business will show a strong flow of cash through the plumbing of accounts from net income to growing/decreasing equity and/or dividend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cash based accounting:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transaction are recorded on the basis of inflow and outflow of cash when the money actually changes accounts, not when the service or product is provided or received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;useful for small businesses that operate on a cash basis, such as “mom and pop” style businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s not a good fit for large business due to it is slow and delayed in tracking revenues and expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accrual accounting:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expenditures must be recorded when incurred and not when paid. Similarly, revenue must be recorded when there is an outflow of services or goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it provides a clearer and realistic picture of the company’s performance, however, cashflow statement analysis would be required to account for any inconsistencies caused from accrual accounting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies with net incomes consistently at or more than 20% revenues often are industry leaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies with strong liquidity and little external debt are likely to “sail on through the troubled times”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett sees stocks as “equity bonds” with ever-rising “yields,” or earnings per share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider selling any stock priced more than 40 times its earnings per share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid investing in companies with high expenses for research, depreciation and interest.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 1950s, an economist and professional investor named Benjamin Graham served as a mentor to Warren Buffett, who went on to become one of the world’s wealthiest people. Graham pioneered the practice of value investing – that is, buying into companies with low stock prices. Buffett, Graham’s student at New York’s Columbia University, later worked as an analyst at Graham’s Wall Street investment firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When he started his own investment business, Buffett altered the Graham method of value investing in several ways. For one, Buffett ignores the Graham rule of selling stocks after they appreciate by 50%, because sometimes their prices will rise much more. Graham would buy a stock based primarily on its cost – the lower, the better. Buffett favors high-quality companies with predictable cash flows, so he is inclined to pay a “fair price” for their shares, not necessarily the lowest amount possible. Graham espoused the importance of holding a diversified portfolio of stocks, increasing the odds that moneymaking stocks would offset losers. Buffett prefers a portfolio concentrated on a few stocks that he regards as excellent investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett studies the financial statements of companies to distinguish the best from the rest. He believes that top firms share certain financial characteristics. He invests only in financially self-sustaining companies with such a strong “durable competitive advantage” over their rivals that it creates “monopoly-like economics, allowing them either to charge more or to sell more.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The companies that attract Buffett’s investment operate one of three business models: “They sell either a unique product or a unique service, or they are the low-cost buyer and seller of a product or service the public consistently needs.” Firms that sell unique products include, for instance, beer brewer Budweiser, soft drink producer Coca-Cola and candy maker Hershey. Many other companies sell beer, soda and chocolate, but they lack the singular brand power of Bud, Coke and Hershey’s. Examples of companies that sell uniquely branded services include credit rating agency Moody’s Corp., tax service provider H&amp;#x26;R Block, Inc. and bank Wells Fargo &amp;#x26; Co. Retail chains Walmart and Costco, and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, fit into the third type of business model: the lowest-cost provider of such staples as food and clothing or such fundamental services as transportation. Buffett favors these and other well-known companies with brands so powerful they command “a piece of the consumer’s mind.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffett reads three types of financial statements to learn about a business: its income statement, its balance sheet and its cash flow statement. He analyzes these statements individually and collectively to discern the truth about a company’s prospects and the value of its stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The income statement, issued quarterly and annually, summarizes revenue, operating costs, overhead expenses and net results, which are either profits or losses. The cash flow statement accounts for cash provided or consumed by operations, investments and financing activities over a period of time. In contrast, the balance sheet captures the condition of a firm at one point; it summarizes the state of assets and liabilities on a particular date. Buffett compares different line items on financial statements to assess the strengths and weaknesses of companies. For example, he subtracts the cost of goods sold (materials and labor) from revenue to determine gross profit, and then divides gross profit by revenue to calculate the company’s gross profit margin. A firm that reliably achieves margins of 40% or more probably has a durable competitive advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies’ operating activities generate their selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses, such as executive compensation, advertising fees and legal costs. Like many line items in financial statements, SGA expenses alone convey limited information about an organization and its likely fate. Comparisons of line items are more instructive. For example, Buffett checks the percentage of gross profit these expenses devour. Companies with stable SGA expenses as a percentage of gross profit tend to have dominant positions in their industries. In general, “anything under 30% is considered fantastic.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett avoids investing in businesses burdened by huge commitments to research and development, preferring instead companies like Coca-Cola, an industry leader that has been selling the same secret-formula beverage for more than 100 years. In some industries, such as information technology, research and development is a critical source of competitive clout. But the pace of technological change is so fast that any competitive advantage from a research breakthrough could prove fleeting. Consider the relative R&amp;#x26;D burdens of chewing gum maker Wrigley and automaker General Motors: GM constantly must invest in R&amp;#x26;D to design new vehicles, or it risks losing market share. Wrigley has been selling essentially the same popular brand of chewing gum for decades. Which company has been a better investment? By 2008, an investor who bought $100,000 of stock in each company in 1990 would have GM shares worth $97,000 and Wrigley shares worth $547,000. Buffett is not fond of heavy depreciation and interest expenses, either. Depreciation reflects the non-cash cost of wear and tear on operating assets, such as buildings and equipment. Buffett likes to invest in companies with depreciation expenses that are low as a percentage of gross profits. Similarly, he routinely seeks businesses with annual interest payments that consume the smallest possible fraction of gross profit – the less interest expense, the less debt the firm is carrying.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitable companies divide their net income by the number of their outstanding common shares to determine earnings per share, a financial metric that securities analysts widely use. However, Buffett pays more attention to net income in his appraisal of companies. He divides net income by revenue to calculate a firm’s return on revenue and, in turn, to assess its competitive position. If its return on revenue is consistently greater than 20%, the company probably has a pivotal, ongoing advantage over the rest of its industry. If its return on revenue is steadily below 10%, the firm likely operates in an intensely competitive field. Many companies have returns from 10% to 20%, and some of them represent “long-term investment gold that no one has yet discovered.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance sheet shows a firm’s assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity at a certain date. Total assets minus total liabilities equal equity. These three balance sheet components convey important information about a firm’s probable future. Current assets include cash and liquid investments as well as inventory and accounts receivable that the firm can convert to cash within a year. These “working assets” and their amounts vary depending on the company’s day-to-day operations. Cash relative to accounts receivable may fluctuate, for instance, as business conditions change. Non-current assets include property, plant and equipment, and such intangibles as franchises, copyrights and patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett likes to see a strong cash and liquid investments position paired with little external debt. Businesses with this profile are rather likely to “sail on through the troubled times.” Buffett also calculates the net amount of accounts receivable, or receivables minus bad debts, as a percentage of sales revenue; companies with a low percentage often are leaders in their industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-liability-side-of-the-balance-sheet&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-liability-side-of-the-balance-sheet&quot; aria-label=&quot;the liability side of the balance sheet permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Liability Side of the Balance Sheet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current liabilities are debts due within one year. These include accrued expenses, accounts payable and short-term loans. Other classes of liabilities include long-term debt maturing in more than one year. In general, companies with an enduring edge over their rivals are generating enough cash internally to preclude the need to accumulate large amounts of long-term debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, or the “current ratio,” is a common measure of corporate liquidity. In conventional analysis, a current ratio of more than one indicates better liquidity than a ratio of less than one. But, according to Buffett, certain companies with a commanding advantage have current ratios below one because their reliably solid businesses negate the need for a big “liquidity cushion” against insolvency. Buffett applies the same argument to the ratio of long-term debt to shareholders’ equity: Some companies that lead their industries have higher debt-to-equity ratios because they use a big portion of their net income to repurchase stock or pay dividends. These two uses of earnings both affect the growth of shareholders’ equity, but neither indicates that a company is facing fierce competitive pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retained earnings represent net income that a company reinvests in its operations instead of spending it on stock repurchases or dividend payments. Retained earnings are a component of shareholders’ equity on the balance sheet; in fact, amassing retained earnings increases shareholders’ equity, or the firm’s net worth. Buffett believes companies with rapidly growing retained earnings are also likely to have a long-term advantage over their competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett runs a publicly traded investment holding company called Berkshire Hathaway that does not pay dividends to its shareholders. This policy has helped Berkshire accumulate a mountain of retained earnings, contributing to a significant, long-term increase in the firm’s value: Its pretax earnings per share rose from $4 in 1965 to $13,023 in 2007. Buffett prefers stock repurchases to dividend payments as a means of rewarding shareholders. By buying back its own shares, a company can increase its earnings per share without actually earning more net income; as earnings per share increase, the price of the shares is likely to increase, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax liability is a major consideration. If Buffett received dividends on his Berkshire stock, he would have to pay income tax on them. Instead, he will accumulate capital gains on his Berkshire stock tax-free as long as he holds the stock. He has already stockpiled $64 billion of unrealized capital gains on his Berkshire shares and had not yet paid any tax on these paper profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Berkshire Hathaway makes long-term investments in companies with substantial, sustainable competitive advantages, it owns stocks that behave like bonds with yields that rise over time. Buffett calls these stocks “equity bonds.” Instead of a regular bond’s cash interest payments, the yield on an equity bond is the company’s earnings per share. And as earnings per share grow over time, so does yield on an equity bond. For instance, during the late 1980s, Buffett bought stock in Coca-Cola at prices averaging $6.50 per share at a time when the company had annual earnings of 46 cents per share, “which in Warren’s world equates to an initial rate of return of 7%. By 2007, Coca-Cola was earning $2.57 a share,” translating to a 39.9% return on his original investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett is a long-term investor in the stocks of companies with durable competitive advantages because “the longer you hold on to them, the better you do.” Nevertheless, three types of circumstances make selling a great stock advisable: if proceeds from the sale could fund a better investment, if the company is ceding its competitive advantage or if the price of the firm’s shares soars in an overheated bull market. If the stock price of a company is 40 times more than its annual earnings per share, “it just might be time to sell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, rather than buy another stock trading at 40 times earnings, Buffett prefers to hold on to his cash until the market settles down and great equity bonds once again become available at affordable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the Buffett style of investing requires patience, but the potential payoff is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gross profit margin&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firms with excellent long term economics tend to have consistently higher margins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durable competitive advantage creates  a high margin because of the freedom to price in excess of cost
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater than 40% = Durable competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than 40% = competition eroding margins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than 20% = no sustainable competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency is key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales Goods and Administration&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with no durable competitive advantage show wild variation in SG&amp;#x26;A as % of gross profit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than 30% is fantastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearing 100% is in highly competitive industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency is key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;#x26;D&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If competitive advantage is created by a patent or tech advantage, at some point it will disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High R&amp;#x26;D usually dictates high SG&amp;#x26;A which threatens the competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depreciation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with durable competitive advantages tend to have lower depreciation costs as a % of gross profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interest expenses&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with high interest expenses relative to operating income tend to be either:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a fiercely competitive industry where large capital expenditure required to stay competitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a company with excellent business economics that acquired debt in leveraged buyout
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with durable competitive advantages often carry little or no interest expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren’s favorites in the consumer products category all have less than 15% of operating income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest expenses varies widely between industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest ratios can be very informative of level of economic danger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In any industry, the company with the lowest ratio of interest to Operating Income is usually the one with the competitive advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;net earnings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for consistency and upward long term trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of share repurchase it is possible for net earnings trend to differ from EPS trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred over EPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durable competitive advantage companies report higher % net earnings to total revenues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If net earnings is less than 10%, likely to be in a highly competitive business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a company is showing net earnings history greater than 20% on total revenues, it is probably benefiting from a long term competitive advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-year period showing consistency and upward trend.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it maybe an indicator that products don’t need to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just sold a business or bonds (not necessarily good)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A low stockpile of cash usually means poor to mediocre economics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 3 ways to create large cash reserve.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell new bonds or equity to public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell business or asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has an ongoing business generating more cash than it burns (usually means durable competitive advantage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a company is suffering a short term problem, Buffett looks at &lt;strong&gt;cash + marketable securities + little debt to see whether it has the financial strength to ride it out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test to see what is creating cash by looking at past 7 yrs of balance sheets. This will reveal how the cash was created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inventory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufacturers with durable competitive advantages have the advantage that the products they sell do not change, and therefore will never become obsolete. Buffett likes this advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When identifying manufacturers with durable competitive advantage, look for inventory and net earnings that rise correspondingly. This indicates that the company is finding profitable ways to increase sales which called for an increase in inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufacturers with inventories that spike up and down are indicative of competitive industries subject to boom and bust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Receivables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Property, Plant &amp;#x26; Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company with durable competitive advantage doesn’t need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive. The company replaces when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows, whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Producing a consistent product that doesn’t change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca Cola, Johnson &amp;#x26; Johnson etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;goodwill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you see an increase in goodwill over a number of years, you can assume it’s because the company is out buying other businesses above book value. GOOD if buying businesses with durable competitive advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If goodwill stays the same, the company when acquiring other companies is either paying less than book value or not acquiring. Businesses with moats never sell for less than book value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intangible Assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intangibles acquired are on balance sheet at fair value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internally developed brand names (Coke, Wrigleys, Band-Aid) however are not reflected on the balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the reasons competitive advantage power can remain hidden for so long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Assets &amp;#x26; Return on Total Assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure efficiency using ROA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital is barrier to entry. One of things that make a competitive advantage durable is the cost of assets needed to get in. This is why we calculate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/how-to-asset-reproduction-value-analysis/&quot;&gt;Asset Reproduction Value&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/book-reviews/greenwald-earnings-power-value-investing-epv/&quot;&gt;EPV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many analysts argue the higher return the better. Buffett states that really high ROA may indicate vulnerability in the durability of the competitive advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E.g. Raising $43b to take on KO is impossible, but $1.7b to take on Moody’s is. Although Moody’s ROA and underlying economics is far superior to Coca Cola, the durability is far weaker because of lower entry cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, other current liabilities and short term debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay away from companies that ‘roll over the debt’ e.g. Bear Stearns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When investing in financial institutions, Buffett shies from those who are bigger borrowers of short term than long term debt.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His favorite ‘Wells Fargo’ has 57 cents short term debt for every dollar of long term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggressive banks (like Bank of America) has $2.09 short term for every dollar long term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durability equates to the stability of being conservative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Term Debt coming Due&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies lump their yearly long term debt due with short term debt on the balance sheet. This makes it seem like there is more short term debt than the real amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important: Companies with durable comparable advantages need little or no LT debt to maintain operations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much debt coming due in a single year spooks investors and can offer attractive entry points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a mediocre company in problems with too much debt due leads to cash flow problems and certain bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;long term debt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett says that durable competitive advantages carry little to no LT debt because the company is so profitable that even expansions or acquisitions are self financed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are interested in long term debt load for the last ten years. If the ten yrs of operation show little to no long term debt, then the company has some kind of strong competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett’s historic purchases indicate that on any given year, the company should have sufficient yearly net earnings to pay all long term within 3 or 4 year earnings period. (e.g. Coke + Moody’s = 1yr)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies with enough earning power to pay long term debt in less than 3 or 4 years is a good candidate in our search for long term competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT, these companies are targets for leveraged buy outs, which saddles the business with long term debt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all else indicates the company has a moat, but it has ton of debt, a leveraged buyout may have created the debt. In these cases the company’s bonds offer the better bet, in that the company’s earnings power is focused on paying off the debt and not growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important: little or no long term debt often means a Good Long Term Bet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Liabilities &amp;#x26; Debt to Shareholders Equity Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt to shareholders equity ratio helps identify whether the company uses debt or equity (includes retained earnings) to finance operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company with a moat uses earning power and should show higher levels of equity and lower level of liabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt to Shareholders Equity Ratio : Total Liabilities / Shareholders Equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem with using as identifier is that economics of companies with durable competitive advantages are so great they don’t need large amount of equity or retained earnings on the balance sheet to get the job done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if the Treasury Share Adjusted Debt to Shareholder Equity Ratio is less than 0.8, the company has a durable competitive advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retained Earning&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important indicators of durable competitive advantage. Net earnings can be paid out as dividends, used to buy back shares or retained for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the company loses more than it has accumulated, retained earnings is negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a company isn’t adding to its retained earnings, it isn’t growing its net worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rate of growth of retained earnings is good indicator whether it’s benefiting from a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is negative because it chose to buyback stock and pay dividends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more earnings retained, the faster it grows and increases growth rate for future earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;treasury stock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carried on the balance sheet as a negative value because it represents a reduction in shareholders equity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with moats have free cash, so treasury shares are hallmark of durable competitive advantages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When shares are bought back and held as treasury stock, it is effectively decreasing the company equity. This increases return on shareholders equity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High return is a sign of competitive advantage. It’s good to know if it’s generated by financial engineering or exceptional business economics or combination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To see which is which, convert negative value of treasury shares into a positive and add it to shareholders equity. Then divide net earnings by new shareholders equity. This will give the return on equity minus effects of window dressing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presence of treasury shares and a history of buyback are good indicators that company has competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;preferred + common stock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in search for D.C.A. we look for absence of preferred stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return on Shareholder equity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;d.c.a. show higher than average returns on shareholders equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If company shows history of strong net earnings, but shows –ve shoulder equity, probably d.c.a. because strong companies don’t need to retain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Expenditures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never invest in telephone companies because of big capital outlays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important: company with durable competitive advantage uses a smaller portion of earnings for capital expenditure for continuing operations than those without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare capex to net earnings, add up total capex for ten-yr period and compare with total net earnings over the same period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important: &lt;strong&gt;if historically using less than 50%, then good place to look for durable competitive advantage. If less than 25%, probably has a competitive advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stock buybacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;indicator of d.c.a. is a history of repurchasing/retiring its shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at cash from investment activities. “Issuance (Retirement) of Stock, Net”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Occasionally even a company with a durable competitive advantage can screw up and do something stupid…Think New Coke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rule here is simple: Little or No Long-Term Debt Often Means a Good Long-Term Bet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since the future is largely unpredictable, we are usually compelled to take either the current and past earnings as a guide, and to use these figures as a base in making a reasonable estimate of future earnings. If there have been reasonably normal business conditions for a period of years, the average of the earnings over the period may afford a better index of earning power than the current figure alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Outside of the field of banks, insurance companies, and, particularly, investment trusts, it is only in the exceptional case that book value or liquidation value plays an important role in security analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The book value of a common stock is usually not important, but it may be of interest where the book value is either much larger or much smaller than the market price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The book value really measures, therefore, not what the stockholder could get out of their business (its liquidation value), but rather what they have put into the business, including undistributed earnings. The book value is of some importance in analysis because a very rough relationship tends to exist between the amount invested in a business and its average earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To avoid being deceived by these devices, the investor must examine both the income and the surplus account over several years, and make due allowance for any amounts changed to surplus or reserves which really represent business losses during the period. Also…the investors should be particularly careful not to exaggerate the significance of a single year’s earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The book value of a security is in most cases a rather artificial value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During periods of depression it is particularly important to watch the cash account from year to year… In such periods the way in which the losses reflect themselves in the balance sheet may be more important than the amount of the losses themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We suggest that the property account be neither accepted at face value nor entirely ignored, but that reasonable consideration be given to it in appraising the company’s securities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“..the success of an investment depends ultimately upon the future, future developments, and the future may never be forecast with accuracy. But if you have precise information as to a company’s present financial position and its past earnings record, you are better equipped to gauge its future possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you know what the figures mean, you have a sound basis for good business judgment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ben Graham’s principle of always returning to the financial statements will keep an investor from making huge mistakes, and without huge mistakes the power of compounding can take over.” — Michael Price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The investor who buys securities when the market price looks cheap on the basis of the company’s statements, and sells them when they look high on this same basis, probably will not make spectacular profits. But on the other hand, he will probably avoid equally spectacular and more frequent losses. He should have a better than average chance of obtaining satisfactory results. And this is the chief objective of intelligent investing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When neither boom nor deep depression is affecting the market, the judgment of the public on individual issues, as indicated by market prices, is usually quite good. If the market price of some issue appears out of line with the facts and figures available, it will often be found later that the price is discounting future developments not then apparent on the surface. There is, however, a frequent tendency on the part of the stock market to exaggerate the significance of changes in earnings both in a favorable and unfavorable direction.”
Investing is both Quantitative and Qualitative: “At bottom the ability to buy securities — particularly common stocks — successfully is the ability to look ahead accurately. Looking backward, however carefully, will not suffice, and may do more harm than good. Common stock selection is a difficult art — naturally, since it offers large rewards for success. It requires a skillful mental balance between facts of the past and the possibilities of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The price of common stocks will depend…not so much on past or current earnings in themselves as upon what the security buying public thinks the future earnings will be… In the ordinary case the price of a common stock is the resultant of the many estimates of what the earnings are going to be in the next six months, in the next year, or even further in the future. Some of these estimates may be entirely incorrect and some may be exceedingly accurate; but the buying and selling by the many people who make these various estimates is what mainly determines the present price of a stock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a common occurrence to find that the true value of a company’s assets is entirely different from the balance sheet total.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An investor should recognize a very strong distinction between good-will as it appears — or, more generally, fails to appear — on the balance sheet, and good-will as it is measured and reflected by the market price of the company’s securities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is the earning power of these intangibles rather than their balance sheet valuation, that really counts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Warren has learned that time will make him superrich when he invests in a company that has a durable competitive advantage working in its favor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The place that Warren goes to discover whether or not the company has a ‘durable’ competitive advantage is its financial statements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When Warren is looking at a company’s financial statement, he is looking for consistency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Warren knows that one of the great secrets to making more money is spending less money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Warren has learned over the years that companies that are busy misleading the IRS are usually hard at work misleading their shareholders as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some men read Playboy. I read annual reports.” (Warren Buffett)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When deciding whether to invest in a company, carefully analyze its soundness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that doesn’t is speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors often profit by buying securities that are selling below their intrinsic value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three main classes of security are “investment bonds and preferred stocks,” “speculative bonds and preferred stocks,” and “common stocks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An issuer’s financial strength and ability to pay determine its bonds’ safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred stocks should meet all the safety tests required of bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can profit from the purchase of some bonds and preferred stocks that do not qualify as investment grade if they are selling below their intrinsic value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privileged issues have the safety of preferred stocks, but they also have the upside potential of common stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio diversification can offset the variability of common stock prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an investor you should evaluate common stocks based on dividends, earnings and asset values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each of the elements in valuation — assets, earnings power, and growth — is useful in its own right, but the best insights into a firm’s value come from comparisons among them, especially the direct comparison between the asset value and the EPV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the EPV is substantially greater than the asset value, that difference is due to superior management or competitive advantages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t make investments into things that have a NPV of less than zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security analysis is the process of deciding which securities are sound investments. True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that does not meet these criteria is speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;common obstacles to analyst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inadequate or incorrect data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uncertainties of future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;irrational behavior of the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“in the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it tracks value”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 functions of analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Descriptive function&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collecting important facts and presenting them in an understandable manner. This would reveal:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveal strong and weak points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make comparisons with similar issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appraise for future performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Function&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;express specific judgement, by determining whether an issue should be bought, held, sold, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;common approach is to analyze company’s ability to earn and make payments to the investor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intrinsic value is the estimated valuation based on the analyst’s opinion of the intrinsic worth of the security from different source of information such as assets, earnings, dividends, growth, management, etc…
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value of a business can be analyzed from the perspective of multiple earnings (P/E ratio, “earnings power”). It is cautioned that valuing a business solely from the earnings power is very risky and uncharacteristic of wise analyst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Function&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should seek adequate protective provisions (margin of safety) in bonds and preferred stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;must be alert to the misrepresentation by accountants and management bad practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market analysis, in contrast to security analysis, attempts to forecast prices of individual securities or the action of the whole market, without referring to underlying facts about individual companies. One type of market analysis, called technical analysis, refers only to past market values in order to predict future values. A second type of analysis refers to indices of economic activity outside the market that, presumably, have some influence over security prices. Neither of these kinds of market analysis has proven effective and both essentially promote speculation over reasoned, fact-based investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic value is an important concept for security analysis. However, “intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms, it is understood to be that value which is justified by the facts…the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct…from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excess.” Although investors cannot calculate an exact intrinsic value for a given security because so many variables are involved, careful examination can determine whether the price the market quotes is appropriate. Securities that meet stringent safety tests and appear to be selling well below their intrinsic value often can be profitable investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities traditionally fall into two categories: stocks and bonds. This classification is inadequate, because it pays more attention to the form of the security than to its safety and purpose. The various types of securities may be more accurately classified into three groups, each of which has its own criteria for what constitutes a sound investment: fixed-value securities, including high-grade bonds and preferred stocks; variable-value senior securities, including speculative bonds and preferred stocks; and common stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are not automatically safe investments because of their form. Rather, the soundness of a bond investment derives from the issuer’s ability to pay, which is, in turn, based on its financial strength. Therefore, the investor who is considering purchasing a bond should ask the following questions: Is the value of the company’s business more than the value of its debts? Can the company meet its financial obligations even in the worst-case scenario, such as a recession or depression?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although no company or industry is depression-proof, two factors contribute to a company’s resilience in hard times: dominant size within its industry and sufficient earnings to cover its bond interest by a large margin. Bonds of companies that do not meet these requirements are not considered investment grade, even if the yield is highly attractive. A high yield cannot compensate for failure to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred stocks combine the limited return of bonds with the instability of common stocks. Despite these unattractive features, preferred stocks can be safe investments if they meet the same safety requirements as a bond, their margin of safety is large enough that management is unlikely to suspend preferred dividends, and the stability of the company exceeds that required for a bond investment. These stringent requirements limit the number of investment-grade preferred stocks to a very select group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income bonds, also called adjustment bonds, should be subject to the same strict investment criteria as preferred stocks. Guaranteed issues occupy a position between bond debt and preferred stocks. Prospective investors must carefully examine the terms of the guarantee and evaluate the guarantor’s financial strength. Even with fixed-value investments, investors should periodically evaluate their holdings. There is no such thing as a permanent investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many bonds and preferred stocks do not meet the requirements that would qualify them as investment grade, some issues in this category may nevertheless be worth purchasing, because they are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Investors must take care to avoid issues that are selling at a discount for other reasons – for example, because the company is financially unsound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid compromising the assumed risk for an increased reward to minimize the loss of principal
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if risk is assumed, it should be in the form of paying a cheaper price (therefore lowering the principal required to acquire the security), instead of accepting a higher coupon or dividend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safety is measured by the ability of the issuer to meet obligations - not by contractual rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in theory, if a business fails, the bond holder recovers his money from assets; but that often fails because:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;property values shrink when the business fails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is difficulty in establishing legal rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are inherent delays in receivership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to avoid trouble is better seeking protection after it occurs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt should bed assessed from the cashflow statement
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“good” debt is when company is using financed capital for an opportunity or expansion that might require a quick entry to the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“bad” debt is when the business is required to borrow in order to sustain operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds should be bought on their ability to withstand a depression or recession; relative safety is found in companies of a) dominant size, and b) substantial margin or earnings over bond interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presumption of safety based upon either the character of the industry or the mount of protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investor should look for industries least likely to be affected by a depression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment practice recognizes importance of character of the industry. &lt;strong&gt;historically some industries and public utilities have been more stable than others, and equally their degree of stability has altered with time&lt;/strong&gt;. This changing dynamic must be considered when assessing an organization’s ability to continue meeting future payments on fixed income securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depression performance as a test of merit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various causes of bond collapses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;excessive funded debt of utilities: defaults were causes by over-extended debt, not by lack or earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stability of railroad earnings overrated: such as diminished earnings a failure to recognize changes in transportation methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unavailability of sound bonds no excuse for buying poor ones. The investor should never be tempted by the lack of a good opportunity to venture into a poor one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are 2 incorrect theories:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that issuing a bond is a statement of financial weakness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds are only issued when companies cannot issue stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proper theory of bond financing: A reasonable amount of funded debt is an advantage (typically rooted in the company’s ability to take their product or service to market quickly). if the company need to issue debt to simply pay their bills and expenses, this is a signal that the bond is unsafe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;significance of the foregoing to the investor: whenever there is money available to invest, it is invested. when higher yielding securities disappear from the market place, analysts need to accept a lower yielding security to ensure the protection of principal instead of choosing more yield in a second rate issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;unsound-to-sacrifice-safety-for-yield&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#unsound-to-sacrifice-safety-for-yield&quot; aria-label=&quot;unsound to sacrifice safety for yield permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Unsound to sacrifice safety for yield&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lack of safety is not compensated by a high dividend or coupon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no mathematical relationship between yield and risk: prices and yields often depend on popularity. Graham suggests that the public’s familiarity with the issuing company and its ability to be quickly sold on the market is a considerable factor in the market price of bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the factor of cyclical risks: an insurance company spreads risk over a large field; the investor has only a small field and cannot afford a program entailing a small sample size with large risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk and yield are incommensurable. Graham mentions, yet again, that the analyst should not pay a par value for a risky bond that has a high yield. Instead, he should pay a considerable discount below the par value, therefore minimizing his risk of principal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reversal of customary procedure recommended: don’t start with inspecting the safest fixed income issues on a list and work down. Instead, start with the security that represents a minimal threshold of safety and work up on the list. This way the analyst protects themselves from going deeper into the list - likely resulting in the purchase of an unsafe issue.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Graham recommends the implementation of similar rules and regulations that savings banks use for fixed income investments, since they are required and obligated by law to minimize their expose to risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham recommends New York Savings Bank as the baseline, but the rules should be regarded loosely and amended if new metrics prove more useful and secure&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obligations of foreign governments
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham agreed with the decision to disallow the purchase of foreign bonds for the following reasons:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the factor of political expediency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the foreign trade argument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the individual record argument: it is suggested some countries are more creditworthy than others. Graham argues that only Canada, Holland, and Switzerland demonstrated “unquestionable investing ratings” during his era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two-fold objection to purchase foreign government bonds. Generally speaking, foreign bonds should be avoided for 2 reasons
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the basis for obtaining credit is fragile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the past performance is unsatisfactory. Graham then provides Canada as the sole exception to his doubts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds of foreign corporations: in theory no company should do better than country in which it is located because the government could simply declare state ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small companies and small municipalities are vulnerable and their bonds should not be considered suitable for the conservative investor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NYSB critera example. Municipal bonds required a population of 10000 in adjacent states and 30000 elsewhere; railroads had to have 500 miles of track and annual operating revenues of 10 million nominal dollars, etc…
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham agrees that the issuer should be of reasonable size, and he also suggests that the underlying theory of cash flow and ability to repay the holder of the security is more meaningful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial bonds and factor of size: Graham feels these bonds are safe if tested against strick standards. He recommends limiting selections to the six largest corporations in any particular industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;large size alone no guarantee of safety, the size should not be applied to municipalities and utilities, but only to industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NYSB only accept public utility bonds only when secured by mortgages. An exception is made for unsecured railroad and income bonds if earnings and dividend records meet severe stipulated rules. Graham argues that the company’s ability to meet its obligations is the top consideration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;income bonds in weaker position than debentures. Debentures are required to make payments; where as income bonds are not required to make payments. As a result, Graham believes the mandatory coupon payment for a debenture provides less risk to the holder than an income bond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;standards of safety should not be relaxed because of early maturity. If 2 different bonds, a short term and a long term, are issued and secured by the same company. The risk is no different for either bond if the short-term issue can’t be paid at maturity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the investor should ensure the issuer of the bond has a long record of financial stability and should avoid those which do not have a history of success. NYSBs requires 10 years history of payments on issues from other states and 25 year history from municipalities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investor should not take higher return for risk, instead they should pay a lower principal. For examples, when a municipal government issues new bonds at higher interest rates, because of the risk of default, the investor should be skeptical of such investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strict quantitative tests would focus on population size, the revenues received and current liabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dividend record not conclusive evidence of financial strenth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance sheet and income statement provide better clues about a company’s ability to meet future coupon payments than historical dividend performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if dividend is withheld or reduced to the common shareholders, the health of bond may be in jeopardy&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safety of a bond can be evaluated by comparing the company’s earnings to its interest obligations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total deduction or “Over-all” Method
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests that all bonds are dependent on each other, he expects all issues to fail if the payment of one cannot be completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coverage ratio = earnings / total interests on all issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minimum requirements for earnings coverage. It’s different for each industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;period comprised by the earnings test. NYSB assesses the 5 previous years for determining the safety of an issue. Graham suggests that the most recent years are the most important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the relation of the coupon rate to earnings coverage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effect of coupon rate on safety: good companies fetch lower interest rates compared to risky companies. This means that good credit produces better credit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effect of rise interest rates on safety
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the investors considers a rise in interest rates probable, he should not buy long-term low coupon bonds, no matter how strong the company. inversely, if an investor considers a drop in interest rates, he should buy long-term bonds that meet significant levels of safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the soundness of the bond rests on the ability of the issuing corporation to support its financial obligations, and much less on the potential value of its property for a lien. With that in mind, there is no purpose in devising a minimal pledged level of property value to support the bond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;special types of obligations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;equipment obligations&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equipment trust certificates may be issued against specific items of use by the corporation, for instance, again, a car. Although these certificates promise safety at time of sale, the debtor may only receive 50% of what he expects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;collateral-trust bonds&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these are bonds that are secured by common stock or other bonds, often of the same corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these bonds offer very little security if issued from the same corporation or subsidiary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real estate bonds&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the value of the property is often directly related to the success of the corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;property values and earning power closely related. Graham forcefully cautions investor that this is not true for buildings that were erected for special purposes and manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;misleading character of appraisals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abnormal rental used as basis of valuation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt based on excessive construction costs: over-valuation led to over-building which raised construction costs. When the market caught up, the loan against the expensive costs could not be supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weakness of specialized buildings such as hospital or factory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;values based on initial rentals misleading: rentals obtained on a new building are higher that can be obtained for an old building. The duration of the bond issue needs to account for a declining premium for rent due to the age of the building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suggested rules of procedure
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for single family dwellings, the lender should be sure the amount lent is not more than two thirds the value of the property as determined by the market assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the lender should fully understand the costs associated with constructing the property and not exceed the mortgage by 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there should be conservatively structured income account that accounts for vacancies and a building that doesn’t fetch the premium of a newly constructed property. This account should demonstrate quality coverage over the net income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some senior securities carry certain privileges that make them attractive purchases on a speculative basis, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Convertible issues” – In certain cases, investors can exchange convertible issues for common stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Participating issues” – Investors can receive part of any increased dividend that common stockholders earn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Subscription-warrant issues” – These include option warrants to purchase common stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These issues combine the increased safety of a senior security and the possible price appreciation of common stock. However, as with bonds, the attractive form does not mean that all securities of this type are safe. Only a limited number of such issues meet investment-grade safety requirements; the remainder belong to the same category as common-stock investments, because they share that category’s speculative features. When evaluating privileged issues, consider the amount of the profit-sharing benefits per dollar invested, the proximity of the event that will trigger profit-sharing advantages and the duration of the privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common stocks, as a class, are much more speculative than senior issues. Yet they are important to the US financial system, and novice and expert investors alike eagerly follow their prices, so security analysts know how to deal with them. The false belief that common stocks were a good buy at any price – as long as the company’s earning trend was positive – partly fueled the crash of 1929. Clearly the practice of making common-stock investments safer deserves further analysis, because the possibility of significant price appreciation will always lure investors to this type of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the instability of common stock prices makes any given organization a dubious investment, portfolio diversification can offset this risk to some extent. Investors should subject their common stocks portfolios to thorough analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty regarding future growth is usually the main reason why value estimations based on present value calculations are so prone to error&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theory-of-common-stock-investment&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#theory-of-common-stock-investment&quot; aria-label=&quot;theory of common stock investment permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;theory of common stock investment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment in common stock is often speculative and analysis may be inconclusive and unsatisfactory.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;common stock are of basic importance and of enormous interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the owners of the common stock with to know their value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;human nature often masks logic behind an endless cycle of greed for profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;history of common stock analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: over the previous 30 years (from 1910-1940), common stocks have become more favored due to their substantial earnings and dividends. With more and more companies providing detailed financial information, investors have had statistical data to substantiate their investments. During 1927-1929, Graham says most investors neglected this analysis and simply purchased more common stock based on speculative greed for profit and prophecy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;analysis vitiated by 2 types of instability&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests 2 types of instability will destroy the analysis of common stock:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instability of tangibles aspect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an enormous importance placed on intangible aspects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a company’s market price was generally stable and predictable if the companies had the following characteristics:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the company paid a reasonable and consistent dividend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings were stable and averaged a substantial margin over dividend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each dollar of market price was backed by actual assets of equal value on the balance sheet - Or in other words, the book value was similar to the market price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prewar (WW1) conception of investment in common stocks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prior to the world war, the analyst was primarily concerned with finding common stocks that paid consistent dividends and possessed stable earnings. In general, most emphasis was placed on past performance and little on future earnings growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speculation characterized by emphasis on future prospects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;technique of investing in common stocks resembled that for bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buying common stocks viewed as taking a share in a business
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a businessman were going to purchase an entire company outright, he would likely start with the net worth of all the assets (or equity on the balance sheet), and then consider if the choice produced adequate earnings for the price. After looking at the earnings that the company produced, the investor would decide if he was willing to pay a premium or discount to that par value (or book value)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the new era theory&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during the roaring 1920’s, there’s idea that value of common stocks was completely dependent on what it will earn in the future. This new thesis had three supporting insights:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dividend holds little emphasis on the value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the relationship between asset value and earnings power had little significance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the past earnings were of little significant value except when signifying momentum in growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cases for this changed viewpoint&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in short, Graham thinks that the drastic change in common stock valuation stemmed from unpredictable results often seen from using historical data and the irresistible potential for profits that had occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the early 1930’s many liquidations occurred. These events often produced very little value for the fixed assets the companies had listed on their balance sheets. This experience also caused investors to abandon the emphasis on book value or net-work of assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;attention shifted to the trend of earnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the common stocks as long term investments doctrine&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;few key points
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the value was based on what the common stock could earn in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good common stocks have a rising earnings (or EPS)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what it excludes is the idea that a price is associated with the earnings one can expect to receive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relies on an improvement in the stock’s future performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore making the approach &lt;strong&gt;speculative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new era investment equivalent to prewar speculation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stocks regarded as attractive irrespective of their prices&lt;/strong&gt;: non-sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment trusts came to resemble this new doctrine
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analysis abandoned by investment trusts. Graham voices his disgust for the professional investor who didn’t safe guard the capital of their customers due to a lazy assessment of facts and risk analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a sound premise used to support an unsound conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 1924, a book by the name of common stocks as long-term investments, by edgar lawrence smith was published. the premise of the book is that common stocks outperform bonds because not all the earnings are paid to the owners as dividends. This retained earnings by the company makes the value of the common stock increase in market price. Although Graham agreed with the basic tenants of Edgar’s thesis, he strongly disagrees with the exaggeration many investors took in their application of his ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;average vs trend of earnings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests that earnings trends and earning averages are nothing more than speculative tools for analysts to predict future results. In fact, companies that have accelerated growth demonstrate an untapped market for more competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-general-approaches&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#three-general-approaches&quot; aria-label=&quot;three general approaches permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;three general approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;secular expansion as basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a diversified portfolio of common stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when recessions occur, the investor can still benefit in the common stock markets by 1) diversifying their portfolio, and 2) by adamantly rejecting common stocks trade for excessive premiums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham says the investor cannot rely on historical earnings growth to provide safety and profit in the long haul. Specifically, he’s talking about companies that are commonly referred to as “growth picks”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;individual growth as basis of sections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use quantitative and qualitative factor to determine the value of common stocks similarly to the techniques for bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are growth companies?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe a company whose earnings move forward from cycle to cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe company’s earnings grow at a faster rate than the general market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can investor identify them?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no, typical investor can’t realistically determine when and where the company’s growth will eventually subside. As a result, there’s a strong chance that the investor might select the stock “at the top of the earnings wave”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does the price discount the potential growth?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s difficult to determine the price to pay for the future earnings that haven’t been demonstrated yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s impossible to predict how much longer the earnings growth is going to take place. One thing almost everyone can agree is that high earnings growth (like 30%) is temporary and not sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;may such purchases be described as investment commitments
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can thorough analysis and thought go into the selection of the growth stock.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe yes, as some growth investors do conduct themselves appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is the price paid for the investment something that a reasonable person would pay if they could buy the whole business?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a person is willing to pay more than 20% more for a common stock than he would for outright ownership of the entire business, the pick become speculative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;utilize even more effort than bonds to assess the future outlook of common stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;selection based on margin of safety principle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;factors complicating efforts to exploit general market swings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;index of leading stocks were selected and analyzed as a group (like the S&amp;#x26;P 500). Also a base or normal value for the group of stocks could be determined by taking their average earnings and capitalizing them at the going long term interest rate (like the 10 or 30 year federal bond). This is where Graham tell analysts that the intrinsic value of stocks is directly tied to interest rates.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this approach has 3 drawbacks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first, the general market patterns may be anticipated, but the actual buying and selling points may still be chosen poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market behavior may change in the future and not response in the same manner as before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this approach requires a very determined and vigilant individual because his actions will be the opposite of human psychology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the undervalued individual issue approach:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;likelihood of finding an individual common stock that possess the qualitative factors and the quantitative factors (compared to price) is rare. if this type of stock issue is found, Graham says it should be classified as an investment and not speculation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham says the most important way to view the purchase of a common stock is if the investor could purchase the entire business at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Dividends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before investing in a common stock, investigate both the firm’s dividend rate and its history of paying dividends. The dividend rate is important, because a dollar of surplus earnings is worth more to the investor when the company chooses to pay it as a dividend instead of reinvesting it in the business. Generally, companies that pay higher dividends have higher stock prices. However, management can suspend common-stock dividends at any time, so it is important to view the company’s dividend history as an indication, but not a guarantee, of future income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extraordinary stock dividends&lt;/strong&gt; (stock splits), on the other hand, are largely illusory, because they give investors nothing they did not already own. An improvement on this practice is for companies to pay periodic stock dividends, representing a return to the shareholders of surplus earnings reinvested in the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although stock dividends and stock splits create no real value for the holders, much speculation about the value of the companies after the division is likely to occur due to the cheaper price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;periodic stock dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with a periodic stock dividend, the shareholder often receives a smller and reasonable stock dividend that adds value over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company should not provide a periodic stock dividend if the amount exceeds the funds being retained in earnings. The dividend could eventually exceeded the company’s ability to retain earnings power and the EPS slowly declined over a 10 year period, along with the market price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests the dividend should be dispersed as a preferred share.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it doesn’t weaken the capital structure of the business like the common stock dividend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows the company to retain earnings until a safe and manageable surplus is realized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this technique gives management flexibility and control to pay the dividend as long as they choose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once the retained earnings have been distributed, the obligation is no longer on the books once the preferred share is repurchased by the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham suggests that the market price of common stocks will perform similarly if management pays a healthy and sustainable dividend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;established principle of withholding dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham claims that 2 companies with the same general business model and the same earnings will trade at different prices if the dividend policy is different. The market will value the company with the higher dividend more favorably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should a company pay a lower dividend in order to create stability for the owner with an assured payment, or should they pay a higher dividend and meet its obligation irregularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the merits of “plowing back” earnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’re 2 reasons retained earnings is beneficial to the stock holder.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whatever good for the company was good for the shareholder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company that retained earnings had more agility to remain competitive in difficult markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a company sustains a favorable ROE over a long period of time, it means the management is properly investing the retained earnings and adding value to the shareholder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dividend policies arbitrary and sometimes selfishly determined&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests that many board members are executives and friends of executives with very large portion of shares. As a result, they might want to minimize their personal tax burden by receiving smaller dividends from the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leadership may seek a larger and more impressive sized business, therefore, using retained earnings to full fill their pursuit of an ever growing business (which may or may not add more earnings)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;management may seek the opportunity to purchase outstanding shares at lower prices with the retained earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a management that pays a small dividend is able to pay excessive salaries to executives and top level employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;arbitrary control of dividend policy complicates analysis of common stocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;suggested principle for dividend payments&lt;/strong&gt;: Graham holds the strong opinion that a company should pay a large portion of their earnings to the shareholders. He says it’s more important for the shareholder to receive non-standard (or inconsistent) dividend rates at a higher return, instead of a lower and more consistent dividend, which likely results in the company accumulating reserves that add little value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-earnings&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2-earnings&quot; aria-label=&quot;2 earnings permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. Earnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze earnings, carefully study the company’s income statement. While earnings are undoubtedly important, security analysts have accorded them too much weight in calculating a company’s investment soundness. Management can manipulate a company’s earnings many ways. Therefore, always examine the firm’s income statement with a critical eye. For example, businesses can engineer nonrecurring charges and profits to produce a favorable earnings trend. A firm’s accountants also can generate perceived earnings by lowering or increasing the company’s reserves, or by reporting subsidiaries’ results in different ways. Companies can also present depreciation and amortization costs in a misleading manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors must pay attention to more than current earnings. They should consider both the earnings trend and the long-term earnings average – preferably seven to ten years, putting more weight on the latter number. The analyst’s job is not predicting the future of a trend or intuiting possible price changes; it is making decisions based on facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;analyst should combine the information from the balance sheet and income statement to garner the best valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;disadvantages of sole emphasis on earning power&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings statement has more variability than the balance sheet and therefore changes the value of the business making it appear unstable, the income statement can be more misleading than the balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;simplified statement of Wall Street’s Method of appraising common stocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;price = Current Earnings Per Share (EPS) x Quality Coefficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how does quality coefficient is determined?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probably by whole host of factors such as dividend rate, history, size and reputation of the business. Graham suspects all these factors are dwarfed by the real factor, which is earnings trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;earnings not only fluctuate but are subject to arbitrary determination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some of the techniques management can use to misrepresent earnings in the short term are the following
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through allocating items to surplus (on the balance sheet) instead of revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through misrepresented amortization charges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through an amendment of the capital structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through the use of large capital funds for items that don’t pertain to the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;significance of foregoing to the analyst&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the end, the analyst should be able to answer 3 questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the true earnings for the period studied?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what indications does the earnings record carry as to the future earning power?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what standards should be applied to the income statement to arrive at a reasonable valuation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;criticism and restatement of the income account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the analyst will need to pay close attention to the ambiguous way the account rules can be applied
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-recurrent profits and losses. This is a one-time or highly infrequent profit or loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operations of subsidiaries and affiliates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reserves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general observations on the income account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accounting rules permit management a range of choices in recording non-recurrent and special items, selecting between income and surplus, such items may be:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;profit or loss on sale of fixed assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;profit or loss on sale of marketable securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discount or premium on retirement of capital obligations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proceeds of life insurance policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tax refunds and interest on refunds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gain or loss from litigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extraordinary write down of inventory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extraordinary write down of receivables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cost of maintaining non-operating properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the above items must be separated from the ordinary operating results to indicate earning power clearly (what the company might be expected to earn if the business condition remained similar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non-recurrent items: profits or losses from sale of fixed assets&lt;/strong&gt;: these are not to be shown in current net income, they should appear in the surplus account&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;profit from sale of marketable securities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;must be separated from ordinary operating results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;methods used by investment trusts in reporting sale of marketable securities: over-all changes in principal value are the only measure of an investment trust’s performance, and this cannot be equated with recorded earnings of an industrial corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;profits through repurchase of senior securities at a discount&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a corporation may buy back its own securities at less than par value; any gain made is non-recurring and should be recorded as such. This was a feature of depression years 1931-33&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as inventory losses are directly related to the conduct of the business, Graham suggests that it should not be treated as extraordinary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;manufactured earnings&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one example such as receivables and inventory written down to an artificially low “cost price”, which in turn will lead to a manufactured higher profit in the year to come. This illustrates the most vicious type of accounting manipulation: taking sums out of surplus, and then reporting these same sums as income in the following years. The danger of this accounting method is the public is not likely to recognize it, and even the expert analyst might have a hard time detecting it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reserves for inventory loss&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companies continuously set aside reserves to absorb losses on inventory before they occur. The implication is that the income statement does not always reflect inventory losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;other elements in inventory accounting&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the standard procedure is to take inventory at the close of the year measured by the lowest of either cost price or market price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last-in, first-out: measure the actual amount paid for the most recently acquired inventory. The theory behind this method is that a merchant’s selling price is related mainly to the current replacement price or the recent cost of the article sold. This method may be useful to reduce income tax, if there is inventory fluctuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the normal stock or basic-stock inventory method: a more radical method of minimizing fluctuations is the company must possess a certain physical stock of materials from year to year. This “permanent stock” would therefore keep the same value and not be imposed to any changes in price. In order to permit the base inventory to be carried at an unchanging figure on the balance sheet, the practice is to mark it down to a very low unit price, so low that it should never be necessary to reduce it further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;idle-plant expense&lt;/strong&gt;: the cost of carrying non-operating properties is almost always charged against income, Graham suggests it should not. By doing so, it’s misleading to the expenses of the company’s core product or service. The analyst may properly consider idle-plant expense as belonging to a somewhat different from ordinary charges against operating income, as these expenses by nature are not part of the company’s normal operations.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in theory, these expenses should be temporary since the management can terminate these losses at any time by disposing of the property. therefore, if the company chose to spend the money, Graham does not deem it logical to consider these assets equivalent to a permanent liability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deferred charges&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a business sometimes incurs expenses which are applicable to a number of years rather than a single 12-month period such as:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organization expense (legal fees, etc…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moving expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;development expenses (for new products, processes, for opening up a mine, etc…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discount on obligations sold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the company is allowed to spread these types of costs over an appropriate period of years (5 years is a customary period of time). It is entered upon balance sheets as a deferred charges, which is written off by annual charges against earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is incorrect to write off these types of expenses in a single year, and against a ‘surplus’ as net income for coming years would be overstated, followed from the understated operating expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amortization of bond discount&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the discount should be amortized over the life of the bond by an annual charge against earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the write-offs could be written against surplus to eliminate future annual deductions from earnings, and in that way to make the shares appear more valuable. This practice has aroused considerable criticism in recent years both from NYSE and from S.E.C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Earnings of subsidiaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if parent company has an unprofitable division, its losses must be shown as a deduction from normal earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;flagrant example of padded income accounts&lt;/strong&gt;: on rare occasions management would include earnings in the income statement that have no existence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;balance sheet and income-tax checks upon the published earnings statements&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to check upon the reliability of the published earnings is to look at the amount of federal income tax accrued. The taxable profit can be calculated from the income-tax accrual, and this profit compared in turn with the earnings reported to stockholders. The two figures should not necessarily be the same, since the tax laws may give rise to a number of divergences. However, the wide differences should be noted and made the subject of further inquiry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one cannot make a quantitative deduction to allow unscrupulous management; the only way to deal with such situations is to avoid them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subsidiary companies and consolidated reports&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consolidated reports occur when an enterprise controls one or more operational subsidiaries so that it can disclose companies financial reports as a ‘group’ or one entity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the important part for consolidation is to ensure nothing is counted twice, for example, the profit of the subsidiary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;special dividends paid by subsidiaries&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parent companies can supplement their earnings through special dividends paid by their subsidiaries. This can be very misleading to an analyst and they need to account for this in their evaluation process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;broader significance of subsidiaries’ losses&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should a subsidiary’s losses be represented on the parent company’s earnings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should the analyst discount the value of parent company if they own an unprofitable interest in another company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is clear from the standpoint of proper accounting that as long as a company continues to control an unprofitable division, it’s losses must be shown as a deduction from normal earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the amount involved is significant, the analyst should investigate whether or not the losses may be subject to early termination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the analyst may consider all or part of subsidiary’s losses equivalent to nonrecurring items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;leading questions relative to depreciation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a capital asset has a limited life, provisions must be made to write off the cost of the asset by charges against earnings distributed over the period of the assets life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;three complications arise
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accounting rules may permit a value other than cost to acquire the asset as the basis for amortization charges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are numerous ways company can execute their depreciation/amortization charges from the balance sheet to the income statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes account rules allow companies to make depreciation charges which don’t represent the reality of assets depreciation over time. This makes the analysts job very difficult to assess capital expenditures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depreciation base other than cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham suggests substitute the replacement value of all the fixed assets at a given date, while everything prior is depreciated according to current accounting standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in most cases, companies don’t place much interest in ensuring their depreciation charges are representative of their assets’ ever-changing replacement costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mark-downs to reduce depreciation charges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham believes that excessive write-downs of fixed assets are inexcusable and should not be condoned by the accounting profession. Accountants should refuse to certify a report containing such mark-downs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;balance sheet-income account discrepancies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prevalent in the case of mining and oil companies, is to mark up fixed assets and then fail to increase the correspondingly depreciation charges on the income statement. This is done to benefit from the higher valuation in their balance sheet, without accepting the burden of consequently higher depreciation charges against net income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the vast majority of industrial companies follow the standard policy or charing an appropriate depreciation rate against each class of depreciable assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the analyst knows that a company’s depreciation policy differs from the standard, there is special reason to check the adequacy of the allowance. Comparison with a company in the same field may yield significant differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;depreciation charges often an issue in mergers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;concealed depreciation such as understate depreciation, hence overstating the earnings power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amortization charges of oil and mining companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depletion charges of mining companies&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depletion represents the using up of capital assets by turning them into products for sale. It applies to companies producing metals, oil and gas, sulphur, timber, etc… As the holdings, or reserves, of these products are gradually exhausted, their value must gradually be written-off through charges against earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;independent calculation by investor necessary&lt;/strong&gt;: in mining, the investor must ordinarily compute his own depletion allowances for his share of the mining property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depletion and similar charges in the oil industry:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the oil industry depletion charges are closer related to the actual cost of doing business. Large oil producer normally spends substantial sums of capital each year on new leases and new wells. This is needed to make up for the shrinkage of reserves throughout continued production. In general, depletion charges are cash outlays for the purpose of maintaining reserves and production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham then provides an assessment of how some oil companies would misrepresent the actual life time of the asset by extending or shortening the depletion and depreciation of their assets. This was typically exercised so the company could control the market price through earnings manipulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the meaning of these variations to the analyst and the investor&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analyst should seek to apply a uniform and reasonably conservative rate of amortization that reflects realities of fixed assets.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depreciation on tangible assets. This should always be applied to cost - or to a figure substantially less than cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intangible drilling costs. Capitalizing these costs, and then writing them off as oil is produced, is the preferable basis for comparative purposes and to supply a fair reflection of current earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;property retirement and abandoned leases. A loss on property should be charged against the year’s earnings, rather than gainst surplus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depletion of oil reserves. The proper principle here is that the analyst should allow for depletion based on the current market values of the oil.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of integrated oil companies, accept the company’s depletion figure as the best available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of companies that are solely or virtually oil producers, the analyst can compute what the market is paying for the total developed oil reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;other types of amortization of capital assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;leaseholds and leasehold improvements&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a lessee is renting a property at the large discount to the actual cost of owing the property - and the terms of the contract are over a long period of time - there maybe significant value to account for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oil lands are leased on a standard royalty basis, usually one-eighth of the production. Such leaseholds can be worth much more than the rental payments involved. If a company has paid money for a given leasehold, the cost is regarded as a capital investment that should be written off during the life of the lease. These charges are in reality part of the rent paid for the property, and must therefore be included in the current operating expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when leased property is improved with assets fixed by the leese, the cost must be written down to nothing during the life of the lease. This is due to the landlord ultimately owning the property and the tethered asset when the lease expires. The annual expense for this purpose is called “amortization of leasehold improvements.” Chain-store enterprises, and consequently the annual write-offs may be of significant importance in their income statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amortization of patent&lt;/strong&gt;: in theory, a patent should be dealt with the same way as a mining property; i.e, its cost to the investor should be written off against earnings during its remaining life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amortization of goodwill&lt;/strong&gt;: in modern accounting. Goodwill is continually tested for impairment, but isn’t amortized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inadequate depreciation revealed by transfer from surplus and reserves such as in the case of Brooklyn Union Gas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;variety of depreciation policies&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depreciation Proper&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Straight-line method&lt;/em&gt;: each class of depreciable property is written down by equal annual charges during the period of its estimated life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;sinking-fund method&lt;/em&gt;: the effect of this method is to make the deductions somewhat smaller in the earlier years and correspondingly higher in the later years. This is because depreciation is assumed to earn interest until the property is retired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;the over-all method&lt;/em&gt;: single annual percentage to the entire depreciable property account is used, instead of varying rates to different classes of assets. The object is to arrive at a simple approximation of the actual depreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;retirement reserve methods&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the intention of a retirement reserve is to have funds available when an asset retires. Over any long period of time, proper depreciation and proper retirement allowances should yield the same results. In reality the majority of retirement reserve policies operate simply to understate the current loss of property value and thus to overstate the earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various methods of calculating retirement reserves are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;percentage of gross&lt;/em&gt;. this method would tend to approximate a regular depreciation rate if the percentage take were adequate. Generally this is not the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;fixed rate per unit of product&lt;/em&gt;. This method resembles the previous and is subject to the same criticism. Instead of a percentage of gross product, an example used is $2.7 in depreciation for every thousand kilowatt hours sold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over-all percentage of Gross for maintenance and depreciation combined&lt;/em&gt;. By this method, the larger the amount spent for maintenance, the smaller the amount saved in a reserve for depreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;discretionary deductions&lt;/em&gt;. The annual deduction is largely based on the judgement of the management. It might be the same or varying amount from year to year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;double accounting policies on depreciation.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regardless of what method is followed in the annual reports, practically every company follows the straight-line basis of depreciation in computing its income tax. As a result, the investor must determine whether the depreciation is representative of the linear or non-linear erosion that takes place on the value of the asset over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reasons for accepting, in general, the income tax base&lt;/em&gt;. Graham presents 5 major reasons for accepting the income tax figure rather than the income statement as basis of depreciation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the straight-line basis follows a definite and logical accounting theory. If there is an excessive deduction, the Treasure Department wont’ accept it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the inadequacy of the “retirement reserve” idea in general, has been shown by the necessity in many cases of making large transfers from surplus to support the retirement reserve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since 1934, there has been an almost universal increase in the retirement allowances. This can be perceived as a strong indicator that past allowances were too small and therefore an overstatement of earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a number of state commissions and the federal commissions have now ordered companies within their jurisdictions to follow the income tax depreciation base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;instance when income tax basis should be rejected or questioned.&lt;/em&gt; while Graham in general believes in accepting income tax basis, there may be times when figures in the annual report should be accepted, or even to seek a third basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;problem indicated by hypothetical example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;typical market appraisals
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a company with a less valuable assets in terms of accounting is worth considerable more than the company with a higher value asset. This is done by a single gesture of writing down company C’s assets to almost nothing immediately upon the purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;a more rational approach&lt;/em&gt;. a more practical approach would be to include the fair value of the respective assets and add that to the cash holdings. The investor might consider which depreciation method that should be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;practical application of foregoing reasoning.&lt;/strong&gt; depreciation is not a cash outlay but deducted as an expense on the income statement. As a result, the company is reporting no income, yet the cash account continues to grow because displayed income is being off-set by depreciation charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;how to determine the proper depreciation charge&lt;/em&gt; the investor or the analyst must come up with an estimate for depreciation which aligns with the actual conditions of the business (based on the discoverable facts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;concept of expended depreciation&lt;/em&gt;. The primary reason for reducing a company’s depreciation charges is because it doesn’t properly reflect the company’s cash flow. In short, as an asset’s life continues to get older, the value that it is listed for on the company’s balance sheet will continue to decrease. As a result, an investor should see the value of tangible and intangible assets slowly decrease in value over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;long-term depreciation a form of obsolescence&lt;/em&gt;. for instance a plant may not be wearing out, but rather being obsolete due to changes in the industry and the status of the corporation. This risk is rather due to the investment and not accounting, hence it should be incorporated in the price and not in the depreciation, as it is a business risk. Therefore, the carrying value of asset should be adjusted accordingly. This value test for asset impairment should be conducted quarterly by the company’s management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;application of foregoing in determining earning power&lt;/em&gt;. for companies that are similar to a railroad, only the expended depreciation should be deducted from earnings due to maintenance, renewals and repair to a large degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depreciation on apartment and office buildings&lt;/strong&gt;. In short, the asset can’t be depreciated for more than the price that was paid to acquire it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inadequate allowance for depreciation&lt;/strong&gt;. Assets should not be written down in large amounts early in the assets life simply to make the earnings-power appear more abundant during the assets final years of life. This represents the true cash flow of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stock watering reversed&lt;/strong&gt;. This manipulation of asset value by writing the book value up and down is interrelated with the value of the stock. This would inflate the stock prices by the higher book value of the fixed assets (known as &lt;em&gt;stock watering&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the purchases’s amortization calculation&lt;/strong&gt;. Where the life of a mining property is limited, the investor’s own calculation of amortization should be deducted from earnings. He can base this on three factors 1) the price paid for the mining property. 2) the earnings before depreciation and depletion 3) the minimum life of the mine, and alternatively, the probability of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;purchaser amortization of oil reserves&lt;/strong&gt;. depreciation and depletion charges per barrel are found by dividing the estimated remaining oil reserves into the net value of the properties on the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;purchaser’s amortization of patents&lt;/strong&gt;. the question for investor is how much she is paying for the patent, when she buys the stock at a given price. This is the amount she must use for writing-off subsequent earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;general rule&lt;/em&gt;. In reality no single calculation shown above will represent stocks wholistically. For big companies it is even harder since they have a bulk of patents and intangible items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;special cases&lt;/em&gt;. In some special cases, when a company’s business primarily consists of collecting royalties on a patent or a group of patents, some finite provisions can be made. This provision must be related to the price the investor paid for his interest in the patent, and not on the book value of the patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;significance-of-earnings-record&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#significance-of-earnings-record&quot; aria-label=&quot;significance of earnings record permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;significance of earnings record&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;concept of earning power&lt;/strong&gt;: which basically the average earnings per share, should be seen over a number of years. One should notice if the observed years are all surrounded by the average. This is preferred to very volatile earnings, as repeated occurrences are more impressive than a single occurrence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;quantitative analysis should be supplemented by qualitative considerations:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;quantitative data is useful only to the extent that’s supported by a qualitative survey of the enterprise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in steel company example, while current and past earnings are one thing, Graham aims to calculate ‘normal earnings’. He suggests that national output of steel and the market position should be considered as part of a qualitative analysis. Reported earnings cannot be viewed without relative factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;current earnings should not be the primary basis of appraisal&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current earnings governs the market price of common stock prices more than the long term average. While a private business might earn twice as much as their average years, their local market price would never be purchased based on the extraordinary year of earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the market price typically corresponds very closely to the earnings regardless of the abnormalities in earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the speculative public shares vision with Wall Street it would seem logical to buy cheap stock at temporarily suppressed earnings and sell them at inflated levels created by the opposite effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;the classical formula for “Beating the stock Market”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Wall Street, the common assumption is that trends are likely to continue or persist regardless of qualitative circumstances. While the analyst, on occasion, can place pre-dominant weight on the recent earnings, rather than the average, pursuasive evidence has to be present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this strategy is not simple because the timing of the market is hard and the underlying values of stocks continuously change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;average vs trend of earnings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;attitude of analyst where trends are upward.&lt;/em&gt; If a qualitative study of company A is positive, which it often should be, the analyst should based future results on a conservative estimate of what the company are currently produce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;attitude of analyst where trends are downward&lt;/em&gt;. the analyst must assign great weight to the unfavorable trend and the reasons why. However, one can’t make hasty conclusions that this trend will persist either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deficits a qualitative, not a quantitative factor&lt;/strong&gt;: when a company reports a deficit for the year, it is customary to calculate the amount in dollars per share or in relation to interest requirements. This is not a valid approach. Instead the attention of the analyst should be directed elsewhere.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when an average is taken over a period that includes a number of deficits, some questions must arise as to whether or not the resultant figure is really indicative of the earning power. This is especially true if the company has volatile numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;intuition not a part of the analyst’s stock in trade&lt;/strong&gt;: Unless there is a reason to think otherwise, the past record is accepted as a basis for judging the future.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;analysis of the future should be penetrating rather than prophetic&lt;/em&gt;. In short, the investor should not be reliant on the company’s performance to improve in order to justify a premium price. Instead, the future results should be penetrating, with respect to the current capacity to earn and the price the market is trading the stock for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;large profits frequently transitory&lt;/strong&gt;: when capital flows into new industries, it may result in overcapacity and keen competition - dragging profits down for individual company’s in the long-haul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rate of output and operating costs&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when analyzing an individual company, each of the governing elements in the operating results must be studied for signs of unfavorable changes. Governing elements may vary, but if the analyst was assessing the general factors of a mining company, they might focus on areas like: (1) life of a mine, (2) annual output, (3) production costs and (4) selling price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the future earnings had to be supported by higher cost, it would make the current facts speculative and much riskier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;freeport sulphur company&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the learning point is that a high valuation based on future prospects is highly speculative. When the stock market moves away from sound sense and business experience, the common stock buyer will inevitable lose money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the future price of the product&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;change in status of low-cost producers&lt;/em&gt;: when analyzing the individual company one must also look at the overall cost level, and in which direction it can be expected to change.the cost price will be a determinant for the selling price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anomalous prices and the price relationships in the history of the I.R.T system:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the analysis not only showed that the current selling price was far above the value of the stock. It also showed that when there is an upper limit of earnings or value being fixed, there is usually a danger that the actual figure could be less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what happened afterwards for Interborough Rapid Transit System was that earnings indeed were non-recurrent and temporary. As earning power declined it ran quickly into severe financial problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Adjustments for changes in capitalization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;exact appraisal impossible&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prior to the bull market of 1927-1929, a price of 10 times earnings was accepted standard for measuring common stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also, the idea of basing the valuation on current earnings is absurd since earnings are constantly changing. Stock market prices are not carefully computed, but are the result of human reactions. The stock market is the voting machine rather than a weighing machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;limited functions of the analyst in the field stock price appraisal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as facts and human behavior change, the security analyst must not follow a general rule for his valuations, however, Graham proposes some limited functions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he may set-up a basis for conservative or investment valuation of common stocks, as distinguished from speculative valuations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he may point out the significance of: (a) the capitalization structure; and (b) the source of income, as bearing upon the valuation of a given stock issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he may find unusual elements in the balance sheet which affect the implications of earnings picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a suggested basis of maximum appraisal for investment&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the profits of the most recent year might be accepted as an indicator of future earnings, if (1) general business conditions in that year were not exceptionally good, (2) the company has shown an upward trend of earnings for some years past and (3) the investor’s study of the industry leaves him confident about its continued growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;note: a P/E of 20 equates to a 5% return - assuming earnings remain constant and are treated as free cash flow to the shareholder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;higher prices may prevail for speculative commitments&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*other5 requisites for common stocks of investment grade and a corollary thereof: * as 20 times average earnings is the upper limit, the purchase price for ordinary businesses should be substantially less. 12 or 12.5 times average earnings can be suggested as a necessary multiplier but not a sufficient condition.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it must be emphasized that many other factors must be present, including the financial setup, not-unsatisfactory prospects and proper management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An attractive common-stock investment is an attractive speculation. This is true because, if a common stock can meet the demand of a conservative investor, then he gets full value for his money, plus satisfactory future prospects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;examples of speculative and investment common stocks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks sold at multiple considerably more than 20 times average earnings. In other words, they all require large future growth to justify the price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks are speculative not because of the average earnings, but the speculative element of the instability of earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks that passes the quantitative tests of investment quality:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings have been reasonably stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;average earnings have satisfactory ratio to market price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;financial setup is sufficiently conservative, and the working capital position is strong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;allowances for changes in capitalization&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when dealing with past records of earnings on per-share basis, the analyst must adjust to changes in capitalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;allowances for participating interests&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when calculating earnings for the common shareholder, the participating interests must also be included. (participating interests is a new structure dividing income when it increases.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;similar allowances must be made for the effect of management contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general rule&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the intrinsic value of a common stock preceded by convertible securities cannot reasonably be appraised at a higher figure than would be justified all convertible securities were exercised in full. The same is the case if it is subject to dilution through the exercise of stock options, or through participating privileges enjoyed by other senior security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;principle of optimum capitalization structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the optimum capitalization structure for any enterprise includes senior securities to the extent that they may be safely issued and bought for investment. the practical implication of this is that, under safe circumstances, no debt leads to an inefficient use of the shareholder’s capital. On the other hand, too much debt leaves no room for an appropriate margin of safety, as the interest coverage ratio is very small and risky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this safe environment may be composed both of a working capital of no less than the bond value and other conditions. Under such circumstances, a very conservative capitalization based only on the shareholders’ equity would make the shareholders’ dollars less productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;corporate practices resulting in shortage of sound industrial bonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investors generally prefer strongly funded corporation issued bonds as these offer a wider range of choices and make the sale of unsound bonds less likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the factor of leverage is speculative capitalization structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speculative capitalized enterprises can be sold at somewhat high prices during good markets. On the contrary, the same venture might be undervalued during a depression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the real advantage, however, lies in the fact that the stock can advance more than it can decline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;speculative attractiveness of “shoestring” common stocks considered:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;practical aspects of foregoing:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;senior capital for the company should be held in preferred shares rather than in bonds, as this would limit the risk of bankruptcy during bad times, permitting the common stockholder to wait for better times (preferred shares can omit dividend payments, while bonds in general are obliged to pay out coupon payments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Analysis of the source of income.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;arithmetical advantage of low-priced issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low priced stocks offer the advantage of being more likely to appreciate than decline. Securities are found to rise more readily from 10 to 40 than from 100-400, and because of this, the speculative public would rather buy into stocks of lower numerical value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some of the reasons most buyers of low-priced issues lose money:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public may be buying lowed-priced stocks for the bad financial conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high number of shares are issued, which combined are priced higher than the actual value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insiders’s desire to dispose of their assets, sometimes resulting in rigorous efforts to persuade the unwary public to buy them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;low price coupled with speculative capitalization&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speculatively capitalized enterprises, according to Graham’s definition, are marked by relatively large amount of senior securities and a comparatively small issue of common stock. Although the common share in most cases is sold at a low price, this is not always the case, as long as the market value of common stock comprises only a small part of the enterprise value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;large volume and high production cost equivalent to speculative capital structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham shows how high production costs have the same effect as coupon payments for holders of senior securities. The simple effect is that the common stockholders have fewer earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;general principle derived&lt;/em&gt;. It can be derived from example that when the price of copper increases, there will be a higher profit increase percentage-wise for the high-cost producer than for the low-cost producer. This will be reflected in the share price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sources of income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;special phase: analysis must be conducted for the company based on the source of income from a specific asset, and not based on the general nature of the business.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;northern pipe line company&lt;/em&gt;: breaking down the sources of income for this company, it can be seen that a substantial part of the income comes from stable rental and interest earnings. This type of earnings must be evaluated based on the actual value of asset producing income. Income from bonds should also be valued on a higher basis, compared to the rather volatile pipeline business showing a negative trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;tobacco products Corporation of Virginia&lt;/em&gt;: this company was traded as a price-earnings of 10. All income came from 99-year lease given to a high-quality company that could meet the obligation without question. This made the source of income from Tobacco Products company of Virginia equivalent to a high-grade investment bond, and on this basis the company would be deemed undervalued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-asset-value&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3-asset-value&quot; aria-label=&quot;3 asset value permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. Asset Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gauge asset value, inspect the business’s balance sheet. A firm’s book value per share equals the total value of its tangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. Wall Street has almost entirely superseded the importance of asset value with earnings. Although rules of thumb for the proper ratio of market price to book value vary, you still should investigate the underlying value of a business’s assets before investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current-asset value – that is, current assets minus liabilities – is perhaps a more important number. It excludes both intangible assets and fixed assets and is, therefore, a rough approximation of the value of the company should it go in to liquidation. As a general rule, if a firm’s market price is below its liquidation value, the company has either been undervalued or it should be liquidated. Investors who can distinguish between the undervalued issues and the ones performing poorly due to fundamental unsoundness can realize a significant upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, examine the balance sheet to make sure that the company has an adequate cash position, that its current assets (exclusive of inventories) at least equal its current liabilities, and that it does not have a large amount of debt maturing soon, which could create refinancing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there should be no discount from the amount stated on the company’s books for cash and marketable securities, provided the securities are short term or marked to the market. The same holds true for property, plant, and equipment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;economic value of the assets is the reproduction costs of a new firm starting out in the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we first find the current market prices for the securities. Then we must adjust the book value of the firm’s accounts receivable and inventory up or down to get a more realistic reproduction costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is important to note that goodwill represents a prior blunder that must be ignored when calculating the intrinsic value of a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;liabilities and equity are the sources of funds that support the assets, which are the uses to which those funds are put&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there are 3 types of liabilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those that arise from the normal conduct of the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those that arise from past circumstances that are not pertinent to a new entrant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the outstanding formal debt of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we start with the reproduction cost of the assets and then subtract the first 2 categories of liabilities, we are left with the asset value of the whole enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defining character of a franchise is that it enables a firm to earn more than it needs to pay for the investments that fund its assets. The intrinsic value of a firm is either the reproduction costs of the assets, which should equal the EPV or those assets plus the competitive advantages of the firm that underlie its franchise. The initial judgment that has to be made is whether the firm currently has a competitive advantage, and, if so, how strong and sustainable it is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance sheet can provide the following guidance for the investor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shows how much capital is invested in the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it reveals the ease of stringency of the company’s financial condition; i.e., the working-capital structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it provides an important check of validity of reported earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it supplies the basis for analyzing the sources of income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;computation of book value&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(common stock + surplus items - intangiles) / number of shares outstanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;treatment of preferred stock when calculating book value of common stock&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in calculating the assets available for the common stock, the value of preferred stock must be subtracted. What Graham suggests is that we value preferred shares at par value plus back-end dividend payments and compare that to the market price. Whatever is highest (or most conservative) should be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;calculation of book value of preferred stock:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when calculating the book value of a preferred stock issue, it is treated as a common stock, as shown in the equation above, and junior issues are left out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;current asset value and cash asset value&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current asset value of a stock consists of the current assets alone, minus all liabilities and claims ahead of the issue. It excludes not only the intangible assets but also fixed and miscellaneous assets (various assets of value not related to the business, such as coin collections and artwork) as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cash asset value of a stock consists of the cash assets alone, minus all liabilities and claims ahead of the issue. Cash assets, other than cash itself are defined as those directly equivalent to and held in place of cash (such as certificates of deposit, marketable securities at market value).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;practical significance of book value&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the intention was to show the value of the business, but since it is far from reality, the carrying value (the number you can read from the balance sheet) has lost its significance. In most cases, the assets could not be sold at that value, and furthermore, the figure is not justified by the earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also, the practice of writing up the book value of the fixed property, or cutting it down to nothing in order to avoid depreciation charges has made the book value have questionable application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;even though Graham is very skeptical about using book value, he still believes that the book value deserves at least a fleeting glance before buying or selling shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a stock buyer should not that the value of the stock is completely related to the business in question, and what he gets from his money will be in terms of tangible resources. A business that sells at a premium does so because it earns large return compared to its capital. This large return attracts competition and generally speaking, it is not likely to continue indefinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham mentions that companies with high levels of intangibles might be less prone to competition, and that small companies in general are likely to show a more rapid rate of growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham examines the following ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current asset value is generally a rough index of liquidating value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a large number of common stocks sell for less than their current asset value and therefore sell below the amount realizable in liquidation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the phenomenon of many stocks selling persistently below their liquidating value is fundamentally illogical. It means that a serious error is being committed, either: (a) in the judgement of the stock market, (b) in the company’s management policies, or (c) in the stockholders’ attitude toward their property&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;liquidating value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the liquidating value of an enterprise is the money the owners would receive, in theory, if they sold all assets and paid off all debt in the company. they might sell all or part of it to someone else, or they might turn the various kinds of assets into cash. Such liquidations are an everyday occurrence in the field of private business, but not for public companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;realizable value of assets varies with their character&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in reality, a company’s balance sheet does not provide exact information about liquidation value, but it does supply useful clues and hints. The first rule is that liabilities are real but the value of the assets must be questioned. This means that all true liabilities shown on the books must be deducted at their face amount. The value of the assets, however, must vary according to the character. Cash, for instance, is worth the carrying value, while inventory might only be worth 50-75% compared to the market price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;object of this calculation&lt;/em&gt;: applying a general rule of thumb for a real-life company, it can ben seen that the stock was undervalued as it sold for less than the company’s cash holding - even after deducting all liabilities. &lt;strong&gt;The aim of using current asset value as a liquidation measure is not to find the exact liquidation number, but to establish a rough estimate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prevalence of stocks selling below liquidating value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at some time in 1932, over 40% of all industrial companies listed on NYSE were quoted at less than their net current assets. Also at that time, a considerable number actually sold for less than their cash asset value. That actually means that the owner would profit more by shutting the company down than selling equity on a going concern basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one reason for the very low valuation is the high emphasis put on the income statement. A company with no current earnings will be considered highly negative by the stock market. The seller might not know she were disposing their interest in the company below liquidation value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;local significance of this phenomenon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a common stock sells persistently below its liquidating value, then either the price is too low or the company should be liquidated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 corollaries may be deducted from this principle:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although, the low price offers an attractive opportunity to buy, such price should incite the stockholders to question whether it is in their interest to continue the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such a price should incite the management to take all proper steps to correct the obvious disparity between market quotation and intrinsic value, including a reconsideration of its own policies and frank justification to the stockholders of its decision to continue the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a range of potential developments which may result in establishing a higher market price:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the creation of earning power that moves in lock-step with the company’s assets (for instance from a general improvement in the industry or a change in the company’s operating policies)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;general improvement in the industry&lt;/em&gt;: when the textile business improved the share of pepperell increased more than eightfold in just 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;changes in operating policies&lt;/em&gt;: new lines of products, new sales methods, and reorganizing phases of production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a sale or merger, because some other concern is able to utilize the resources to better advantage and hence can pay at least liquidating value for the assets.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;white motor company was suffering heavy losses and was selling at a price lower than the liquidation value. The big cash holding was found interesting by an acquiring company, and the sales price was based on the current asset value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complete or partial liquidation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;complete liquidation&lt;/em&gt;: investors of mohawk mining company received 2.5 times the cost of shares when it was decided to completely liquidate the company. THe liquidation value proved to be identical with the current asset value, and could be directly derived from balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;partial liquidation&lt;/em&gt;: sometimes an effective higher market value can be created by partially liquidating parts of the business and distributing that wealth out to the shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;discrimination required in selecting such issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no doubt that stocks selling well below their liquidation value provides undervalued securities - and consequently profitable opportunities for purchase. Regardless, the securities analyst should exercise as much discrimination when selecting between the prospects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She can lean toward the five developments above (changes in operating policies, liquidation, etc…) if it is deemed that they may occur. Also, he can look at satisfactory current earnings and dividend, or a high average earning power in the past. The analyst will avoid companies that are losing current assets at a rapid rate and showing no sign of fixing the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bargain of this type&lt;/strong&gt;: common stocks that (1) are selling below their liquid asset value, (2) are apparently in no danger of dissipating these assets, and (3) have formerly shown a large earning power on the market price, may be said to belong to a class of investment bargains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;common stock representing the entire business cannot be less safe than a bond having a claim to only a part thereof&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the argument was that the company would have to pay coupon payments to the bond holders, while the dividend payments were unsecure. Here, Wall Street confuses the temporary consistency of income with the principle of safety. Dividends paid out to stockholders would not make the stock any safer. What is happening is that the stockholders turn over their own property. A rational stock owner would not surrender complete ownership for a limited claim and 5-6% returns on the investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;common purpose of balance sheet analysis is not to find bargain investments, but to detect financial weaknesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;working-capital position and debt maturities&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;basic rules concerning working capital:&lt;/strong&gt; for the working-capital ratio, a minimum of $2 of current assets for $1 current liabilities was formerly as a standard for industrial companies.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the second measure of financial strength is the “acid test”, which requires that current assets - exclusive of inventories - should be at least equal to the current liabilities. Failing these tests would make the security speculative and higher risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archer-Daniels-Midland company is an exception to the rule. Even though it failed the acid test, this was not a call for concern. While payables increased (lowering both the working-capital ratio and the acid ratio, as inventory increased), it represented normal seasoned practice in the industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;large bank debt frequently a sign of weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is rare that weak financial positions are created only by accounts payable. Weak financial positions are almost always characterized by the presence of bank loans or other debts due within a short timeframe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the danger of early maturing funded debt&lt;/strong&gt;: when a large bond issue is due in the near future, it can create serious financial problems, especially when operating results are unfavorable. Maturing funded debt is a frequent cause of insolvency, and can be identified from the balance sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;comparison of balance-sheets over a period of time&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a check-up on the reported earnings per share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to determine the effect of losses (or profits) on the company’s financial position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to trace the relationship between the company’s resources and its earning power over a long period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;checking the effect of losses or profit on the company’s financial position&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;taking losses on inventories may strengthen financial position&lt;/em&gt;: some losses are represented solely by a decline in the inventory account (which might only be worth 50-75%) of the carrying value)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in fact, if the shrinkage in the inventory exceeds the losses, leading to an actual increase in cash or reduction in payables, it may then be proper to say that the company’s financial position has been strengthened, even though it has been suffering losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on the basis of liquidation value, the investor in Manhattan Shirt company would actually have increased the value during the depression as a result of the company turning assets into cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;profits from inventory inflation&lt;/em&gt;: in the event of high inflation, in terms of accounting, the inventory will increase in value.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. Rubber is an example of an increase in earnings, partly made from heavy expenditures on a plant and a dangerous expansion in inventory from 1919-1920, with high inflation. The investor, only looking at the increased reported earnings, would not have found this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;long-range study of earning power and resources&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;the significance of foregoing figures&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for United states steel corporation, the effect of WWI is very clear, and has added a big sum to the earnings. The rate of earnings of hte investing capital has, however, declined in the last decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this raises the question of whether the end of the war turned the industry into a relatively unprofitable business, from a previously relatively prosperous one. It also raise the question whether it as due to the high reinvestment, which led to overcapacity and consequently lower return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the past, a stock-option warrant was something that was attached to a bond or a preferred stock, and carried privileges. It was not seen as an independent instrument and as an important part of the capitalization. Today, opinions are reversed, and it has even turned into a popular medium for speculators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a (detachable) option warrant is a transferable right to buy stock. The right can be described in detail by the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(1) the kind of stock, (2) the amount, (3) the price, (4) the method of payment, (5) the duration of the privilege, and (6) anti dilution provisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;type of stock covered by the privilege. Nearly all option warrants can be converted to common stock for the issuing company. Very few have rights that apply to preferred shares. Warrents have no right to receive interest, dividends or payments on account of principal, nor do they have the right to cash any vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resemblance to subscription “right”&lt;/strong&gt;: warrants are in many ways similar to the subscription rights issued by the corporation to stockholders in connection with the sale of additional stock. Differences occur, however, in terms of the exercised price and the time period. Subscription rights will typically always be exercised unless the stock price drops substantially, and it will generally happen within the 60 days that the rights typically run. Warrants, on the other hand, are seldom exercised in such a short period of time, as the stock purchase price is typically set higher than the current stock price at the time of issue. The duration is most often longer than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;method of payment&lt;/strong&gt;. Most option warrants require payment of subscription price in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;basis of trading in warrants&lt;/strong&gt;: option warrants are bought and sold in the market in the same way as common stocks. The standard rule of a warrant is the right to buy one share of the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;examples of warrants issued for various purposes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attached to senior securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as compensation to underwriters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as compensation to promoters and management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issued in a merger or reorganization plan, in exchange for other securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attached to an original issue of common stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold separately for cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;warrants as a vehicle of speculation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;qualitative element&lt;/em&gt;: since the value of a warrant will only materialize from an increase in earnings, the prospects of increased earnings would make the warrant more attractive than its stability, characterized as low-priced common stocks with speculative element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;quantitative considerations: importance of low price&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham feels that an option warrant has speculative attractiveness only if it possesses all 3 desirable qualities: low price, long duration, and option price close to the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dangerous device for diluting stock values.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as warrants give rights to buy stock at a given price level, when that pirce level is reached, earnings will be diluted for the common stockholder because they still must account for the cost to acquire the warrant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the original issue of common stock carrying warrants to buy additional stock does not give stockholders anything more than they would have without the warrant. Further, it violates an obvious rule of sound corporate financing. A properly managed business sells additional stock only when new capital is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cost of management: 3 items&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buyers of stock at $34 per share were asked to pay for the management in 3 ways:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the $3 difference between the price the investor paid and the price the company paid. While this money would go to the investment banker as an underwriter’s fee, in reality that premium is paid in the belief that the management was worth the difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The issue of the warrants had in effect taken value away from the common stockholder, of one-third of the appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the salaries the officers were to receive plus additional taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the 3 items together may be said to absorb between 25 and 30% of the amount contributed by the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interests of shareholders and those of management do not always coincide. Most shareholders defer to the wisdom of management without demanding their rights as owners of the business. In the case of companies whose common stocks sell for less than the liquidating value, the shareholders may be best served by the liquidation of the company, but that would put management out of a job, so shareholders cannot depend on management to make the right decision. Investors need to educate themselves about management practices and take these lessons into account when making investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, however, that “analysis connotes the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic. It is part of the scientific method. But in applying analysis to the field of securities, [you will] encounter the serious obstacle that investment is by nature not an exact science.” Still, professional analysis is “not only useful, but indispensable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is the stockholders who own the company; the officers are only paid employees. The directors are elected and virtually trustees, whose legal duty is to act solely on behalf of the business owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interests of stockholders and officers conflict at certain points&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in some situations, the management may explicitly have interests in conflict with those of the shareholders
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compensation to officers - salaries, bonuses, options to buy stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expansion of the business - involving the right to larger salaries and the acquisition of more power and prestige by the officers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payment of dividends - should the money earned remain under the  control of the management or pass into the hands of the stockholders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuance of the stockholders’ investment in the company - should the business continue as before, although unprofitable, or should part of the capital be withdrawn, or should the business be would up completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;information to stockholders - should those in control be able to benefit through having information not generally given to stockholders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wisdom of continuing the business should be considered&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;management, by definition, is reluctant to return capital to investors, even though the capital might be more useful there. The reason is resource scarcity. For example, to pay the bills when company has financial problems later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether or not the business should continue is a decision for stockholders, not management. A logical reason to consider is when the market price is below the liquidation level. After all, that means that the market is wrong, or that the management is wrong in keeping the enterprise alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;various possible moves for correcting market prices for shares:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if directors are convinced that continuation is preferable to liquidation, the reasons leading to this conclusion should be supplied. One solution to maintain the business and limit the risk for investors is a new dividend policy. The rate should be at least equivalent to the liquidation value to ensure that stockholders do not to suffer as a result of this decision to keep the business alive. A third option could be to distribute excess cash back to stockholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liquidation of an unprofitable business with substantial assets is almost certain to realize more than the existing market price. The reason is that market prices are governed by earnings; the liquidation process is based on assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;repurchase of share pro rata from shareholders:&lt;/em&gt; if capital is no longer required, it can be advantageous to distribute it back through share buyback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failure to distinguish one from another has led to tragedies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investments are bonds, outright purchases, permanent holding, for income, in safe securities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speculations are stocks, purchases on margin, for a “quick turn”, for profit, in risky issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specific standards have to be applied to give meaning to the term “safety”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an investment operation promises the safety of the principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an investment operation is one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment is founded on the past and present, speculation relies on the future to improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the investor, the future is to be guarded against rather than profit from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the speculator, he anticipates the future will be better than the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“intelligent speculation” is taking a measured risk that seems justified after analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“unintelligent speculation” is taking a risk without adequate examination of the situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safety is measured in terms of the ability of the issuer to meet obligations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that ability should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lack of safety is not compensated by high dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding trouble is better than seeking protection after it occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a sound investment must be able to withstand adversity. Enterprises that have withstood adversity may be favored by investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment for profit, where growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the investor of small means may opt to step out of his role and become a speculator. He may also opt to regret his actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term analysis indicates a scientific and methodical study of facts, which results in logical conclusions. But investment is not an exact science, and success derives in part from personal skills and chance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analyst must preserve a sense of proportion, analyze what matters and ignore what trivial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;truth seeker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are 3 types of variables used to rank stocks: fundamental, growth, and profitability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the most common variables used to select stocks are those that relate the price of the shares to some fundamental company information: share price to earnings, share price to cash flow, share price to book value, share price to sales, or share price to dividends.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is very little altruism in finance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The typical American stockholder is the most docile and apathetic animal in captivity. He never thinks of asserting his individual rights as owner of the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Modern financing methods are not that far different from a magician’s bag of tricks; they can be executed in full view of the public without it being very much the wiser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You cannot make a quantitative deduction to allow for an unscrupulous management; the only way to deal with such situations is to avoid them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Undervalued investment issues may be discovered in any period by means of assiduous search.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The investor cannot safely judge the merits or demerits of a security by his personal reaction to the kind of business in which it is engaged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An institution with securities of its own to sell cannot be looked to for entirely impartial guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Needless to say, an investor is never forced to buy a security of inferior grade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An investment in the soundest type of enterprise may be made on unsound and unfavorable terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Safety does not reside in titles, or forms, or legal rights, but in the values behind the security issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that no good bonds are available is hardly an excuse for either issuing or accepting poor ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever benefits a business benefits its owners, provided the benefit is not conferred upon the corporation at the expense of the stockholders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very frequently, the market’s appraisals are based on mob psychology, on faulty reasoning and on the most superficial examination of inadequate information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;quantitative data is useful only to the extent that’s supported by a qualitative survey of the enterprise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the stock market is a voting machine rather than a weighing machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham taught that intrinsic value can not be boiled down to a precise number. Nor was precision needed to make money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham set up the Ben Graham Joint Account in 1926. His fee was structured as 20% of the first 20% return, 30% of the next 30% return, and 50% of the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He ran an arbitrage strategy with convertible preferreds in the 1920s. He was long the preferreds and short the common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He lost 20% in 1929, after selling his shorts while holding the long positions in preferreds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believing the worst was over, Graham went all-in on value and lost 50% in 1930 (he used margin). In total, he lost 70% from 1929 to 1932!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Livermore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing rules of thumb offer simple shortcuts for investors but they hide the complex nature of markets. The rules work most of the time, but not always. The risk is that the rules become blinders to what’s going on in markets, which then leads to bad decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Livermore made and lost a fortune multiple times over. The lessons Livermore never learned: 1) by constantly trading (with leverage), you’re bound to go broke and 2) there are risks to never being satisfied with a ridiculous amount of money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40% of stocks since 1980 experienced a 70% decline and never recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twain had a bad habit of sinking money into horrible investments. He speculated on other people’s new business ventures, his own ventures, the stock market, and rather than get out, he doubled down on the losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A venture in the publishing business bankrupted him. He eventually repaid all his debts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid Twain-sized losses, investors should ask themselves how much they’re willing to lose before they invest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Meriwether&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans have a tendency to believe they’re above average — above-average drivers, above average at our jobs, above-average investors… We can’t all be above average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meriwether founded Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1994 with Robert Merton and Myron Scholes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LTCM earned 20% in 1994, 43% in 1995, and 41% in 1996. In 1997, Merton and Scholes won the Nobel Prize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LTCM ran an arbitrage strategy with a ton of leverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LTCM lost 6.7% in May 1998 as spreads between US and international bonds widened. Then they lost 10% in June. The collapse of the Russian stock market spiked short-term rates in August. LTCM was down 52% YTD, a $1.9 billion loss. From Sept. 10 to 21 they lost another $1.5 billion. The New York Fed forced a takeover of the fund before it infected the financial system. It was the largest hedge fund at the time at $3.6 billion, 40% was Meriweather, Merton, and Scholes personal wealth…wiped out in five weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their mistake was believing markets were rational and certain that math could solve it. They failed to acknowledge that the behavior of millions of participants around the globe might impact markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Bogle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bogle was promoted in 1965 to run the Wellington Group. The flagship Wellington Fund was a balanced fund created in 1928. As the Wellington fund began to lag the markets during the Go-Go ’60s, Bogle merged Wellington with Ivest, a young firm of “new era” managers, in an attempt to keep up with the times. Wellington fund would lose 40% when the Go-Go ’60s market crashed in 1969.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bogle was fired in 1974. With nothing to lose, he proposed he stay on as chairman of the Wellington Fund. His failure would lead to the creation of the Vanguard Group and the First Index Investment Trust — i.e. the index fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Steinhardt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Styles go out of favor. Portfolios hit hard times. Straying outside your comfort zone for opportunities during these difficult periods can make things worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steinhardt’s hedge fund earned a 24.5% annual return after fees from 1967 to 1995.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hedge funds were so popular in 1990s, people were begging hedge funds to take their money. Steinhardt used the opportunity to open a fourth fund — Steinhardt Overseas Fund — in 1993. Except, he had no knowledge of foreign markets, business environment, or political systems. He believed his experience trading U.S. stocks would translate over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Fed raised rates in February 1994, pushed U.S. bond prices lower but European bonds fell further. Steinhardt’s fund lost $800 million with the rate hike. He lost 29% on the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Tsai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors tend to associate gains with skill rather than bull market luck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bull markets drive investors to trade more because rising markets provide a positive feedback loop to investors. Investors trade stocks, make a little money, trade more, make more, and the trading increases…until the bull market ends. Then it blows up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The late 1960s bull market culminated with the Go-Go fund managers. Jerry Tsai was at the center of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He started the Manhattan fund in 1965, raising more money than initially planned. It had an 8.5% sales load. Tsai bought any stock that rose faster than the market. The strategy works great in ’67 earning a 40% return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tsai learned that high-flying stocks can fall faster than they rise. The market crashed in 1969. The Manhattan Fund lost 90% over the next few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endowment Effect: we put more value on things we own than before we bought them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffett made numerous mistakes over his long career, but none like Dexter Shoes. He paid $433 million for Dexter using Berkshire stock. He diluted shareholders to buy a business that was worth nothing a few years later. It couldn’t compete with foreign competitors. His Dextor purchase was likely due to overconfidence thanks to his successful purchase of another shoe company — H.H. Brown — a few years early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Ackman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We prefer to talk more about our successes than our failures — especially for investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ackman’s battle with Herbalife began in 2012 with a very public presentation claiming it was a pyramid scheme that would go to zero. He was short Herbalife and the stock immediately sold off 35%. Which provided an opportunity for hedge funds to take the other side. The stock reversed course, rising 70% higher than where Ackman began to short it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk of being public about investments is it brings ego into decision-making. Can you publicly admit to being wrong? There’s also the added pressure from others who are following your coat tails (without doing their own research) and it feeds the trolls when it doesn’t work out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanley Druckenmiller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Druckenmiller bet against Internet stocks in 1999 that cost him $600 million, an 18% loss. He ended the year positive 35% thanks to a couple of new hires who took the long side of the Internet Boom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2000 he sold the Internet stocks out of concern — he knew it wouldn’t last forever — took his gains, and went back to investing in what he was comfortable with. Yet, he couldn’t help but watch the Internet stocks continue rising and his two new hires making money, until he couldn’t stand it and plunged back in. He bought back in at the height of the bubble, then it burst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His mistake was knowing better and buying the stocks anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Ruane — Sequoia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk of concentrated portfolios is a few big losses can set you back permanently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequoia was one of the most successful funds ever. It bought Valient stock in 2010 and it quickly became its largest holding. Valient relied on buying existing drug companies, then raising the price of the drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accusations of fraud at Valient surfaced in 2015. Its stock fell 19%. Sequoia lost 9% because of its large position. Then it bought more Valient stock. It represented 32% of the fund. 8 months later, they sold all the stock. Valient was down more than 90%!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before buying a position, write down why you’re buying and your exit plan. It gives you a reference point that may help combat the endowment effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Maynard Keynes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynes’s initial foray into “investing” was trading currencies and commodities based on macro bets after WWI. It didn’t end well. He lost it all and was bailed out by family and friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He shifted his strategy to a more long-term approach after taking over the King’s College endowment fund and the portfolios of two insurance companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Paulson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paulson is most well known for betting against mortgage-backed securities during the housing bubble. It paid off massively — 590% and 350% — in one year for two funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Off the back of that success, he went looking for another huge win. He settled on a big bet on gold. It failed to pay off. In fact, it lost money three years in a row — 75% in total. Because normal returns weren’t good enough!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trouble with abnormal gains like Paulson had, is it resets our expectations of what’s possible. Normal gains aren’t enough anymore. The other issue is overconfidence in our ability to repeat the success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munger started his fund in 1962, earning a 24% annual return before fees over 14 years (vs. S&amp;#x26;P 500’s 5.2%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fund was highly concentrated. It brings the possibility of a wider range of returns in both directions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His investors felt the downside of concentration in the 1973/74 bear market. Munger lost 32% and 31% over those two years versus the Dows 13% and 23% losses respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people don’t have the stomach for such a huge drawdown. He lost a big investor because of it. The fund bounced back in 1975, then Munger liquidated it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Losses and drawdowns are part of the game. Get used to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You need patience, discipline, and an ability to take losses without going crazy.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best lesson investors can learn from one of the best to ever do it is that there are no good times without the bad times. Big losses are in the fabric of long‐term investing. And if you’re not willing to accept them, you will not harvest the long‐term returns that the market has to offer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50 percent or more two or three times a century, you’re not fit to be a common shareholder and you deserve the mediocre result you’re going to get compared to the people who do have the temperament, who can be more philosophical about these market fluctuations.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You only need to get rich once. If you’ve worked hard or just got lucky and now find yourself in the top 1%, stop trying to hit home runs, you’ve already won.”
Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Money earned by luck is indistinguishable from money earned by skill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea of wholesale shifts is for various reasons impracticable and indeed undesirable. Most of those who attempt it sell too late and buy too late, and do both too often…. I believe now that successful investment depends upon three principles: A careful selection of few investments having regard to their cheapness in relation to their probable actual and potential intrinsic value over a period of years ahead and in relation to alternative investments at the time. A steadfast holding of these in fairly large units through thick and thin, perhaps for several years, until they have fulfilled their promise or it is evident that they were purchased on a mistake; A balanced investment position, i/e, a variety of risks in spite of individual holdings being large, and if possible opposed risks.” — John Maynard Keynes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How could economics not be behavioral? If it isn’t behavioral, what the hell is it?” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every minute of every day, markets are putting out clues, little crumbs of information for would‐be market detectives. This is the most addictive game on the planet because it’s a game that never ends. The pieces are always zigging and zagging and by the time you think you’ve got things figured out, new rules are implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Professional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs…each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors… We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.” — John Maynard Keynes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we speak frankly, we have to admit that our basis of knowledge for estimating the yield ten years hence of a railway, a copper mine, a textile factory, the goodwill of a patent medicine, an Atlantic liner, a building in the City of London amounts to little and sometimes to nothing; or even five years hence.” — John Maynard Keynes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want to make big money in the stock market, you have two choices: (1) buy a lot of stocks, an index fund, for example, and hold them for a long time (even then, no guarantees) or (2) buy a few stocks and hope you’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re looking for a manager you want someone who is intelligent, energetic, and moral. But if they don’t have the last one, you don’t want them to have the first two.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your six best ideas in life will do better than all your other ones.” — Bill Ruane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Concentrate to get rich, diversify to stay rich.” — old adage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea of caring that someone is making money faster is one of the deadly sins. Envy is a really stupid sin because it’s the only one you could never possibly have any fun at. There’s a lot of pain and no fun. Why would you want to get on that trolley?” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I bought $6 billion worth of tech stocks, and in six weeks I had lost $3 billion in that one play. You asked me what I learned. I didn’t learn anything. I already knew that I wasn’t supposed to do that. I was just an emotional basket case and couldn’t help myself. So maybe I learned not to do it again, but I already knew that.” — Stanley Druckenmiller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would have been nice to go out on top, like Michael Jordan, but I overplayed my hand.” — Stanley Druckenmiller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a winner’s game the outcome is determined by the correct actions of the winner. In a loser’s game, the outcome is determined by mistakes made by the loser.” — Charley Ellis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bad things tend to happen when we compare our portfolios with others, especially if they possess a lesser IQ and extracted a higher return.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fundamentals are how fast the horse runs and expectations are the odds.” — Michael Mauboussin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The casual investor thinks a good company makes for a good stock, without giving consideration to the fact that the majority of investors share a similar opinion. Perhaps, like‐minded investors have pushed the price of a good company into that of a great company, making it less than it appears at first blush.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s my philosophy, which has been reinforced by Mr. Soros, that when you earn the right to be aggressive, you should be aggressive. The years that you start off with a large gain are the times that you should go for it.” — Stanley Druckenmiller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first thing I heard when I got in the business, not from my mentor, was bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered. I’m here to tell you I was a pig. And I strongly believe the only way to make long‐term returns in our business that are superior is by being a pig.” — Stanley Druckenmiller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ideas are part of who we are. They become like possessions. Especially publicly. I mean, flip-flopping is a bad word. I love changing my mind!” — Daniel Kahneman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I clearly made a mistake in paying what I did for Dexter in 1993. Furthermore, I compounded that mistake in a huge way by using Berkshire shares in payment.” — Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It behooves us to take a minute and think about why we’re investing and what we really know. Do you know more than the person on the other side of the trade? Do you know something that’s not in the newspaper or on the Internet? Will we know when we’re right? What about if we’re wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the game is no longer being played your way, it is only human to say the new approach is all wrong, bound to lead to trouble, etc. I have been scornful of such behavior by others in the past. I have also seen the penalties incurred by those who evaluate conditions as they were – not as they are. Essentially I am out of step with present conditions. On one point, however, I am clear. I will not abandon a previous approach whose logic I understand even though it may mean foregoing large, and apparently easy, profits to embrace an approach which I don’t fully understand, have not practiced successfully and which, possibly, could lead to a substantial permanent loss of capital.” — Warren Buffett, 1967&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Genius is a rising market.” — John Kenneth Galbraith&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“1987 had shaken me; 1994 had been devastating. It had taken a part of me that could not be retrieved.” — Michael Steinhardt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Putting too much money into something you don’t fully understand is a good way to lose a lot of money. But what’s more damaging than losing money is the psychological scar tissue that remains after the money vanishes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bad behavior is one of the greatest dangers investors face, and traveling outside your circle of competence is one of the most common ways that investors misbehave. It’s not important how wide your circle of competence is, but what is critically important is that you stay inside it. Knowing what you don’t know and having a little discipline can make all the difference in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors who confine themselves to what they know, as difficult as that may be, have a considerable advantage over everyone else.” — Seth Klarman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The important part is finding a methodology that you are comfortable with. But a methodology means something that is repeatable. It means having a process. The stock market throws far too many curveballs for you to wing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first five years you would have described Bogle as a genius. And at the end of the first 10 years, roughly, you would have said: the worst merger in history, including AOL and Time Warner. It all fell apart. Their management skills were zero. They ruined the fund they started, Ivest. They started two more and ruined both. And they ruined Wellington Fund.” — Jack Bogle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can hardly find words to describe first my regret and then my anger at myself for having made so many bad choices. Associating myself – and the firm whose leadership I had been entrusted – with a group of go‐go managers.” — Jack Bogle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The lesson we can learn from one of the most influential investors of all time is that investing is a long journey, often lasting a lifetime. It is filled with success, failure, hopes, dreams, and everything in‐between.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were able to calculate the odds of everything, but they understood the possibility of nothing. The lesson us mere mortals can learn from this seminal blowup is obvious: Intelligence combined with overconfidence is a dangerous recipe when it comes to the markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They made absolutely no allowance in the episode of LTCM for the possibility of their not understanding markets and their methods being wrong.” — Nassim Taleb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They believed the risk was low, but their leverage in both the United States and Europe soared. LTCM had about $40 million at stake for every point in volatility the markets moved. At one point, they had $1.25 trillion in open positions and they were levered 100:1. This leverage would lead to one of the largest disappearing acts of wealth the world has ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…markets don’t compensate you just for being smart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The iron rule of life is that only 20% of people can be in the top fifth.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are two times in a man’s life when he should not speculate, when he can’t afford it, and when he can.” — Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining and wants it back the minute it begins to rain.” – Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is strange the way the ignorant and inexperienced so often and so undeservedly succeed when the informed and the experienced fail.” — Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.” — Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing when speculating is that you keep your losses manageable. Paper cuts sting, but they heal. Shotgun wounds on the other hand, those are tough to come back from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got drubbed by the 1973 to 1974 crash, not in terms of true underlying value, but by quoted market value, as our publicly traded securities had to be marked down to below half of what they were really worth.” — Charlie Munger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem with small losses is that it’s easy to hold onto them as they morph into big losses. In the world of finance, nothing springs eternal like hope. We’ll watch with indifference as a 5% loss becomes a 10% loss, with fear as it cascades to a 20% loss, and with utter terror as it falls any further.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that he remained steadfast in his conviction that security analysis was a worthwhile endeavor is nothing short of remarkable. The partnership earned 6% a year from 1926 to 1935, compared to…3.8% for the Dow. Despite the hard times and enormous drawdown, Graham would continue to operate under the assumption that value investing is the most intelligent way to achieve superior results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately in this kind of work, where you are trying to determine relationships based upon past behavior, the almost invariable experience is that by the time you have had a long enough period to give you sufficient confidence in your form of measurement just then new conditions supersede and the measurement is no longer dependable in the future.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I must say frankly our studies indicate you have your choice of tossing coins and taking the consensus of expert opinion, and the results are just about the same in each case… Everybody in Wall Street is so smart that their brilliance offsets each other. And that whatever they know is already reflected in the level of stock prices pretty much and consequently what happens in the future represents what they don’t know.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s critically important to be aware of value, but it’s more important not to be a slave to it. Graham taught us that there are no iron‐clad laws in finance and that cheap can get cheaper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I wasn’t in it – or it went way down and I was completely in it. My intention was to minimize my future regret.” — Harry Markowitz on his asset allocation decision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my nearly fifty years of experience in Wall Street I’ve found that I know less and less about what the stock market is going to do but I know more and more about what investors ought to do; and that’s a pretty vital change in attitude.” — Ben Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important lesson that investors should take from the person who taught us the difference between value and price is that value investing is not a panacea. Cheap can get cheaper. Rich can get richer. Margins of safety can be miscalculated, and value can fail to materialize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You will do a great disservice to yourselves, to your clients, and to your businesses, if you view behavioral finance mainly as a window onto the world. In truth, it is also a mirror that you must hold up to yourselves.” — Jason Zweig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you are ready to give up everything else and study the whole history and background of the market and all principal companies whose stocks are on the board as carefully as a medical student studies anatomy‐ if you can do all that and in addition you have the cool nerves of a gambler, the sixth sense of a clairvoyant and the courage of a lion, you have a ghost of a chance.” — Bernard Baruch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mistakes are an inevitable part of the process.” — Peter Bernstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The lesson that investors should learn from Livermore is how dangerous rules of thumb can be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems incredible that knowing the game as well as I did, and with an experience of twelve or fourteen years of speculating in stocks and commodities, I did precisely the wrong thing.” — Jess Livermore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I kept trading – and losing. I persisted in thinking that the stock market must make money for me in the end. But the only end in sight was the end of my resources.” — Jesse Livermore, 1909&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a man is both wise and lucky, he will not make the same mistake twice. But he will make any one of the ten thousand brothers or cousins of the original. The mistake family is so large that there is always one of them around when you want to see what you can do in the fool‐play line.” — Jesse Livermore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trusted place I can easily find and look at to see additional/support information on any projects that are working on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a reliable place for ideas and tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain perspective and trust in the focus and the priorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting in-tray(s) to zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid open loops and cognitive loads in mind to remember the open loops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reference system to retrieve information within 30 seconds or less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to access the visualization of the tasks in the inbox/today/next action lists, so it’s easier for you to take action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for Zapier and build one very simple automation. It doesn’t matter which one. Maybe create some kind of reminder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for Todoist and start just putting tasks into the Inbox. Maybe create a few Projects. Install it on your phone. Practise using it to get things out of your head for a couple of weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you decide after a few weeks that you don’t hate Todoist, spend one afternoon/evening doing the Core Dump, where you just create Projects and add Tasks until everything seems out of your head. It is probably not that important to have links from Todoist tasks back to specific emails as long as you know what to search for in Gmail when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/getting-started-with-getting-things-done&quot;&gt;Getting Started from JBrains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it easy to extract the information out of the brains
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it usually takes less than 30 seconds to create the todo item on the phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;index cards can be used to write down ideas, but the items on index cards need to be transferred to Todoist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apply a label to an email, which then is picked up by Zapier action and creates a card in Trello with the text of the email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the Todoist Gmail plugin to create a task and put it in the in-tray
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://todoist.com/help/articles/use-gmail-with-todoist&quot;&gt;Use Gmail with Todoist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is probably not that important to have links from Todoist tasks back to specific emails as long as you know what to search for in Gmail when you need it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there’s an inbox item and There’s no project fit for it, it should be deleted forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a todo item from a voice command
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“OK, Google, Ask Todoist to add a task. Wash the car today.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Siri Action
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios&quot;&gt;Shortcut Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell the action’s title to Siri, and it prompts the card’s title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inbox/Task List: a combination of Todoist and 1-5 index cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;core Dump where you just create Projects and add Tasks until everything seems out of your head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/remind-yourself-to-schedule-x&quot;&gt;Remind Yourself To Schedule A Thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you choose not to document something in your inbox
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what does that choice feel like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when this happens, what do you do instead? (Keep it in your brain’s memory? Write it on a piece of paper. Something else?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why did you choose not to do the task?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forgot to think about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thought about it but never felt like I could schedule it because I had other things to do that I consciously decided were more urgent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thought about it and consciously decided, “I’ll do it later,” but then I forgot to think about it a second time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thought about it and consciously decided, “I can’t justify taking time from my schedule to do this now,” but then I forgot to think about it a second time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some other reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after deciding the reason(s) not to do the task
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move the item from your inbox into a new Project. Let this project have only one task: do it! Move this new Project up your list of Projects until everything above it is more urgent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a new recurring task called “Decide when to do (the original task).” Remind yourself once per week. If you notice that you never even decide when to do the original task, then the original task wasn’t important enough or urgent enough. &lt;strong&gt;Throw it away, and maybe it comes back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick an exact time to do the task, and then put that on your calendar. At the moment that time arrives, either you do the task, or you throw it away (and maybe one day it comes back)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apply the Todoist label next action on the task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can’t even guess the effort of a smaller next action, then maybe the next action is “Spend 30 minutes figuring out what it means to complete this project”. Maybe the lack of vision/clarity about the “acceptance criteria” makes it hard for you to know where to start.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe one next action which you can guess how long it will take—even if that next action is tiny or seems insignificant. That means moving the item from Inbox to New Project, then writing two tasks for that project:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the new, smaller next action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;figure out how to do the rest of this project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use project template GTD Weekly review from Todoist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe take 30 minutes to review?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;daily review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use embedded widgets from Todoist on phone/browser, so the tasks in inbox/next action/today can easily be viewed and acted on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify and address your limiting criteria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;context, time available, the energy available (tackle frog labels with the highest energy), and priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recommended at least 60-90 minutes daily, but I often only have 5 mins to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tasks that are hard to classify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just want to remember to have the option to do this task, but I’m OK if it waits five years.” Put it in Someday/Maybe or create a new project for it.
“I just need to decide whether to do it or not.” Set a reminder for “Decide when to do X,” or just put the damn thing on your calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe, just &lt;strong&gt;delete it, and it will come back if it is significant enough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolve the possible guilt about it. Put it out of your mind. You can do it either by deciding “I’m going to do it on a Specific date” or “I’m going to just put it in the list and I’m happy if I do it next week, next month, next year, or next decade.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when reviewing the inbox
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use Projects aggressively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if there are no projects fit for an item, delete it forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have you learned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s a refactoring to pattern exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take this opportunity to review into domain/refactoring to patterns and Arlo commits -&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jay.bazuzi.com/why-acn/&quot;&gt;https://jay.bazuzi.com/why-acn/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy I followed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stumble upon the pyramid of refactoring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/course/pyramid-of-refactoring-java-interpreter-factories/learn/lecture/17510056#overview&quot;&gt;refactor pyramid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emilybache/Necklace-Refactoring-Kata&quot;&gt;https://github.com/emilybache/Necklace-Refactoring-Kata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it turns out that it has a very good examples to illustrate the introduction indirect layer, so I have added a new example to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonytvo/introduce-indirection-layer/tree/main/pyramid-refactor-example&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tonytvo/introduce-indirection-layer/tree/main/pyramid-refactor-example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn’t realize it such a foundational patterns that allow other patterns/flow in the system to emerge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it seems like for this exercise I would lean more using these examples to update introduction to indirect layer kata, so it can be used to practice refactoring to patterns as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attempt the chain of responsibility refactoring from wlodekkr here -&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonytvo/chain-of-responsibility/pull/1&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tonytvo/chain-of-responsibility/pull/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once I finish with updating the introduction indirect layer, I will try to finish this kata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;options are about the trading - the buying and selling of risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the objective is to generate high yield income from writing/selling puts and do so while minimizing risk as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning to identify the important factors in a trade and then lining up those factors as much as possible on your side, leads to clarity - you suddenly “get” why some traders are really successful and why others struggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adopt probabilistic mindset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep diary of your trades
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s essential on learning from your past mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setup rules before entering
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setup strategy on how to exit the position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 minutes rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s best to limit yourself to 1 or 2 positions, that is, options that have not yet been sold or used - at a time. Otherwise, it’s easy to lose track of how many open positions are in play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checking the expiration date and the strike price. All of this information is located in the options chain. Many traders get into trouble here: if you enter 100 call contracts when you only meant ten or one, you have a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check the bid-ask price, which is the highest price a buyer will pay and the lowest price a seller will accept. If the bid ask spread is too wide - meaning there’s too large a gap between the two - find another stock to trade. It’s too difficult to make a profitable trade if the bid and ask prices are too distant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make sure you place a limit order and not a market order. It’s very risky to buy stocks at market price. Instead, a limit order lets you name your price, which should be somewhere between the bid and ask prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;review the stock charts one last time to confirm that your initial observations still hold true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can always take 5 minutes - especially when it will keep you from rushing into a problematic trade because of a careless mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;covered call&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for each 100 shares that a trader owns of an optionable stock, the trader can write (or sell) one call option (sell to open) against those shares in exchange for a cash premium payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the stock closes at expiration above the strike price, the call will be exercised and the trader will be required to sell his or her underlying shares to the holder of the call at the agreed upon strike price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the stock closes at expiration AT or BELOW the strike price, the call will expire worthless, the trader retains the shares, and is free to write a new covered call if and when he or she chooses to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the covered call writer may also buy back the call at any time prior to expiration (buy to close) for either a profit or a loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rolling covered calls: buy back expiring calls and sell new call with later expiration
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rolling out: rolling to later expiration and the SAME strike price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rolling out and up: rolling to later expiration and to a higher strike price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;benefits: not losing money on the roll, increases the strike price, and captures more of the cap gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drawbacks: requires longer rolls and smaller credits. Would not works when there’s big pops in stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;naked puts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy $40 put on a $45 stock, no matter how low the stock trades, you will be able to sell @ $40&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a put writer becomes the insurance company. He or she collects the premium in exchange for assuming the responsibility of purchasing the shares should the shares be below the strike price when the put expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cash secured puts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strategy: writing short-dated, at the money, cash-secured puts on high quality companies when they’re trading at fundamentally and technically attractive prices.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fairly close to expiration date (20-45 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time value component of option is highest at the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully backed with cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the biggest risk is when there’s big move lower
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;could be minimized in the trade setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what does it mean to be high-quality?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;might need to wait for the stock to be fundamentally sound or technically attractive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bull spread credit spread&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ratio call spread&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What determine the price of an option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intrinsic value: difference between the underlying price and strike price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time value
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volatility (expected/implied)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;general market conditions or mood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company-specific history &amp;#x26; events: earnings, legal/regulatory/other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time until expiration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dividends and dividend cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interest rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;option greeks:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delta: sensitivity to price change in the underlying security.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impacted by:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the strike price and share price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time remaining until expiration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the deeper in the money, the higher the delta. Inverse, the father out of the money, the lower delta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as back door predicting mechanism
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not very accurate (esp. longer dated)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delta 0.5 = 50-50 chance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delta 0.9 = strong likelihood to be in the money (ITM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the farther away expiration is, the deeper in the money you need to generate high delta. A lot can happen to share price in long time period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gamma: sensitivity of delta to price change in the underlying security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theta: sensitivity to time. The amount of daily time decay in the price of option assuming nothing else changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vega: sensitivity to volatility changes. The amount of change to the option for each percentage unit change in the underlying security’s volatility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rho: sensitivity to interest rates. The amount of change to the option for each percentage unit change in interest rates.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;systematic method to iterate through all the possible configurations of a search space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at each step in the backtracking algorithm, we start from a given partial solution, say, a = (a1, a2, …, ak) and try to extend it by adding another element at the end.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after extending it, we must test whether what we have so far is a solution - if so, we should print it, count it, or do what we want with it. If not, we must then check whether partial solution is still potentially extendible to some complete solution. If so recur and continue. If not, we delete the last element from a and try another possibility for that position, if one exists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backtracking templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;boolean finished = false;
backtrack(int a[], int k, data input) {
  int c[MAX_CANDIDATES];
  int ncandidates;
  int i;

  if (isASolution(a, k, input)) {
    processSolution(a, k, input);
  } else {
    k = k+1;
    construct_candidates(a, k, input, c &amp;amp;ncandidates);
  }

  for (i=0; i&amp;lt;ncandidates; i++&gt;) {
    a[k] = c[i];
    backtrack(a, k, input);
    if (finished) return;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isASolution(a, k, input)&lt;/code&gt; tests whether the first k elements of vector a are a complete solution for the given solution. The last argument, input, allows us to pass general information into the routine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;construct_candidates(a, k, input, c, ncandidates)&lt;/code&gt; - this routine fills an array &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; with the complete set of possible candidates for the kth position of a, given the contents of the first k -1 positions. The number of candidates returned in this array is denoted by ncandidates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have you learned?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a classic application for backtracking algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s lots of solutions but none of them really shares the approach on how to get to the solution and how to TDD it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I were a little confuse on how to mark and unmark the position we have visited, but it turns out that the simplest thing is just avoid side-effects for the currentPosition parameter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still don’t like the side-effects I have on QueenPositions to keep track all of the possible solutions on queen positions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strategy I followed?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was on my bucket list to read through these programming challenges and algorithm design manual from Steven S Skiena as it seems to have good documentation on how to design algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with smallest solution is n=4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s expensive to go through 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; true/false vector for 8x8 board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to make a backtracking program efficient enough to solve interesting problems, we must &lt;strong&gt;prune the search space by terminating every search path the instant it becomes clear it cannot lead to a solution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since no 2 queens can occupy the same column, we know that the n columns of a complete solution must form a permutation of n, this reduce the search space to 8! = 40320.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to start from the client first/intention first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid using getter (help to reasoning where to put the behavior to avoid the getter method)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to use approvals, but needs to reset the approved file whenever I need to change the test name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;here’s the PR -&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonytvo/n-queens/pull/1&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tonytvo/n-queens/pull/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;takes about 2 mins and 500MB to find solution for 12x12 board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have you learned?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems like as soon as we give Quality an abstraction, we can remove more duplication code around increase/decrease quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it seems like verifyAllCombinations is handy, but it’s not available as part of jest snapshot testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, simplify the condition to true/false after the condition is flipped to the top level then leverage ‘Alt+Enter’ to simplify the conditions as much as possible (instead of manually remove dead-code or code that is highlighted as red from test-coverage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;couldn’t get the code highlight for warnings and not-covered works as the demonstrated video from Llewellyn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it seems like for … forEach … stream is a pattern in languages that support stream/functional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a better and easier way to wrap primitive fields
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;typically, add new field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isolate the accessor/updater to the primitive field to reduce the reference to the field that I want to wrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make set/get using both new and old field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch the set/get using the new field as primary field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the old field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove as many side-effect (command function) as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a strategy I followed?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flip conditional with as little effort as possible as demonstrate by Llewellyn Falco
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp6oSVDdbXQ&amp;#x26;ab_channel=CraftHubEvents&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp6oSVDdbXQ&amp;#x26;ab_channel=CraftHubEvents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid mutable state, creating new object instead of updating the state of the object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the steps I followed?

&lt;li&gt;Over the duration of this course, I’m sure we would discuss many patterns regarding mobbing. I hope those discussions could be documented somewhere so we can refer back to it and improve on it later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the moment, I see this topic as an iterative process to hash out some patterns that we would agree would be useful to our daily work and we would use it in our daily work and in our ensembles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hence, I was thinking of accepted/proposed, when it’s in proposed means it’s something we have discussed but we haven’t adopted to our daily working/ensembles yet. When it’s accepted, it means that we would do it in our ensembles and daily work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe it’s a wrong way to look at it, so maybe it makes more sense to have pain points section and the patterns section to address those pain points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Avoid criticizing others by following patterns such as:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people feel that they’re attacked or being criticized, the conversation becomes much harder and prevents people from contributing further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would rather do X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel uncomfortable doing X because Y&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When navigating and don’t know the direction, feel free to ask “I don’t know where to go next, Can someone help me?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s better to try it than debate/argues about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the driver doesn’t understand the instruction, feel free to say so and ask for more details
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intention, location, details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendly, Kindness, Consideration, and Respect atmosphere, which would create psychology safety to help the team improve&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reduce waste time and energy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e.: setting up the environment before joining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensemble Summary Pattern
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;summarize the intent of the previous navigator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red button to hit when someone has some tests to add&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X is &lt;strong&gt;future&lt;/strong&gt; Y, it’s a way to avoid using &lt;strong&gt;X is better than Y&lt;/strong&gt;. it’s a way to say &lt;strong&gt;I care, but I don’t mind y or x, I know y is an intermediate step for X anyway.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driver should use search more often compare to scrolling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobber should try to engage more with Driver/Navigator (.i.e: providing helpful information) as long as they do not try to control the driver/navigator

&lt;li&gt;tricks in helping describe ideas in code
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write pseudo-code in English or your own native language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe the intention what you try to accomplish with the loop, filter, map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the loop is complicated, try to describe how the key data structures inside the loop are evolved through each iteration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance between the discussion and the code
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the discussion is too long, mob ask the group to continue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at any moment, you’re stuck and don’t know what just happened? please speak up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you notice something to discuss/debates, write that down, and have that discussion at the end of the session, or wrote that down in the slack channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show up part-way through and you’re very welcome to announce your arrivals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notes from open space mob sessions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires people to have/get the skill in crucial conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impossible to rate individual performance when you mob fulltime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;law of contributing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do you have anything to contribute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can you learn from the session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people that dominates from the mob/ensemble could be rejected from the ensemble because of law of contributing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the task is known, take the mob to create a generator for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;introduce indirection steps to avoid big steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonytvo/introduce-indirection-layer&quot;&gt;Introduce an indirection layer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;read it, understand it, and put the information in the code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean up as we go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep track of which clean-up items to propose so that we can eventually do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it’s appropriate to isolate production code into their own file/module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe follow domain oriented guidelines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a note, we started it out with production code and test code are closed together because it would be easier for us to move in small steps. The production code is still changing quite a bit and we’re not sure what kind of abstraction/API we want to publish yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organize the source code so that the public API functions are closer to the top of the file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you aren’t sure how to do something, consider these things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do you already know how to do? maybe you can get there, but “the long way”. If you understand the long way better, you can turn this into a vocabulary problem: I don’t know enough shortcuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how far can you get before you’re stuck? once you’re stuck, you can ask a more specific question, which might lead to collecting a new “word”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can you get what you want another way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to practice solving the same problem in different ways and compare/contrast solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stub query/expect action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does the tests detect query or side effect, if it detect side-effects, we would like to make that side effects as direct as possible, like verifying calling the message on the interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When to do inside out (jump to details)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the risks in the details/certain tasks/components are large/noticeable and you want to mitigate the risks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wbitdd2-prerelease-discuss.jbrains.ca/t/noticing-signals-for-getting-stuck-when-test-driving/108/4?u=ttrung.vo&quot;&gt;https://wbitdd2-prerelease-discuss.jbrains.ca/t/noticing-signals-for-getting-stuck-when-test-driving/108/4?u=ttrung.vo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: “I need a thing to do X. I think library L can be made to do X. I’d better check that before I continue here.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the next steps are not clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When to do outside in (jump back to the big pictures)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you feel there’s a risk in missing some important details and it could delay the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you have difficulty in thinking about tests/what to test, it’s good to think in term of one level higher in the call stacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“when in doubt, zoom out”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patience in practicing evolutionary design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“programmers do not allow the various refactoring patterns to become so easy/comfortable that their fingers can execute them without conscious thought. This interferes with their progress because they have to switch more often among the questions “which refactorings will improve this design?” and “how do I perform this micro-step?” If they don’t become able to perform the micro-steps (a sequence of 3-7 nano steps) &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt;, then they might not breakthrough from “I know how to safely lead the design where I want it to go” to the more-powerful “I can just start removing duplication and improving names and a good design will emerge”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t get me wrong: the first of these two outcomes is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, but the second of these two outcomes is &lt;em&gt;much better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One consequence of never breaking through is that the programmer will miss out on finding helpful designs that are simpler than the ones that their intuition can see.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Independence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps to decide whether an object hides too much or hides the wrong information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has no built-in knowledge about the system in which it executes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should not use terms from multiple domains, unless it’s part of a bridging layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with the consumer of the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expressing the highest level of intention possible from the client/consumer perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another strategy is to use the pieces already there to build the next test. In the process, I often identify one small piece that is missing or identifies 2 pieces that don’t quite fit together yet. In either case, I see a smaller, clearer goal: write the missing piece or refactor so that A and B can connect together more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“if the implementation is wrong, how would a business person know?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that helps me to write the tests in higher-level language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not only “business person”. This is one of those questions to ask when you have trouble writing a test: “if the implementation were wrong, how would I know? what would I check?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build the things/abstraction we need in the test and move it to production code later
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“This is One way that the tests can drive the design, it reminds me of the chapter in the The Goal where the factory engineers a sale for the first time.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vocabulary problem
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because you don’t know enough “words” (options) to choose from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to build your vocabulary, you need to expose yourself to more “words”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;first, write a summary of the book to get a high-level overview of the topics of the book cover (I often copied from previous summaries to get things started and update the summaries as I go along)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then, elaborate/dig deeper into each topic wherever the curiosity takes you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the trick to retention is not to read it once but to write a good summary and review it often as much as you can.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is intelligence made visible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People think that design is styling. Design is not style. It’s not about giving shape to the shell and not giving a damn about the guts. Good design is a renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need, and beauty to produce something that the world didn’t know it was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is intelligence made visible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Design is] a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is design? it’s where you stand with a foot in 2 worlds - the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes - and you try to bring the 2 together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design isn’t just to satisfy requirements, but also to uncover requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perfection is not reached when there is nothing to be added anymore, but when there is nothing to be left out anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the design process, at its best, integrates the aspirations of art, science, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to say that something is designed means it has intentions that go beyond its function. Otherwise, it’s just planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good design defuses the tension between functional and aesthetic goals precisely because it works within the boundaries defined by the functional requirements of communication problem. Unlike the fine arts, which exists for their own sake, design must always solve a particular real-world problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in practice, designing seems to proceed by oscillating between sub-solution and sub-problem areas, as well as decomposing the problem and combining sub-solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you specify something to be designed, tell what properties you need, not how they are to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the trick is to hold “process” off long enough to permit great design to occur, so that the lesser issues can be debated once the great design is on the table - rather than smothering it in the cradle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good design is good business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you think it’s expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all… good design must primarily serve people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point: design is inevitable. The alternative to good design is bad design, not no design at all. Everyone makes design decisions all the time without realizing it - like Moliere’s M. Jourdain who discovered he had been speaking prose all his life, and good design is simply the result of making these decisions consciously, at the right stage, and in consultation with others as the need arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a good design is not the one that correctly predicts the future, it’s one that makes adapting to the future affordable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we’ve probably designed 4000 products at IDEO over my career, and for every one of them I’d like to send a little note with it that says, “I’m sorry that it’s in this present state. Given what I know now, if I could start over again it would be a lot better”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is easy. All you do is stare at the screen until drops of blood form on your forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ease of use and ease of learning are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;computer design is often bad design done on a computer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our opportunity as designers, is to learn how to handle the complexity, rather than shy away from it, and to realize that the big art of design is to make complicated things simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no, Watson, this was not done by accident, but by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is about making things good (and then better) and right (and fantastic) for the people who use and encounter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never design a building before I’ve seen the site and met the people who will be using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the only important thing about design is how it relates to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a design isn’t finished until somebody is using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The communication between the emotional and rational portions of your brain is the physical source of emotional intelligence.

&lt;li&gt;What you think, say, and do can increase your EQ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IQ: cognitive intelligence, your ability to learn; a set of ability that doesn’t change overtime (except in cases of traumatic injury)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EQ: emotional intelligence, your skills of being aware of your emotions and those of others along with managing your emotions and your relationships; a skill that you can learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personality: your temperament or style; a preference that is stable over a lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 statements/characteristics to define emotionally intelligent people
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They listen and learn from criticism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They maintain a positive (solution mode) attitude to difficult situations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They manage anxiety, fear, anger and all emotions appropriately in all situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They recognize how their behaviors affect others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are empathetic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have discipline and are self-motivated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They listen even if they disagree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They look for ways to improve when things don’t go according to plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EI is about figuring out how to apply, adapt, and deliver based on the needs of the person we’re with and what stage of the process they’re in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own it, Face it, Feel it, Ask it, Drive it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes, our subconscious mind causes us to try and validate our emotional responses consciously. For example, if you’re not feeling great, you might look for ways that the day is bad or getting worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the power of pause: pausing after someone’s answered a question or said something (for dramatic effect) to encourage them to draw upon their subconscious mind and bring deeper thoughts/feelings to the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify our own beliefs and values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Our minds are what created fear, and our mind is the only thing that can smash through it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself: ‘Do I want to change this? Why do I want to change this?’ What stands to happen if I don’t change this? What stands to happen if I don’t change this?’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accepting that something is going to happen and that the only thing we can control is how we choose to respond is where EI comes in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sympathy is feeling sorry for someone, whereas empathy is recognizing the emotional response someone is having and how it feels to have that emotional response
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting yourself in their shoes is dangerous because that typically comes with judgement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t need to know what has happened, just recognize what emotion and the severity of that emotion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize which emotion the person is feeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recall the last time you felt that emotion
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the best and worst thing someone could have said or done to you in that moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First thing we want is to be heard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help the other person gain control of their emotions and feel a connection&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I’m either good at something or I’m not -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I can improve my skills with effort and practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when people give me feedback, it feels like criticism -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I appreciate it; it helps me learn and grow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m just not good at math -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Math is challenging for me, but I know I can improve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m too shy to speak in front of the class -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;With practice, I can become more confident and improve my public speaking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m already a really good writer. I don’t need to get any better -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;There’s always room for improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;naturally smart people don’t need to try hard to succeed -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No one is born smart. We can all improve with time, effort and persistence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other people’s successes make me feel bad about myself -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Other people’s successes encourage and inspire me. They show me what is possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful people are lucky/talented and have never experienced failure -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Failure is part of success. Most successful people have failed many times, but they succeeded because they didn’t quit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I was as good at baseball as you. It’s not fair -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Your skills as a baseball player inspire me. Do you have any tips to help me improve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s embarrassing when I make a mistake -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;everyone makes mistakes, and mistakes are opportunities to learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I don’t try new or hard things, then I won’t fail -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I have to try new and difficult things in order to grow, even if I fail at first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I fail, I get frustrated and give up -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When I fail or get frustrated, I try again using the lessons I’ve learned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure means it is time to give up -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I only truly fail when I stop trying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t do that -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I can’t do that yet. I’m going to keep going, try new strategies, and/or ask for help until I understand it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I don’t improve right away, I get frustrated. I start to criticize myself -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I know improvement takes time, and I celebrate the small steps. Even a little progress makes a difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay attention when you feel an emotion begin to build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to understand the emotions and avoid labelling them good or bad.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay attention to how your emotions affect others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask others their view of how your emotions affect them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignoring feelings doesn’t make them go away. They will resurface. Face them when they come and try to work through them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay attention to how an emotion physically affects you (increased heart rate, dry mouth, tightening in stomach, neck, back; fast, shallow breathing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for practice, close your eyes and remember a high-emotion incident. Notice what physical symptoms you get simply thinking about it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to the situations or people that trigger your emotions. Think about why you might find those situations or people irksome.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about how your emotional reaction may make things worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to see things from the other’s perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formulate a calmer way to express your emotions and effectively convey your points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By keeping a journal of your emotions and what events triggered them, you can become more aware of patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’re stuck in a down mood, it’s not a good time to make important decisions. Briefly reflect on recent events that may have brought on the mood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your earliest memory of reacting like this? Are the people or circumstances similar in some way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;visit-your-values&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#visit-your-values&quot; aria-label=&quot;visit your values permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Visit Your Values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remind yourself of your values and how well you are currently living up to them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your core values and things that you have said or done recently that violate them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Notice your mood and how it influences your demeanour&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding your emotions in the expressions of artists allows you to learn about yourself and discover feelings that are often hard to communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, there is a big difference between how you see yourself and how others see you. When you ask for feedback, seek specific examples and look for similarities in what people tell you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People vary in how they react to stress. Which physical symptoms are common for you?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An upset stomach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pounding headache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canker sores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back spasms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you recognize that you are under stress, take some time to recharge your emotional battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shallow breaths deprive your brain of oxygen. This leads to poor concentration, forgetfulness, mood swings, anxiety and lack of energy. Breathe slowly and deeply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Emotion vs Reason List
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What Your Emotions are telling you to do” Vs “What Your Reason is Telling to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are your emotions clouding your judgement?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening requires focus, it’s far more than hearing the words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to the tone, speed, and volume of the voice and how those fluctuate. Are those sending the message beyond what the words say? You won’t know unless you focus fully on the person.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a public place to watch how people interact with one another. Notice body language.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When interacting with those of a different culture, observe their body language and manner of speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you aren’t sure what behavior would be acceptable, ask questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To confirm your interpretation of body language, use a reflective question. Example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It looks like you are feeling down about something. Did something happen?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself, “If I were this person, how would I [feel, react, respond]?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about how the person has reacted in similar situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeking feedback gives you a chance to see how others may view your behavior.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you intend as helpful responses and behaviors may appear unhelpful to other people. For example, others may interpret your attempt at courteous listening as lack of interest in the topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you enter a room, scan it for energy level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you describe the mood [enthusiastic, bored, somber, playful, cautious, angry]?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice how people arrange themselves, alone or in groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which people are animated and which are subdued?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Listen carefully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for examples of what you have said or done that led the person to view you in a certain way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether you agree with the feedback or not, thank the person for being willing to share their perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the feedback, think seriously about what you heard. How did you react to it emotionally and rationally?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a plan to make some adjustments so the person knows you took their feedback seriously.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than stifle or try to change people’s feelings, simply acknowledge them. You don’t have to agree with their feelings, but it helps to let them know you notice their struggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you sense that a person is upset of troubled, here is a process that may help:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It appears something is troubling you.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I’m sorry you are upset”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Do you want to talk about it?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If they do, then listen carefully”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarize what you heard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When someone does something well, don’t hesitate to let them know you notice it and appreciate it.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vary the way to do this. For example, try some of these:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In person thank you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email note&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greeting card&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at both sides to figure out where the interaction went off track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say something neutral to help you take a pause. It can be as simple as “This is hard”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use open communication to ask someone how to do/achieve something, if they still don’t do it keep emotion out of it, remaining calm and factual and tell them what they need to do. Set clear expectations, including consequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe ask the reason why they don’t want to do it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start your conversation by stating the common ground you share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask the person to share his or her point of view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resist the urge to plan a rebuttal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help the other person understand your side. Communicate clearly and directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if there is disagreement, once you understand both perspectives, find a way to move the conversation to closure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the meeting, keep in touch with the person to see how they are doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pausing between points&lt;/strong&gt; allows the audience to take in your idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow down&lt;/strong&gt; when explaining unfamiliar concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate to express&lt;/strong&gt; not impress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk with a &lt;strong&gt;strong confident voice&lt;/strong&gt; (be conscious of the 3 V’s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only &lt;strong&gt;share what your audience must not forget&lt;/strong&gt; in terms of level of detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the &lt;strong&gt;3 What’s&lt;/strong&gt; to keep conversations organized (see below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;stories, examples and analogies&lt;/strong&gt; to make your points more memorable and relatable for the audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing up when presenting&lt;/strong&gt; gives you a wider range of motion, you typically have more visual gestures (talking with your hand) and your audience can hear a difference in your voice (important even if you are in a voice only call)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen and ask open questions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not interrupt just listen, ask open ended question to keep them talking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will know they are done talking when they ask a question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledge and Pause
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn’t mean agreeing with the emotional response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledge what has happened and the circumstances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause is to ensure they have said everything they want/need to say&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we fix this?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Majority of people in this state already know what they want to happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List and confirm actions that will be taken, committing to time frame and ownership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following through with commitments is crucial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say “What else can I do to help?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the worst things that could possibly happen?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what’s the underlying core emotions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what’s my need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you either limit or mitigate the risk from occurring?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what would need to happen for this not to be a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what beliefs would you need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what training or skills? what emotions would you need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do you physically need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the easiest way to solve this?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the hardest way to solve this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the quickest way or the longest way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how would you feel if you solved this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do you want to feel like that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the first step to making this happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what could you do right now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you current responses make you feel? why is this a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you think you could leverage your mindset in different situations, to your advantage?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you think we can be more accommodating of each other’s dominant modalities in a collaborative setting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is our motivator/emotional driver?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are our values and beliefs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are our default emotional responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are our Style of Praise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are our style of feedback?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to Create a Connection?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you be empathetic if you have never felt the emotion someone is feeling before?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has anyone in your life stood out as being very empathetic? What did they do that made you feel this way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your EI profile?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What type of person are you? Work machine, analyst, innovator, tech guru, people lover?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behavior and relationships”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I could sum up emotional in 2 words, it would  be ‘own it’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;replace “why is this happening to me” with “what is this trying to teach me?”, everything shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“today I refuse to stress myself out about things I cannot control or change?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“be crazy, be stupid, be silly, be weird, be whatever, because life is too short to be anything but happy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our own minds is what created fear and our own mind is the only thing that can smash through it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Begin by asking yourself, “What emotion to I want to trigger in this situation?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself: ‘Do I want to change this? Why do I want to change this?’ What stands to happen if I don’t change this? What stands to happen if I don’t change this?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting that something is going to happen and that the only thing we can control is how we choose to respond is where EI comes in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock are to be held for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual investors are drawn into stocks during powerful bull markets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don’t appreciate the risks with stocks. And after they have suffered the inevitable loss, they sell.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No investor ever avoids loses at times, no matter how skilled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to estimate future stock returns is the DDM (Dividend Discount Method)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return = Dividend Yield + Dividend Growth Rate + Multiple Change
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend yield is the yield on the investment (Example – 2020 S+P 500 yield is 1.5%). The Dividend growth rate is historically 5%. And the Multiple change refers to the increase or decrease in the overall P/E ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dividend yield and dividend growth rate is the fundamental return (easy to estimate). The Multiple change is the speculative return (impossible to estimate).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benjamin Graham – “In the short run the stock market is a voting machine (speculative return), but in the long run, it is a weighing machine (fundamental return).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are ignorant of investment history are bound to repeat its mistakes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Bond durations of 6 months to 5 years are ideal for the risk dilution portion of the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something everyone knows isn’t worth knowing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the era’s conventional wisdom and then ignore it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year’s efficient frontier portfolio (high return at low risk or decent returns with no risk) will be nowhere near last years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one consistently times the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some managers spend lots of money researching macroeconomic, political, and market analysis to try to guess which assets will perform best in the future. And this is a fool’s errand.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why? The market has already priced this information into the current price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective portfolio diversification can increase return while reducing risks. Achieving this benefit requires rebalancing the portfolio back to its target or “policy” AA. This is difficult to do and almost always involves moving against the market sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long term success in individual security selection and market timing is difficult to impossible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future cannot be predicted, so therefore it is nearly impossible to specify in advance what the best asset allocation will be. Our job is to find an AA that will do reasonably well under a wide range of circumstances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking to your target AA through thick and thin is much more important than picking the right AA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An optimizer will heavily favor those assets with high historical or assumed returns. This is a problem because asset returns have a tendency to “mean revert”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can predict the inputs to the optimizer well enough, then you didn’t need an optimizer to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t use an optimizer to try to develop an asset allocation. We can’t predict returns, standard deviations, or correlations accurately enough. And if we could, we wouldn’t need one anyway.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And optimizing historic returns is a one-way ticket to the poor house&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-diversified portfolio is not a free lunch. It does not come anywhere near eliminating risk. You will still suffer loss from time to time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversification not only reduces risks, but also gives a “rebalancing bonus” or extra return from rigorous rebalancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefit is also psychological because you are getting into the habit of buying low and selling high. Thus, profiting by moving in the opposite direction of the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A distrust of “expert opinion” is one of the investors most useful tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also limits your exposure to only one market segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to forecast future optional portfolios by any technique&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual fund manager performance does not persist and the return on stock picking is zero&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These managers ARE the market, so there is no way they can ALL perform above the mean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Ellis (an avid tennis player) first saw the data demonstrating a lack of money manger skill. And He thought, I have seen this before in tennis matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most amateur tennis matches winning or losing was less a matter of skill and more of matter of playing conservatively and avoiding mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This applies to investors, those who simply buy and hold a diversified stock portfolio usually come out on top (Indexing).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success in both tennis and investing is less a matter of winning and more a matter of avoiding losing.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The easiest way to lose is to trade excessively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate loss avoidance strategy is to simply buy and hold the entire market or to index
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This reduces all the expenses associated with active management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunn’s Law – When an asset class does relatively well, an index fund in that class does even better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only money made from newsletters is from the subscriptions, not from taking the advice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money mangers do not exhibit consistent stock picking skill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody can time the market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the above 2 points, it is futile to select money mangers on the basis of past performance
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the above 3 points, the most rational way to invest in stocks is to use low cost passively managed index funds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Nobel winners have tried and failed (Long-Term Capital Management), what chance do I have? And during a bear market, stocks usually decline much faster than they advance during a bull market. But you don’t want to get out of the market then because you will miss the rally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long term returns are usually higher when valuations are cheap and lower when they are expensive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Miller did the first study on cheap stocks called the Dow P/E strategy. He examined buying the 10 lowest P/E stocks in the Dow from 1936-1964 and discovered that the lowest P/E stocks (those everyone hates) actually outperformed the market and the highest P/E stocks (those everyone loves) greatly underperformed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreman has observed that “value” stocks tend to fall less in price than “growth” stocks when earnings disappoint. Conversely, “value” stocks tend to rise more in price than “growth” stocks when earnings exceed expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To put it another way, good companies are generally bad stocks, and bad companies are generally good stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has puzzled academics EMH theorists why these value type strategies have worked so well for so long even after they were discovered. (The market should have arbitrated this away long ago). The reason the strategies still work is that cheap companies are dogs, and most people cannot bring themselves to buy them. This concept is very difficult for investors and money managers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best explanation for value stocks can be found in Robert Haugen The New Finance: The Case Against Efficient Markets. In 1993 the highest 20% P/E stocks (Growth) had an average P/E of 42. Earnings yield was 2.36% or 1/42. The lowest 20% P/E stocks (Value) had a P/E of 12. Earnings yield was 8.38% or 1/12. So, if you bought growth stocks in 1993, you received $2.36 for every $100 invested. If you bought value stocks then, you received $8.38 in earnings for every $100 invested. That means growth stocks earnings have to grow 3x larger than value stocks just to break even. The growth stocks did have higher earnings than value, but not enough to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the behavioral (people don’t like buying bad companies) and increased risk (companies are not in great financial shape) explain value companies higher returns than growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value companies tend to do better than growth during bear markets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividend Discount Method (DDM) formulated by John Burr Williams in 1938 was formulated by a simple idea. Since all companies eventually go bankrupt, the value of a stock, bond or the entire market is simply the value of all its future dividends discounted to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, its value must be reduced or discounted to reflect the fact you won’t receive it today.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reduction is called the Discount Rate (DR)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DR is determined by the cost of money (Risk Free Rate) plus the risk to the lender
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safer investments have a lower DR and risker investments a higher DR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DR can also be thought of as the expected return of the asset
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower risks = lower DR = Lower expected return/Higher Present Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher risks = higher DR = Higher expected return/Lower Present Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formula – Reasonable Price = (Annual Dividend Amount)/(DR – Dividend Growth Rate)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But you can make this formula say anything you want depending on your inputs. So be careful with this formula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic asset allocation refers to the possibility of varying your policy allocation because of changing market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only people who have mastered fixed asset allocation and the required rebalancing should consider dynamic asset allocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He used to recommend changing your equity/bond AA based on conditions but that doesn’t work anymore. Now he only recommends changing equity allocations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When stocks get more expensive, their future returns are likely to be lower and when stocks are very cheap, future returns are likely to be higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on this, it is not a terrible idea to change your AA slightly in the opposite direction based on valuations, but not by much.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target AA, you purchase more of an asset that has declined in price, and thus cheaper.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you actually increase the target portfolio weighting of an asset when its price declines and gets cheaper, you are simply rebalancing in a more vigorous form – you are “overbalancing”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not change your AA based on changes in economic, political conditions or analyst recommendations, that is a poor idea
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the authors opinion, overbalancing is likely to increase return if done correctly. But few investors have the nerve and discipline to rebalance and “overbalancing” requires even more of that nerve and discipline so few should try it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings experience risk in the short term. This is because in nature, our ancestors had to focus on short term risks to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, this is of less value in a modern society, specifically in the world of investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanguard and DFA are great choices for funds. Vanguard is owned by the shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) vs Lump Sum investing – from a purely financial point of view, it is usually better to put your money to work right away. However, if you are not used to owning risk assets, then it might be best to go slow and DCA your way into the market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DCA – Involves investing the same amount regularly in a given fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not underestimate the discipline that is sometimes necessary to carry out a successful DCA program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value Averaging (VA) – Is another technique for investing in the market (read the book for more information on how to do it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become familiar with the long-term history of the behavior of different classes of stocks and bonds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolios behave differently than their constituent parts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A safe portfolio does not necessarily exclude very risky assets. Even the investor who seeks the safest possible portfolio will own some risky assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investor’s objective then is not to find the efficient frontier, rather the goal is to find a portfolio mix that will come reasonably close to the mark under a broad range of circumstances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the behavior of your whole portfolio, not its parts. Some will be doing very well or very bad at times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets are smarter than you are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not run with the crowd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on market valuations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in your policy AA should be made only in response to valuations changes, and in a direction opposite the market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good companies are usually bad stocks; bad companies are usually good stocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Favor a “value” approach to investing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to change your asset allocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Reasons to change your AA
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial goal is well within reach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You realize you will not need all your money during your lifetime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You risk tolerance isn’t what you thought it was&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any AA changes should require deep thinking and even-handed judgement. Don’t make changes during times of duress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allocate our investments across multiple asset classes to reduce overall portfolio risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invest broadly within each class to eliminate the risk of owning any single security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your costs down including taxes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalance periodically&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AA The Three-Step Approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many different asset classes do I want to own?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How “conventional” of a portfolio do I want?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much risk can I and do I want to take?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much complexity can you tolerate and tracking error?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The law of diminishing returns applies to asset classes. You get a diversification boost from the first several, after that, you are just amusing yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more complex your AA, the more tracking error you will get vs the index (Like the S+P 500). You have to ask yourself how much will that bother you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracking error means that your portfolio will behave very differently than everyone else’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If that bothers you, then you need a simpler portfolio. If it doesn’t, then you can be more complex.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing the number of asset classes will improve diversification but will also increase your work and tracking error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your precise AA will depend on three factors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerance to tracking error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of assets you wish to own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerance for risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases returns while decreasing risks. Most important concept in portfolio theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two assets with positive returns should not have persistent highly negative correlations.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixing assets with uncorrelated returns reduces risk. You can find these.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the long run though, meaningful negative (inverse) correlations are never seen. That would be too good to be true if they did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimal Asset Allocation of the last 20 years is unlikely to look anything like the one for the next 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The optimal AA can only be known in retrospect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking by your AA policy through thick and thin I much more important than picking a “best” AA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good idea is to decide on a static percentage of stocks, bonds, alternative investments that fit your needs and then maintain that allocation for a long, long, long time. Then rebalance as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a nation, we are not saving enough in retirement accounts to make up for diminishing Social Security benefits and other traditional sources of income&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10% savings of pre-tax income is a good target for most people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a fondness for seeing patterns where they don’t exist. Stocks that have done well in the past are expected to continue to do well and stocks that have done poorly are expected to continue to do poorly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid the temptation to follow the herd and invest in the hottest sectors or stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t chase popular investment styles. Stick with your plan and give it time to work out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to predict which type of fund will outperform any given year. Therefore, the best strategy is to hold a diversified portfolio that contains all types and stick with it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more a mutual fund charges in fees, the lower the expected return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take caution where you get financial advice, most of it is just salesmanship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools have spent lots of money and hours trying to figure out which active managed mutual fund managers are likely to outperform in the future. They discovered 2 facts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funds with low fees tend to outperform the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unreliable to assume that managers who have beaten the market in the past will continue to do so over the long term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On any given year, the index fund will be beat by many active managed funds. But in the long run, the index fund will be at the top&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce your estimated Social Security check at retirement by 60-70% and an increase of 5-7 years for retirement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treat Social Security and defined pension plans as a separate account and don’t use it in your equity/bond calculations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the short term, it is nearly impossible to predict the movement of the stock market. But over the long term, the performance of the stock market is predictable because it follows the growth of the U.S. economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Growth (Corporate Earnings or GDP) +Dividend (Yield)+Speculation (P/E ratio) = market return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short run, speculation creates the volatility in stock prices, but in the long term, economic growth is the real driver of returns. You can’t guess what P/E ratio the market will assign in the future so don’t try&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to forecast the movement of the inflation rate, but you can limit risk by purchasing short term bonds. They don’t have the volatility of long-term bonds. You do get extra yield from long term bonds but it does not justify the added interest rate risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your investments have a low correlation with each other or you don’t get the benefits of diversification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a long-term strategic asset allocation or “buy and hold”. No predictions needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful lifelong investment experience hinges on 3 critical steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of a prudent financial plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full implementation of that plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The discipline to maintain that plan in good AND bad times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6-12-month Emergency Fund recommended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in the next hot item is very difficult to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking a manager who can pick the next hot item is equally difficult to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not select mutual funds on past performance. Past performance is not an indication of future results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Bills are “risk free” but can still lose money due to taxes and inflation. If their - purchasing power doesn’t keep up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High volatility means erratic returns. Low volatility means more consistent returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot eliminate all risk from a portfolio but you can reduce it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will lose money during some times. Don’t try to market time your way out of it. You can’t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do NOT abandon your plan because you lose money. In the last 50 years the market is up 4 years for every 1 down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning several asset classes is better than owning a few&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose asset classes that have positive real returns and lower correlation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can select a good asset allocation but not a perfect one. Don’t overanalyze&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not possible to know which asset classes will perform well at any given time, therefore it is important to retain ALL asset classes in your portfolio at all times and to rebalance these annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign stocks are great for US investors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do not always move in correlation with the US market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They trade in foreign currency which is another diversifier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no known way to design a portfolio that is fully hedged against downturns while fully participating in the upswings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for mutual funds that have low expense ratios and no redemption fees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prefer index mutual funds and ETF’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay away from high cost illiquid investments unless you really know what you are doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to stay invested during all market conditions to benefit from the gains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run of investing, you are compensated for taking risks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, if you seek safety, your returns will be low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced investors understand risk and reward are intertwined&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the easiest ways to spot investment fraud is the promise of excessive returns with low risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no risk-free investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practitioners view risk as investment volatility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals view risk as losing money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investments with less risk of income disruptions have lower expected returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio risk cannot be eliminated but it can be controlled with an asset allocation strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not expect high returns without high risk. Do not expect safety without correspondingly low returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer a risky asset is held, the less chance of a poor result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sign of a dangerously overbought market is a generalized underappreciation of the risks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonsystematic Risk – Risk that disappears with diversification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systematic Risk – Risk that cannot be diversified away&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real assets are almost always imperfectly correlated (Mostly positive) in real life (An above average return in one is somewhat more likely to be associated with an above-average return in the other)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is difficult to find 2 assets that are uncorrelated and it is practically impossible to find 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncorrelated is 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inverse is -1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfect is +1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation is measured on a -1 to +1 scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+0.3 or greater is positive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-0.3 or less is negative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-0.3 to 0.3 is noncorrelated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 2 investments move in the same direction at the same time, they have positive correlation. If they move in opposite directions, they have negative correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want investments that have lower correlation to each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t purchase new investments that have a high positive correlation with investments you already have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative correlation is theoretically ideal when selecting investments but this doesn’t occur in the real world. Typically, the best asset pairs you will find are noncorrelated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlations are dynamic, not static. And you can’t guess when/how they will change. For example – The S+P 500 and Intermediate term treasury bonds have been between +0.49 to -0.42 correlated in the last 20 years (1990-2009). Average was 0 so they are noncorrelated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation is not the only reason to invest. The security must also have a positive expected rate of return. It is basically impossible to find 2 negative correlated asset classes that both earn a positive rate of return. Noncorrelated is your best bet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During extreme volatility when you want low correlation among asset classes, positive correlation increases drastically across all classes. Especially during bear markets or disasters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a given degree of risk, there is a portfolio that will deliver the most return. But this can only be known in retrospect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect portfolio can only be known in retrospect. So, don’t overanalyze&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in real life risks, returns, and correlations of various assets fluctuate considerably over time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two types of investors, those who don’t know where the market is headed, and those who don’t know that they don’t know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For all practical purposes there is no such thing as stock picking skill
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those early high returns attract large number of investors who wind up with average returns (if they are lucky)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;rebalancing&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#rebalancing&quot; aria-label=&quot;rebalancing permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;rebalancing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing is the most difficult because it forces you to sell what is going up and to buy what went down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to rebalance through changes in what you buy, try not to rebalance by selling assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing increases long term portfolio performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It instills the investor with the discipline to buy low and sell high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If two assets have similar long term returns and risks are not perfectly correlated, then investing in a fixed rebalanced mix of the two not only reduces risks, but also actually increases return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The excess return though is not obtained without rebalancing. It forces you to buy low and sell high to rebalance your asset allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing is based on a theory called regression to the mean. That is, there is a natural tendency in the marketplace for all broad asset classes to return close to their history risk profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you rebalance, you sell some of the winners to buy some of the losers. It may feel counterintuitive at first but it follows the logic to buy low and sell high&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calendar based rebalancing is a good idea. Pick a date and rebalance then. You are more likely to not procrastinate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing only works if the investments in the portfolio don’t act the same way. You want assets that don’t correlate with each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing in your tax advantaged accounts every year or two should be ok&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try not to rebalance in your taxable accounts or do it as little as possible. Try to rebalance though buying because rebalancing triggers taxable events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalance your portfolio at least 1 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not rebalance too frequently. Let momentum work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means to rebalance at most once per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investment in a total US stock market fund is a solid foundation on which to base a US stock market allocation. Total Index are heavily weighted toward large cap stocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your age x 1.5 for your % AA to a TDF. Example. 40 x 1.5 = 60% allocation to TDF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midcap indexes are highly correlated with total stock market indexes and are therefore a poor diversifier. You don’t need them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25% max dedicated toward factor tilts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to tilt, above all, be patient and stick to your guns. Don’t chase returns. Once you decide to tilt, you need to stick with that strategy and not bailout of it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enemy of a good asset allocation is the quest for a perfect one. Fight the urge to be perfect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study in 1992 By Fama and French – Performance of a broadly diversified US stock portfolio relied on 3 primary risks axis to determine its return. 95% accuracy as to what the portfolio would return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market risk or Beta – all portfolios move up or down in relation to the total stock market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percent of small cap in the portfolio by weight – small stocks have higher returns and do not always have correlation to the total stock market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percent of value orientation – value stocks have a higher return than growth and do not correlate with growth stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small cap value index has outperformed growth with less standard deviation from 1979-2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a 50/50 value/growth index during this time added no return and increased standard deviation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small cap stocks have higher expected returns but also higher standard deviation than large cap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This occurs in foreign markets too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small Cap value along with total stock market is a good choice in your portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Layers of Mutual Fund Costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expense Ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bid-Ask Spreads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market-Impact Costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advantages – Can be traded throughout the day, do not generate capital gains taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disadvantages – Incur commissions and spreads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks outperform almost all other assets in the long run because you are buying a piece of our almost constantly growing economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But then investors make the mistake of thinking the most profitable stocks to own must be those of the most rapidly growing companies (Growth Stocks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;international&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#international&quot; aria-label=&quot;international permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;International&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International equity provides currency diversification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global equity invests in both US and international. Not usually a good idea unless you have a very small amount of money want diversification from 1 fund&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good idea to have both US AND International equities in your portfolio at all times. You don’t know which one will win. US won from 1970-2001 then International has won since&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada’s economy is weighted heavily toward finance, energy and basic materials. Canada has lots of natural resources and investing in them acts as a hedge against commodity prices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A permanent allocation to emerging market stocks is recommended. Emerging markets are very volatile. Recently Emerging markets have increased their correlation to US markets but this may or may not continue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the allocation to international stocks is about 30% of the equity portion of your portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent studies prove the size and value premium (F+F study above) works in international stocks like it does with US. This means international small cap is a good idea too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign stocks are subject to currency, political, trading, custody and regulatory risk. You must understand these risks. But they do provide diversification to a portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign stocks belong in everyone portfolio. The primary benefit is to reduce standard deviation or risks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;fixed-income&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fixed-income&quot; aria-label=&quot;fixed income permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fixed Income&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diversified fixed income portfolio enhances return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-cost bond mutual funds are an ideal way to invest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax considerations may be an important element in fixed income when investing in a taxable account&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond Structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short – 3 years or less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intermediate – 4 to 9 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long – 10+ years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer term bonds have higher interest rate risk. Longer maturity = higher rates. Opposite true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower quality bonds have higher credit risk. Lower credit rating = higher rates. Opposite true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High yield bonds have not only credit risks but the real danger that the issuers will default&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipal bonds are a good choice for people in higher tax brackets in taxable accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate is a separate asset class from stocks and bonds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REIT are a convenient way to invest in real estate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REITs have low correlation with stocks and bonds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all commercial lease contracts have a built-in inflation hedge. Therefore, REITs are a good inflation hedge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REITs are the simplest way to participate in the real estate market. They are also liquid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index Equity REITs and ETFs are a good choice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REITs are divided into 3 categories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity – Real estate properties. Most pure holding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mortgage REITs – do not own property, they finance property. Bond investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid – Hold both&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10% allocation to REIT is enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not include home equity in your asset allocation models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity REITs are portfolios of apartments, hotels, malls, industrial buildings, and other rental property&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REIT’s and Precious Metals stocks can have a place in a portfolio even if they have lower expected returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are inflation hedges and likely to do well in an inflationary environment in which other stocks and bonds would be adversely affected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;behavioral&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#behavioral&quot; aria-label=&quot;behavioral permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Behavioral&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistic expectations are important to investment planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market volatility is more predictable than market return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments with expected positive investment return and higher volatility have higher expected return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All investments have risk. Even T-Bills which is inflation risk. There is no risk-free investment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than 12 funds because it gets too complex with higher fees and diminishing returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not change your percentage of equity/bond based on what you think the market will do. Once you select a ratio stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people can’t stomach a 100% equity portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-developed plan works only when the investor sticks to the plan through good and bad times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sensible investment plan never fails an investor, the investor fails the plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to more optimistic about stocks after the market goes up and less after it goes down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors give too much weight to recent information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to buy investments that have had a recent run-up in performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors label investments good or bad depending of the price relative to where they bought it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are reluctant to admit errors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overconfident investors generally believe they have more knowledge and information than they actually do. Therefore, they tend to trade too much and underperform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Males tend to be overconfident&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Females tend to do better at sticking to a long-term plan and usually perform better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not change your investment strategy during a bear market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can rebalance without hesitation even during bad markets, your risk tolerance is good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors tend to suffer from overconfidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many portfolio failures occur when investors take on too much risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recency bias – biggest mistake most experienced investors make&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to extrapolate recent trends indefinitely into the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try as hard as you can to identify the current financial wisdom so that you can ignore it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2000, when the book was published, US was doing better than foreign stocks. What were the experts saying at that time?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay at home for higher returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy only companies you know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversify abroad at your own peril&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do diversify abroad, only do where you can drink the water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of recency and do not be overly impressed with the asset class returns over periods of less than 2-3 decades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unhappy with the degree of risk in the portfolio, you have 2 ways to reduce it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employ less risky individual assets (Not a good idea) – like adding large cap for small cap stocks, domestic for foreign stocks, utility for industrial stocks. It changes the dynamics of the portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stick with your basic asset allocation and replace some of your entire stock AA with short term bonds. (Good idea)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk Dilution – if you believe that you have arrived at an effective stock allocation, it is generally a better idea to employ risk dilution as this leaves the stock AA undisturbed
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A conservative risk adverse strategy will almost always involve at least a small amount of exposure to very risky individual assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average investor suffers from overconfidence and thinks that they can beat the market, but this is a mathematical impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average investor must by definition obtain the market return minus expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors suffer from recency bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When prices fall, investors estimate of future returns goes lower too. This is irrational.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors tend to overweight more recent data and underweight older data
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most investors are “convex” traders in which they buy equities as they are rising and sell as they are falling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opposite is a “concave” investor who buys as prices fall and sells as they rise
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a world dominated by convex traders, it is an advantage to be a concave trader, and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg-led5YMlo&amp;#x26;ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg-led5YMlo&amp;#x26;ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some financial manipulations, or shenanigans, are benign and may not hurt anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shenanigans that inflate profits are of greatest concern, followed by those that hide expenses or shift revenue from one time period to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all financial shenanigans are illegal, nor do they necessarily violate generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarterly financial reports are not independently audited, however it is highly unlikely a company will be caught manipulating unaudited reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only a small fraction of companies fraudulently distort their financial reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapidly growing firms that suddenly face a slow down may be tempted to cheat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporting bogus revenue can destroy a company’s reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CEO fixated on making “the numbers” at any cost is an investor’s nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal auditors should report directly to the Board of Directors’ audit committee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SEC should have authority to bar or suspend corporate executives and board members who become involved in fraudulent financial reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;when to be on the look out&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a company operates in a weak oversight environment, with a closely held board of directors or without a competent independent auditor, you have reason for concern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If management faces an inordinate degree of competitive pressure, that should draw your attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If executives are known, for whatever reason, to be of dubious character or integrity, you have reason to wonder if that lack of integrity has crept over into other areas of the company’s business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If any of these indicators takes place in a previously high-flying company where growth is now starting to slow, be especially wary and on the lookout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also be cautious about inner doings at basket-case companies that are struggling just to stay alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;audit your auditor&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The auditors spend weeks reviewing the financial records of a company, so spend some time reading their opinions. The opinion letter will usually give a clean view, that is, it will give the report a stamp of approval. If the auditors have a serious reservation about the accuracy and fairness of a company’s financial statement, however, they will usually qualify the report. A company that receives a qualified opinion should raise the hackles on an investor’s back - especially if the qualification notes any “going concern.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also look out for a situation where no audit committee exists, or the audit committee is comprised of less-than-independent members. The purpose of the audit committee is to act as a go-between, mediating between the outside auditor and the executives. Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange are required to have audit committees. No similar requirement binds most other publicly traded companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;catching the crooks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So how do you find out when a company is scamming you? Screening the veracity of financial reports is easier now, thanks to several Internet databases that equip you to check for signs of malfeasance. Some sites focus more on the numbers, others help you investigate a company’s footnotes, management discussions and news releases. The most widely used commercial database is Compustat, which is a product that is sold by Standard &amp;#x26; Poor’s, a division of McGraw-Hill. Another database is sold by Factset Corporation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With these tools, you can run a filter for companies showing the sharpest decline in operational cash flow, as a percentage of net income. Or you can list companies that experienced the largest year-to-year sales growth followed by declining or negative growth. You can also seek the biggest increase in inventory, compared to sales. Other things you can look for include a very large deterioration in gross margins, a big jump in soft assets or a large increase in deferred revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;buying trouble&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquisitions are fertile ground for chicanery. Many companies seek to buy other companies in order to rapidly accelerate their own growth, a strategy with many risks for investors. Several tricks that relate to acquisitions can be used to help cover up the underlying ill health of the purchasing company. These gimmicks include taking large write-offs before or after the acquisition, shifting loses from the deal to another time period and releasing the reserves that may be created through large write-offs. Be concerned when a firm uses very aggressive acquisition behavior in a way that might make its sales look better than they really are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the lessons of enron&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the lessons of Enron is to be wary when a company makes a drastic change in how it does business. This is especially the case when a company is making a transition from an easily understood model, such as acquiring gas pipelines, to a model that is far more difficult to assess, such as trading on future energy contracts. Other warning signs included the use of special-purpose entities (SPEs), that is, off the books facilities that could be used to hide either profits or liabilities. Red flags should have been flapping because Enron did not provide detailed disclosure about the purpose of the SPEs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounting’s two fraudulent strategies are to either inflate or deflate earnings.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first can be accomplished by reporting an unduly large current period revenue, or by underestimating current period expenses. Manipulating either side of the ledger will work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second, less intuitive strategy involves deflating or underestimating earnings. Why would anyone want to do that? Well, if you underestimate your financial performance, you can shift earnings to a later timeframe when you need them to cover shortfalls. Essentially you minimize current profits in order to inflate future profits, thereby making the company appear to perform better than it actually does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies manipulate financial statements for three reasons:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is easy&lt;/strong&gt; – After all, managers themselves check a variety of options to select the accounting methods their firms will use. Managers with integrity review the options available to find a reporting method that most closely reflects the company’s performance. Unscrupulous executives, however, see the choices as an opportunity to take advantage of the system. Management is free to structure transactions or to announce reporting moves to promote the achievement of its accounting goals. For example, when using an operating lease approach, they can use lease agreements to keep debt off the books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can pay off handsomely&lt;/strong&gt; – Bonuses are often tied to a company’s financial profiles, so managers have a vested interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The chances of getting caught are slim&lt;/strong&gt; – Those who think they’ll get away with it are often right. For instance, a company’s quarterly financial statements are unaudited and, usually, are not reviewed by an independent CPA. When an unaudited financial report is manipulated, it is highly unlikely that the company will be caught.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you evaluate the validity of a company’s reporting, be aware of any misguided management incentives. These are not at all uncommon. Basing bonuses and stock options heavily on financial statement measurements create a temptation to cheat. Too much emphasis on the bottom line can cause observers to question the validity of a firm’s numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA) has defined 30 techniques, grouped into seven categories, that represent the ways that unethical companies dupe investors
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording bogus revenue&lt;/strong&gt; – This is the cardinal sin of accounting, and it can be accomplished in more ways than you might think. For example, some sales may appear to be significant, but they lack actual economic substance. Cash received in lending transactions can be recorded cleverly as revenue. Similarly, a company may try to record investment income as operating revenue. Another nasty trick is to count as revenue the rebates from suppliers that the company will receive on future purchases. And, finally, a company may release revenue that it improperly held back in the first place, perhaps prior to a merger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording poor-quality revenue&lt;/strong&gt; – All revenue is not equal. Revenue for services that have not yet been provided, for example, is poor revenue and shouldn’t be counted. Revenue should never be recorded before the item being sold has actually shipped and been accepted by the customer. A company should not record revenue if the customer isn’t required to pay. Sales to an affiliated company are also dubious. Grossing up revenue is another way to “cook the books.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-time gains&lt;/strong&gt; – Occasionally a company will sell assets or make an investment windfall, and count that as revenue. The problem is that this is really only a one-time gain. Similarly, a one-time gain can be used to make operating expenses appear less than they really are. Another dirty little trick is reclassifying accounts on the balance sheet in a way that creates apparent income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failing to report future liabilities accurately&lt;/strong&gt; – One way a company can put lipstick on the pig is to fail to record an obligation, or otherwise move to reduce the list of liabilities improperly. Of course, owing less money makes a company look more profitable. This can be achieved by changing accounting assumptions, allowing reserves to be suddenly counted as income or creating phony rebates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expense-shifting&lt;/strong&gt; – If you can stretch current expenses out so that they actually fall into a later reporting period, the results will appear to be better than they actually are. This includes reducing reserves, failing to write off impaired assets or taking too long to amortize expenses. Or, you could simply change accounting policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Income-shifting&lt;/strong&gt; – Manipulation can also occur by way of shifting current revenue to a later period. This is sometimes achieved by creating a reserve account, and then eliminating it later on when the money is needed. Also be aware that companies occasionally hold back income before an acquisition deal closes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special charges&lt;/strong&gt; – Even more subtle is the business of shifting future costs to the current period, as a special charge. Inflating the amount of a special charge, writing off R &amp;#x26; D costs related to an acquisition and accelerating discretionary expenses are a few of the tricks of the trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fighting-shenanigans&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fighting-shenanigans&quot; aria-label=&quot;fighting shenanigans permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fighting shenanigans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can be done to make sure there is no recurrence of Enron? Many parties must be involved in changing the way things work. Those who determine and interpret laws, and set professionals standards must establish clear parameters on proper financial accounting and reporting standards. Internal auditors should report directly to the audit committees of their boards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission, set up after the stock market crash of 1929 to supervise the nature and accuracy of information provided to investors, should be given explicit legal authority to suspend or bar any corporate executive, director or board involved in financial misdealings. Management must set the proper tone and cannot emphasize reaching its numbers above everything else. Companies should be required to have auditors review their quarterly financial statements before they are released to the public. Auditors should be held more accountable for detecting fraud during an audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the SEC, the NASD and the NYSE combined forces to commission a study recommending ways to strengthen the audit committee function. The blue-ribbon panel determined that boards of directors have to engage in active, independent oversight. The notion that a seat on a board is a reward for having “made it” in business should be replaced by an active responsibility to guide the company forward. The audit committee has to be the main body that is responsible for driving the acceptance of proper accounting practices within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps financial shenanigans can never be completely eliminated. But certain steps can and must be taken to restore corporate credibility. Auditor training should place greater emphasis on the ability to detect accounting tricks and manipulations. Training should also be improved for those who rely on financial reports, including investors. The incentives to manipulate the numbers that are built into executive compensation packages should be re-evaluated. Investors, auditors and regulators have a much better chance of minimizing the damage that corporate dishonesty causes once they gain a better understanding of how dishonest companies pull off financial shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quotes&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quotes&quot; aria-label=&quot;quotes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;price is what you pay, value is what you get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accounting is the language of business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Financial shenanigans are actions that intentionally distort a company’s reported financial performance and financial condition. They range from benign (changes in accounting estimates) to egregious (fraudulent recognition of bogus revenue).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In general, shenanigans that inflate revenue should be considered more serious than those that affect expenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A compensation structure that heavily emphasizes the bottom line creates an environment that sometimes encourages accounting chicanery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…management may have little difficulty distorting financial reports if the company has weak internal controls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When companies face troubled times because of business slowdowns and other setbacks, their managers frequently take certain (bookkeeping) steps to ensure that the sun will come out tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Special charges offer a wonderful opportunity to artificially boost future operating profits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite the efforts of rule makers, internal and independent auditors, regulators and others working in harmony to prevent, detect and eliminate financial shenanigans, the problem continues to exist and is not likely to disappear any time soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors should be wary whenever a company dramatically changes its business model, particularly from one easily understood by investors to another, far more obtuse and difficult to evaluate and monitor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concrete, repeatable techniques that can be employed to improve applications
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strive for simplicity, focus on smells, concentrate on difference, take small steps, follow the flocking rules, refactoring under green, fix easy problem first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;following the horizontal path means writing code to produce every kind of verse before diverging onto tangents to DRY out small bits of code that the verses have in common. The goal is to quickly maximize the number of whole examples before extracting abstractions from their parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in addition, deal with new requirements by first refactoring existing code to be open to them and then writing new code to meet them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you should not reach for abstractions, but instead you should resist them until they absolutely insist upon being created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing code is the process of working your way to the next stable end point, not the end point itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your goal is to write straightforward code, these metrics (ABC metrics) point you toward &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Shameless Green&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;getting insight into potential expense of code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how difficult was it to write?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how hard is it to understand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how expensive will it be to change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;terminology: method vs sending messages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “method” is defined on an object and contains behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “message” is sent to an object to invoke behavior
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;song() { verses(); }&lt;/code&gt; means that song method sends the verses message to the receiver this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore, &lt;strong&gt;method are defined, and messages are sent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“sending messages” are preferred to “call a method/function” as it implicitly encourage to create message senders that are willfully ignorant of implementation details, and fosters independence between senders and receivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;code is easy to understand when it clearly reflects the problem it’s solving, and thus openly exposes that problem’s domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speculatively general and concretely abstract were both written with an eye toward reducing future costs, and it is distressing to see good intentions fail so spectacularly. &lt;strong&gt;The failure here is not bad intention - it’s insufficient patience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s far more code here  than is needed to pass the tests. This unnecessary code took time to write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the many levels of indirection are confusing. You could study this code for a long time without discerning why they are needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you may feel compelled to understand its purpose before making changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the rule to determine which verse should be sung next? buried deep within the NoMore lambda is a hard-coded “99,” which might cause one to infer that verse 99 follows verse 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“DRY makes sense when it reduces the cost of change more than it increases the cost of understanding the code”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DRYing out code is not free. It adds a level of indirection, and layers of indirection make the details of what’s happening harder to understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marina-ferreira/99_bottles_of_oop/blob/main/chapter_1/03_concretely_abstract.rb&quot;&gt;concretely abstract code&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it clearly took a fair amount of thought and time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the individual methods are easy to understand, it’s tough to get a sense of the entire song. The parts doesn’t seem to add up to the whole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;while changing the code inside any individual method is cheap, in many cases, one simple change will cascade and force many other changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the rule to determine which verse should be sung next? Ditto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shameless green is defined as the solution that quickly reaches green while prioritizing understandability over changeability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it doesn’t dispute that DRY is good, rather, it believes that it is cheaper to manage temporary duplication than recover from incorrect abstractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marina-ferreira/99_bottles_of_oop/blob/main/chapter_1/04_shameless_green.rb&quot;&gt;shameless green&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was easy to write and understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will be cheap to change. Even though the verse strings are duplicated, if one verse changes it’s easy to keep the others in sync.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the rule to determine which verse should be sung next? This is still not explicit. The 0 verse contains a deeply buried, hard-coded 99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for context/concrete guidance of what the code trying to accomplish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;any pile of code can be made to work; good code not only works, but it also simple, understandable, expressive and changeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can think of metrics as crowd-sourced opinions about the quality of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;measuring programmer productivity by counting lines of code (SLOC))
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easily garnered and reproduced, it reflects code volume but suffers from many flaws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclomatic complexity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an algorithm that counts the number of unique execution paths through a body of source code. The more deeply nested conditionals, the higher Cyclomatic complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code with fewer nested conditionals (lower cyclomatic complexity) is easier to reason with and maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can be used to limit the overall complexity. You can set standards for how high a score you’re willing to accept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can use it to determine if you’ave written enough tests, as it tells you the minimum number of tests needed to cover all the logic in the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assignments, branches and conditions (ABC) metrics
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assignments is a count of variable assignments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;branches counts not branches of an if statement but branches of control, meaning function calls or message sends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conditions counts conditional logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABC scores reflect cognitive load as opposed to physical size. High ABC numbers indicate code that takes up a lot of mental space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t do&lt;/strong&gt; big upfront design (BUFD)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;designs in BUFD cannot possibly be correct as many things will change during the act of programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BUFD inevitable leads to an adversarial relationship between customers and programmers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make design decisions only when you must with the information you have at that time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;postpone decisions until you are absolutely forced to make them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any decision you make in advance on an explicit requirement is just a guess. Preserve your ability to make a decision later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metrics are not direct indicators of quality but are proxies for a deeper measurement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate software metric would be cost per feature over time interval that matters, but this is not easy to calculate. Cost, feature, and time are individually difficult to define, track and measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your goal is to write software with the lowest cost per feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you decision about how much design to do depends on 2 things: your skills and your time frame.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a tradeoff between the amount of time spent designing and the amount of time this design saves in the future (and there is a break-even point).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the act of design prevents software from being delivered on time, you have lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;while it is important to consider the problem and sketch out an overall plan before writing the first test, don’t over think it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can’t figure out what’s right until you write some tests. The purpose of some of your tests might very well be to prove that they represent bad ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code should have the following qualities
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transparent
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the consequences of change should be obvious in the code that is changing and in distant code that relies upon it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reasonable
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small changes in requirements require correspondingly small changes in code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes has no unexpected side effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usable
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;existing code should be usable in new and unexpected contexts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exemplary
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code itself should encourage those who change it to perpetuate these qualities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if you choose the tests and implementations that employ transformations that are higher on the list, you will avoid the impasse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the code go through a sequence of transformation from &lt;strong&gt;specific to generic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when passing a test, prefer higher priority transformations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when posing a test choose one that can be passed with higher priority transformations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when an implementation seems to require a low priority transformation, backtrack to see if there is a simpler test to pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{} -&gt; nil&lt;/code&gt; no code at all -&gt; code that employs nil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as we write the first test &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wrapNullEmptyString()&lt;/code&gt;, we also write the failing implementation which also employs &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;({} -&gt; nil)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nil-&gt;constant&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can make the first test pass by return empty string, which apply &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nil-&gt;constant&lt;/code&gt; transformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(constant-&gt;constant+)&lt;/code&gt;: a simple constant to a more complex constant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can then write the next test that employs &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(constant-&gt;constant+)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;oneShortWordDoesNotWrap() { assertThat(wrap(&quot;word&quot;, 5), is(&quot;word&quot;)) }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(unconditional-&gt;if)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(constant-&gt;scalar)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variable is a generalization of constants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;oneShortWordDoesNotWrap&lt;/code&gt; test pass by using both &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(unconditional-&gt;if)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(constant-&gt;scalar)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;as tests get more specific, code should become more generic&lt;/strong&gt;. Code become more generic by becoming more abstract. One way to make code more abstract is to DRY it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DRY is important but if applied too early, and with too much vigour, it can do more harm than good. It’s a good idea to ask the following questions when doing so:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the change I’m contemplating make the code harder to understand? Be suspicious of any change that muddles the waters?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what is the future cost of doing nothing now?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some changes cost the same regardless of whether you make them now or delay them until later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if it doesn’t increase your costs, delay making changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when will the future arrive, or how soon will I get more information?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s better to tolerate duplication than to anticipate the wrong abstraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing shameless green means optimising for understandability, not changeability, and patiently tolerating duplication if doing so will help reveal the underlying abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;duplication is useful when it supplies independent, specific examples of a general concept that you don’t yet understand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the goal is to use green to maximize your understanding of the problem and to unearth all available information before committing to abstractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the new code muddles rather than clarifies the waters, and it’s important to understand why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green Bar patterns:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fake it (“Till you make it”)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developing habits of writing just enough code to pass the tests forces you to write better tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it also provides an antidote for the hubris of thinking you know what’s right when you’re actually wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obvious implementation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s best to save obvious implementation for very small leaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;triangulate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires writing several tests at once, which means you’ll have multiple simultaneous broken tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the idea is to write one bit of code which makes all of the tests pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;triangulation is meant to force you to converge upon the correct abstraction in your code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the small steps of TDD act to incrementally review the correct implementation, &lt;strong&gt;skipping these incremental steps means you miss the opportunity of being set right&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is song method needed?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;answering this question requires thinking about the problem from the message sender point of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knowledge that one object has about another creates a dependency. Dependencies tie objects together, exacerbating the ost of change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using verses method to request the entire song, however, requires significantly more knowledge. the sender must know
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name of hte verses method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the method requires 2 arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the first argument is the verse on which to start&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the second argument is the verse on which to end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the song starts on verse 99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the song ends on verse 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are many ways in which the verses method could change that would break senders of this message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveal the intention
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the distinction between intention and implementation … allows you to understand a computation first in essence and later, if necessary, in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;song is the intention, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;verses(99,0)&lt;/code&gt; is the implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this test has a major flaw that can cause it toggle from “short and sweet” to “painful and costly” in the blink of an eye. This flaw lies dormant until something changes, so the benefits of writing tests like this accrue to the writer today, while the costs are paid by the unfortunate maintainer in the future.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the test is coupled to the implementation details of song such that it will break if the signature or behavior of verses changes, even if song continues to return the correct lyrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you change an implementation detail while retaining existing behaviour and are then confronted with a sea of unrelated red tests, you’re right to be exasperated. &lt;strong&gt;This is completely avoidable, and a sign that tests are too tightly coupled to code. Such tests impede change and increase costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;song&lt;/code&gt; test should know nothing about how the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Bottles&lt;/code&gt; class produces the song. The clear and unambiguous expectation here is that the song return the complete set of lyrics, and the best way and easiest way to do that is to assert that it does:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_the_whole_song&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  assert_equal expected&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; bottles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;song
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you find the duplication distressing, consider the alternatives. Your choices are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assert that the expected output matches that of some other method.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests are coupled to the implementation, so these dependencies mean changes to the system under test might break the tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assert that the expected output matches a dynamically generated string.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reducing string duplication inside the test would require logic. Regardless of how you do it, any logic here would bind the tests to implementation details and any change to the system under test might break the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assert that the expected output matches a hard-coded string.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not only is the expected output clearly and unambiguously stated, but the test has no dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write tests that remind you the story you once have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deferring design decisions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intentionally depending on interfaces allows you to use tests to put off design decision safely and without penalty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supporting abstractions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests are your record of the interface of every abstraction. They let you put off design decisions and create abstractions to any useful depth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exposing design flaws
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a test requires painful setup, the code expects too much context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the test is hard to write, other objects will find the code difficult to reuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good tests not only tell a story, but they lead, step by step, to a well-organised solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;test are not a place for abstractions, they are the place for concretions. Abstractions belong to the code&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with objects as if they are only and exactly the messages to which they respond lets you design a changeable application, and it is your understanding of the importance of this perspective that allows you to create tests that provide maximum benefit at minimum cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests should concentrate on the incoming or outgoing messages that cross an object’s boundaries. The incoming messages make up the public interface of hte receiving object. The outgoing messages, by definition, are incoming into other objects and so ar part of some other object’s interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the general rule is that objects should make assertions about state only for messages in their own public interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some outgoing messages have no side effects and thus matter only to their senders.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;outgoing messages like this are known as queries and they need not be tested by the sending object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;query messages are part of the public interface of their receiver, which already implements every necessary test of state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many outgoing messages do have side effects (a file gets written, a database record is saved, an action is taken by an observer) upon which your application depends.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proving that a message gets sent is a test of behavior, not state, and involves assertions about the number of times, and with what arguments, the message is sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incoming messages should be tested for the state they return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;if you understand the costs and benefits, feel free to choose any framework that suits you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BDD takes an outside-in approach, creating objects at the boundary of an application and working its way inward, mocking as necessary to supply as-yet-unwritten objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD takes an inside-out approach, usually staring with tests of domain objects and then reusing these newly created domain objects in the tests of adjacent layers of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you tests know more about the internal inside of the object under test, it allows knowledge that should be private eto the object leak into the tests, increasing coupling between them and raising the likelihood that changes the code will require changes in tests.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;incoming messages make up an object’s public interface, the face it presents to the world. these messages need tests because other application objects depend on their signatures and on the results they return.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;if Wheels are expensive to create, the Gear test pays that cost even though it has no interests in Wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an application constructed of tightly coupled, dependent laden objects is like a tapestry where pulling on one thread drags the entire rug along.

&lt;li&gt;when you can’t test object in isolation, it bodes ill for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the diameter method is part of hte public interface of a role, one that might reasonably be named diameterizable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thinking of the injected object as a instance of its role gives you more choices about what kind of Diameterizable to inject into Gear during your tests.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the whole point of dependency injection is that it allows you to substitute different concrete classes without changing existing code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object-oriented design tells you to inject dependencies because it believes that specific concrete classes will vary more than these roles, or conversely, roles will be more stable than the classes from which they were abstracted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your application contains many different diameterizables, you might want to create an idealized one so your tests clearly convey the idea of this role.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if all diameterizables are expensive, you may want to fake a cheap one to make your tests run faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are doing BDD, your application might not yet contain any object that plays this role; you may be forced to manufacture something just to write the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;when diameterizable’s interface changes from diameter to width, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Wheel&lt;/code&gt; get updated but &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gear&lt;/code&gt; does not
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since the dimeterizabledouble is injected, the test continues to pass even though the application is definitely broken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is where the stubbing and mocking could make the tests brittle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“when interface of a role changes, all players of the role must adopt the new interface”, dynamic language like ruby doesn’t complain about the incompatible implementation with the interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;injecting the same objects at test time as are used at runtime ensures that tests break correctly but may lead to long running tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;injecting doubles can speed tests but leaves them vulnerable to constructing a fantasy world where tests work but the application fails&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you can’t get/access the structure you need, then the tests tell you that it’s time to break up the class into more minor/composable features.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the extracted methods form the core of responsibilities of the new object and so make up its public interface, which is (theoretically) stable and thus safe to depend upon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests of private methods are therefore coupled to application code that is likely to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since tests provide documentation about the object under test, it could mislead others into using them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never write private methods, and if you do, never ever test them, unless of course it makes sense to do so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;outgoing messages are either queries or commands. Query messages matter only to the object that sends them, while command messages have effects that are visible to other objects in your application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignoring query messages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s redundant for Gear to duplicate correctness tests from Wheel, maintainance costs will increase if it does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proving command messages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes, it does matter that the message get sent and the object under test is responsible for sending the message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your tests must prove that the command messages got sent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you have proactively injected dependencies, you can easily substitute mocks. Setting expectations on these mocks allows you to prove that the object under test fulfills its responsibilities without duplicating assertions that belong else where&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the point of view of the object under test, every other object is a role, and dealing with objects as if they representative of the roles they play loosens coupling and increases flexibility, both in your application and in your tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you fear that human communication will be insufficient to keep all players of a role in sync, write the tests.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;confirming subclass behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;confirming superclass enforcement
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bicycle&lt;/code&gt; class should raise an error if a subclass does not implement &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;default_tire_size&lt;/code&gt;. Even though this requirement applies to subclasses, the actual enforcement behavior is in Bicycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_forces_subclasses_to_implement_default_tire_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  assert_raises&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@bike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;default_tire_size &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testing concrete subclass behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s important to test these specializations without embedding knowledge of the superclass into the test.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RoadBikeTest&lt;/code&gt; should ensure that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;local_spares&lt;/code&gt; works while maintaining deliberate ignorance about the existance of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;spares&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testing abstract super class behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can stub the behavior that would normally be supplied by subclasses (follow liskov substitution principle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be especially careful when testing subclass specializations to prevent knowledge of the superclass from leaking down into the subclass’s test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the problem is solved, and you choose to refactor now rather than later, you pay the opportunity cost of not being able to work on other problems
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spending time “improving” code based purely on aesthetics may not be the best use of your precious time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need for change imposes higher standards on the affected code. &lt;strong&gt;Code that never changes obviously doesn’t need to be changable, but once a new requirement arrives, the bar is raised&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;code is open to a new requirement when you can meet the new requirement without changing the existing code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;when faced with a new requirement, first rearrange the existing code such that it’s open to the new feature, and once that’s complete, then add the new code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the trick to successfully improving code that contains many flaws is to isolate and correct them one at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are unclear about how to make it open, the way forward is to start removing code smells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you should never change tests during a refactoring, if your tests are flawed such that they interfere with refactoring, improve them first, and then refactor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rules
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select the things that are most alike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find the smallest difference between them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the simplest change that will remove that difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as you follow the flocking rules
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change only 1 line at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run the tests after every change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the tests fail, undo and make a better change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes to code can be subdivided into 4 distinct steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parse the new code: confirm the syntax is valid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parse/execute step: proving that code runs without blowing up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parse/execute and use its result: ensure that it returns the correct result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete unused code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Flocking&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the group’s behavior is the result of a continuous series of small decisions being made by each participating individual. These decisions are guided by three simple rules
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alignment - steer towards the average heading of neighbors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separation - don’t get too close to a neighbor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cohesion - steer towards the average position of the flock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the “flocking rules” for code allow abstractions to appear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making existing code open to a new requirement often requires identifying and naming abstractions. The flocking rules concentrate on turning difference into sameness, and thus are useful tools for unearthing abstractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;converging-on-abstractions&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#converging-on-abstractions&quot; aria-label=&quot;converging on abstractions permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;converging on abstractions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focusing on difference
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DRYing out sameness has some value, but DRYing out difference has more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encapsulating the concept that varies, a theme of many design patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;difference holds the key to understanding. If 2 concrete examples represent the same abstraction and they contain a difference, that difference must represent a smaller abstraction with a larger one. if you can name the difference, you’ve identified that smaller abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simplifying a hard problem
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many programmers gravitate towards starting a problem at its most confusing part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solving easy problems, through a magical alchemy of code, sometimes transmutes hard problems into easy ones. It is common to find that hard problems are hard only because the easy ones have not yet been solved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;naming concepts
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;general rule and new requirement can help in the struggle for a name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name you choose will be the name you use in conversations with your customers. Naming things after domain concepts improves communication between you and the folks who pay the bills. Only good can come of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notice the following difference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token command-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token command string&quot;&gt;`${number -1} bottle of bear on the wall.\n`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token command-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token command string&quot;&gt;`${number -1} bottles of beer on the wall.\n`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;- what the words &quot;bottle&quot; and &quot;bottles&quot; represent in the context of the song?
  - within the context of song, &quot;bottle/bottles&quot; does not represent pluralization.
  - the new requirement involve with the need to say &quot;six pack&quot; instead of &quot;bottle/bottles&quot;. The string &quot;six pack&quot; is one more concrete example of the underlying abstraction.
  - the general rule is that the name of a thing should be one level of abstraction higher than the thing itself. The strings &quot;bottle/bottles/six-pack&quot; are instances of some category, and the task is to name that category using language of the domain
  - one way to identify category is to imagine the concrete examples as rows and columns in a spreadsheet
  - the header &quot;number&quot; is a level of abstract higher than the concrete examples. &quot;1&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; are numbers
  - container is meaningful, understandable and unambiguous.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;xxx?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bottle&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;six-pack&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;n&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bottles&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#follow-the-flocking-rules&quot;&gt;follow the flock rule&lt;/a&gt; example
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add new container method with 1 line return &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bottles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replace the first client code to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;container()&lt;/code&gt; method instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bottles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add parameter argument &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expand the code in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;container&lt;/code&gt; to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; to decide which of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bottle&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bottles&lt;/code&gt; to return
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;could be expressed in ternary form as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number === 1? &quot;bottle&quot;: &quot;bottles&quot; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change other references to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;container&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a class &lt;strong&gt;must have data and behavior (methods)&lt;/strong&gt;. If one of these is missing, the code doesn’t belong to a class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rephrase every one of its methods as a question, asking the question ought to make sense.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Please Mr. Gear, what is your ratio?” - makes sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Please Mr. Gear, what is your tire size?” - Doesn’t make sense = does not belong here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe the class in 1 sentence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;class should do the smallest possible useful thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the description contains the words “and” or “or”, it means that the class has more than one responsibility
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gear’s responsibility: “calculate the effect that a gear has on a bicycle”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depend on behavior (methods), not data&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never call @variables inside methods, use wrapper methods instead
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/serodriguez68/poodr-notes/blob/master/code_examples/chapter_2.rb#L61-**L71**&quot;&gt;wrong code example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data very often has behavior that you don’t yet know about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hide data structures&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the class uses complex data structures, write wrapper methods that decipher the structure and depend on those methods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/serodriguez68/poodr-notes/blob/master/code_examples/chapter_2.rb#L105-L117&quot;&gt;wrong code example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it trades indexing into a structure for sending messages to an object. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wheelify&lt;/code&gt; method above isolates the messy structural information and DRYs out the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extract extra responsibilities from methods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;methods with single responsibility have these benefits
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clarify what hte class does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid the need for comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourage reuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to move to another class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask questions about what they do and try to describe their responsibilities in a single sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separating iteration from the action that’s being performed on each element (common case of single responsibility in methods)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t decide; preserve your ability to make a decision later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concentrate on the primary class. Decide on its responsibilities and enforce your decision fiercely. If you identify extra responsibilities that you cannot yet remove, isolate them. Do not allow extraneous responsibilities to leak into your class
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;good public interface structure

&lt;li&gt;objects reveals as little of themselves as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;objects know as little of their neighbors as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Result: plugable, component-like objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveals the class’s primary responsibility
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the public interface should correspond to the class’s responsibility. A single responsibility may require multiple public methods. However, too many loosely related public methods can be a sign of single responsibility violation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;focus on messages, not domain objects (classes)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you don’t send messages because you have objects, you have objects because you send message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design experts notice domain objects without concentrating on them; they focus not on these objects but on the messages that pass between them. These messages are guides that lead you to discover other objects, ones that are just as necessary but far less obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Using sequence diagram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lightweight way of acquiring a design intention about an interaction. It provides a simple way to experiment with different object arrangements and message passing schemes between objects. It brings clarity to your thoughts and provide a vehicle to collaborate and communicate with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;should this receiver be responsible for responding to this message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I need to send this message, who should respond to it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: asking for “what” instead of telling “how”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I know what I want, I trust you to do your part&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;use messages to discover objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;it’s completely reasonable that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; would send &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;suitable_trips&lt;/code&gt; message. It is exactly what &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; wants. The problem is not with the sender, it is with the receiver. You have not yet identified an object whose responsibility it is to implement this method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sequence diagram keep the focus on messages and allow you to form a rational intention about the first thing to assert in a test. Switching your attention from objects to messages allows you to concentrate on designing an application built upon public interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;method in the public interface should
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be explicitly identified as such&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be more about what than how&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have names that, so far as you can anticipate, will not change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take a hash as an options parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create test for public interfaces.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not test private methods. If you must, segregate those test from the ones of the public methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your design forces the use of a private method in another class, re-think your design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dependency on a private method of an external framework is a form of technical debt&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you must depend on private interface, use &lt;a href=&quot;../manage-dependencies/index.md#isolate-the-dependency&quot;&gt;isolate the dependency&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this prevent calls from multiple places&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;create public methods that allow senders to get what they want without knowing how your class does it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you fae a class with an ill-defined public interface you have these options
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define a new well-defined method for that class’ public interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a wrapper class with a well defined public interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a single wrapping method and put it in your own class&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you simultaneously change many things and something breaks, you’re forced to understand everything in order to fix anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making a slew of simultaneous changes is not refactoring - it’s rehacktoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gradual cutover refactoring
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a strategy for keeping the code in a releasable state by gradually switching over a small number of pieces at a time. This type of refactoring can be done alongside other development work without affecting the release schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let red be your guide. If you take a giant step and the tests begin to fail, undo and fall back to making smaller changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;real refactoring is comfortingly predictable, and saves brainpower for more thought provoking challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the non-default branch is implemented first, the default has to be set to something that actually meets the condition and so makes the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; branch execute.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, implementing the non-default branch first places a slightly greater burden on you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seeking stable landing points
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code is read many more times than it is written, so anything that increases understandability lowers costs. Next, and just as important, consistent code enables future refactorings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taking bigger steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you take bigger steps and the tests begin to fail, there’s something about the problem that you don’t understand, if this happens, don’t push forward and refactor under red. Undo, return to green, and make incremental changes until you regain clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discovering deeper abstractions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;successor&lt;/code&gt; is important, and separating it from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;quantity&lt;/code&gt; gives both methods a single responsibility if you conflate &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;choosing-what-to-sing-for-any-number(quantity)&lt;/code&gt; with deciding-what-verse-to-sing-next(successor), the resulting method would be harder to understand, future refactorings would be more difficult, and attempts to change the code for 1 idea might accidentally break it for other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the challenge is identifying the current concept and coming up with a good name.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It must represent a smaller abstraction within that larger one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;names should neither be too general nor too specific. For example, thing is too broad, and ItOrOne too narrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when perfect name for a concept is elusive, there are couple strategies moving forward
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time box 5 - 10 minutes to ponder, and then use the best name that you can come up with (usually with thesaurus in hand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instantly choose a meaningless name like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;. Like there is no point wasting time thinking about it now, the name will be obvious later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can ask someone else, like fellow programmers or customers for help.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;deriving names from responsibilities
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus on the difference and find abstraction one level higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when creating an abstraction, first describe its responsibility as you understand it at the moment, then choose a name which reflects the responsibility. The effort you put into selecting good names right now pays off by making it easier to recognize perfect names later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every piece of knowledge is a dependency, and the way that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;quantity&lt;/code&gt; is written requires verse to know too many things. If &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;quantity&lt;/code&gt; were more trustworthy, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;verse&lt;/code&gt; could know less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the idea of reducing the number of dependencies imposed upon message senders by requiring the receivers return trustworthy objects is a generalization of the Liskov Substitution Principle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liskov, in plain terms, requires that objects be what they promise they are. When using inheritance, you must be able to freely substitute an instance of a subclass for an instance of its superclass. Subclasses, by definitions, are all their superclasses, plus more, so this substitution should always work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liskov violations force message senders to have knowledge of the various return types, and to either treat them differently or convert them into something consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abstraction provide name for the consolidated code, allowing the name to be as a shortcut for an idea, independent of its current implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the abstractions tell you where your code relies upon an idea. But to get this benefit, you must refer to an abstraction in every place where it applies.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appreciating immutability
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;immutable objects are easy to understand and to reason about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because they are easy to reason about, immutable objects are also easy to test. Tests for immutable objects avoid extra setup, which makes the tests cheaper to write and easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another key virtue of immutable objects is that they are thread safe. You can’t break shared state if shared state doesn’t change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the best programming strategy is to write the simplest code possible and measure its performance once you’re done. If the whole is not acceptably fast, profile the performance, and speed up the slowest parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your goal is to optimize for easy of understanding while maintaining performane that’s fast enough. Don’t sacrifice readability before having solid performance data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the truth about refactoring is that it sometimes makes things worse, in which case your efforts serve gallantly to disprove an idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s entirely possible that you do not yet know what change will make it open. At this point, you must decide whether it’s better to proceed with additional modifications to teh code, or better to revert the previous change and take a different tack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you must continue to be guided by code smells, and doing so requires that you identify the smells in the current code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;superfluous differences raises the cost of reading code, and increases the difficulty of future refactorings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identifying patterns in code
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one way to get better at identifying smells is to practice describing the characteristics/patterns of code. Including any patterns that you see, and things you like, hate, or don’t understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the following questions draw attention to a number of interesting characteristics of the code as it’s written so far:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do any method have the same shape?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do any method take an argument of the same name?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do argument of the same name always mean the same thing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you were going to break this class into 2 pieces, where’s the dividing line?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do the tests in the conditionals have any thing in common?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how many branches do the conditionals have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do the methods contain any code other than the conditional?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does each method depend more on the argument that got passed, or on the class as a whole?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these eight questions group certain methods together. The same-shaped, same kind of conditional testing, bottle number taking, argument-depending, flocked five methods fall into one group, and the song, verses, and verse methods into another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trust the process
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you adhere to a recipe and tests start failing, it’s likely that there’s something about the problem that you don’t yet understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insisting upon messages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as an oo practitioner, when you see a conditional, the hairs on your neck should stand up. You should feel entitled to send messages to objects. It means that objects are missing and suggests that subsequent refactorings are needed to reveal them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborators must be brought together in useful combinations, and assembling these combinations requires knowing which objects are suitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s a big difference between a conditional that selects the correct object and one that supplies behavior. The first is acceptable and generally unavaidable. THe second suggests that you’re missing objects in your domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;squint test rule
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put the code of interest on your screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lean back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;squint your eyes such that you can still see the code, but can no longer read it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change in shape, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change in color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes in indentation reveal the presense of conditionals, the more nested level of conditionals, the more complexed/complicated the code site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes in color indicate difference in the level of abstraction. A method that intermixes many colors tells a story that will be difficult to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analyzing the “flocked five” (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;quantity&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;container&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;action&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pronoun&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;successor&lt;/code&gt;) using the above questions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do any methods have the same shape?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they all have the same shape according to squint tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do any methods take an argument of the same name?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yes, the flocked five methods take number as an argument and the arguments represent the bottle number rather than a verse number from the argument number of verse method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;having multiple methods that take the same argument (indicate duplicate concept, not duplicate name) is a code smell. In an ideal world, each different concept would have its own unique, precise name, and there would be no ambiguity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you were going to break this class into 2 pieces, where’s the dividing line?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after verse and before the flocked five methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do the tests in the conditionals have anything in common?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; to be exactly equal to another value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;testing for equality has several benefits over the alternatives. Most obviously, it narrows the range of things that meet condition. This reduces the difficulty of debugging errors. Testing of equality also makes the code more precise, and this precision enables future refactorings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how many branches do the conditionals have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do the methods contain any code other than the conditional?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do methods that take &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; as an argument depend more on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;, or more on the class as a whole?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primitive obsession&lt;/em&gt; is when you use one of the built-in data types to represent a concept in your domain. Obsessing on a primitive results in code that passes built-in types around and supplies behavior for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;em&gt;Extract class&lt;/em&gt; to create a home for the domain concepts in place of the primitive.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;it’s easy to imagine creating objects that stand in for things, but the power of OO is that it lets you model ideas, things that don’t physically exist. Modellable ideas often lie dormant in interactions between objects.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your code starts with a concrete class

&lt;p&gt;“only talk to your immediate neighbors”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Inheritance is for &lt;strong&gt;specialization&lt;/strong&gt;, NOT for sharing code”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“no matter how complicated the code, the receiving object ultimately handles any message in one of two ways. It either responds directly or it passes the message on to some other object for a response.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;practice TDD as a design technique and not only as a testing technique.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strangely, if we try to practise TDD as only a testing technique, then eventually we will become bored by our own defects and begin to notice “this code is annoying to test”, which points to design problems. After that, we’re practising TDD also as a design technique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software development as a learning process.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expose uncertainly early by testing our assumption as early as possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we use mock objects to identify the essential interactions between modules/objects. This leads to more effective abstractions, which reduces the cost of changing the software safely over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stub queries; expect actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write code that depends as little as possible on its context. It leads to more reusable code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;programming by intention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development as a learning process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best approach a team can take is to use empirical feedback to learn about the system and its use and then apply it back to the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development is incremental and iterative.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incremental development builds a system feature by feature. Each feature is implemented as an end-to-end slice. As a result, the system is continuously integrated and ready for deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A system is deployable when the acceptance tests all pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External quality&lt;/strong&gt; is how well the system meets the needs of its customer and users. It’s usually part of the contract to build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal quality&lt;/strong&gt; is how well the system meets the needs of its developers and administrators. The point of maintaining internal quality is to allow us to modify the system’s behaviour safely and predictably because it minimizes the risk that a change will force significant rework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running end-to-end tests tells us about the external quality. Writing them tells us something about how well we understand the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An object-oriented system: A web of collaborating objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Values vs objects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a value represents some fixed quantity or measurement, and it is immutable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an object, on the other hand, is an identity that might change state over time. It models a computational process or a stateful behaviour of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The communication between the objects can be seen through tests. So don’t try to model your system based on the entities (objects) alone, but on the communication between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objects follow common communication patterns. The domain model is in these communication patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An object is an implementation of one or more roles:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;roles are a set of related responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;responsibilities is an obligation to perform a task or know information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collaboration is an interaction of objects or roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An object communicates by messages: it receives messages from other objects. It reacts by sending messages to other objects as well, as perhaps, returning a value or exception to the original sender. An object has a method of handling every type of message that it understands. In most cases, it encapsulates some internal state that it uses to coordinate its communication with other objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the intention of every test clear: distinguish between the tested functionality, the supporting infrastructure, and the object structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;write unit tests for object behaviour rather than the object’s methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something that is difficult to test is probably poorly designed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The single responsibility principle
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;of the heuristic is that we should be able to describe what an object does without using any conjunction (“and,” “or”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interacting with the composite object should be more straightforward than interacting with the components that it composes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The empty interface is sometimes used to mark a domain concept and show how it’s used in collaboration. Later, as we grow the code, we fill in the interface with methods to describe its behaviour.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only mock types that you own:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t use mocks for third-party code since it is usually not changeable as you don’t have control over it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an adapter layer to implement interactions with third-party code. We test these adapters with focused integration tests to confirm our understanding of how the third-party API works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We must focus on integrating our design and the external code. In integration, we have an abstraction to implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we must check that we’re using the third-party API correctly and adjust our abstract to fit if we find that our assumptions are incorrect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some exceptions where mocking third-party libraries can be helpful:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we might use mocks to simulate behaviour that is hard to trigger with the library such as testing a sequence of calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use interfaces to name roles played by objects and describe the messages they’ll accept. Keep interfaces as narrow as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use interfaces to define the available messages between objects, but we also need to express their communication protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we use TDD with mock objects as a technique to make these communication protocols visible, as a tool for discovering them during development and as a description when revisiting the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD with mock objects also encourages information hiding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if similar interfaces represent different concepts, we can make a point of making them distinct.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decision to separate similar-looking interfaces is an excellent time to reconsider their naming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another time to consider refactoring interfaces is when we start implementing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To run an initial end-to-end test that fails is already a lot of work. However, deploying and testing right from the start of a project forces the team to understand how their system fits into the world. it flushes out the “unknown.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a drawing of the system’s structure on the whiteboard where it’s visible for the whole team, and keep it in mind while coding! Then, make the smallest number of decisions you can to kick-start the TDD cycle. Then, we’ll learn and improve from honest feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test as a walking skeleton
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a walking skeleton implements the thinnest possible slice of actual functionality that we can automatically build, deploy, and test end-to-end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including the deployment step in the testing process is critical for two reasons
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid the error-prone manual activity of deploying the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flush out the risks in operating the software (like six weeks and four signatures to set up a database, we want to know now, not two weeks before delivery.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;context of the first test
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand the problem -&gt; broad-brush design (architecture) -&gt; automate: build, deployment, end-to-end tests -&gt; deployable system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we have no guarantees that the decisions we’ve made about the design of our application are right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our ideal situation is where the team regularly releases a real production system. This allows the system’s stakeholders to respond to how well the system meets their needs, at the same time allowing us to judge its implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we use the automation of building and testing to give us feedback on the qualities of the system
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the automated deployment helps us frequently release to real users, which gives us feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the great benefit is that we will be able to make changes in response to whatever we learn from feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose uncertainty early by testing our assumptions as early as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the essential structure of a test:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating any required mock objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create any natural objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specify how you expect the mock objects to be called by the target object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call the triggering method on the target object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assert that any resulting values are valid and that all the expected calls have been made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start each feature with an acceptance test
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we write the acceptance using only terminology from the application’s domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the precision of expression requirements in a form that can be automatically checked helps us uncover implicit assumptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start testing with the simplest success case
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we find it helpful to keep a notepad or index card by the keyboard to jot down failure cases, refactorings, and other technical tasks that need to be addressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write the test that you’d want to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch the test fail
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when we get the right failure, we check that the diagnostics are helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We adjust the test code and rerun the tests until the error messages guide us to the problem with the code.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error message checks our assumptions about the code we’ve been working on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;emphasis on expressing our intentions is fundamental for developing reliable, maintainable systems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop from the inputs to the outputs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start developing the feature by considering the events that trigger the new behaviour in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will need to write one or more objects to handle these events. We discover that these objects need supporting services from the rest of the system. In this way, we work our way through the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;unit test behaviour, not methods&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one common mistake is thinking about testing methods. We do better when we focus on the object’s features under test should provide. It helps to choose test names that describe how the object behaves in the tested scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps to name the test by describing the required behaviour in a specific scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best we can get from the testing part of TDD is &lt;strong&gt;the confidence that we can change the code without breaking it. Fear kills progress. The trick is to make sure that the confidence is justified.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we grow our systems a slice of functionality at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we use two principle heuristics to guide this structuring:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separation of concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher levels of abstraction
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That’s why most people order food from a menu in terms of dishes, rather than the detail of the recipes used to create them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In its terminology, we write interfaces to describe its relationships with the outside world (Cockburn’s ports). Then we write bridges between the application core and each technical domain (Cockburn’s adapters). The bridges implement the interfaces defined by the application model and map between application-level and technical-level objects.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code for the business domain is isolated from its dependencies on technical infrastructures, such as databases and user interfaces. We don’t want technical concepts to leak into the application model, so we write interfaces to describe their relationships with the outside world in its terminology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encapsulation ensures that the behaviour of an object can only be effected through its API. Information hiding conceals how an object implements its functionality behind the abstraction of its API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we follow standard practices to maintain encapsulation when coding:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define immutable value types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid global variables and singletons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copy collections and mutable values when passing between objects, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t share a reference/pointer to a mutable object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t use global variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t use singletons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single responsibility principle: every object should have a single, clearly defined responsibility. We should describe what an object does without using any conjunctions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composite simpler than the sum of its parts,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the API of a composite object should not be more complicated than of any of its components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we grow the code, the composing more straightforward rules raise abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“One domain vocabulary” rule: don’t use a term from another domain’s vocabulary unless you’re a bridging layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiding the correct information. Encapsulation is almost always a good thing to do, but sometimes information can be hidden in the wrong place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an interface named Service and an implementation called ServiceImpl is probably a sign of bad design. The interface should be described in general domain language, and the implementation should have something specific about it to use in the name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;domain types are better than strings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when we take the trouble to express the domain clearly, we often find more options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This style produces more flexible code because it’s easy to swap objects with the same role. The caller sees nothing of their internal structure or the rest of the system behind the role interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When messages are trusting and ask for what the sender wants instead of telling receiver how to behave, objects naturally evolve public interfaces that are flexible and reusable in novel and unexpected ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we ask when
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting information from values and collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using a factory to create new objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;searching or filtering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can specify how we expect the target object to communicate with its mock for a triggering event -&gt; expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we can use the test to help us tease out the supporting roles our object needs, defined as Java interfaces, and fill in actual implementations as we develop the rest of the system -&gt; interface discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;only talk to your immediate neighbors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;certain “violations” of demeter reduce your application’s flexibility and maintainability, while others make perfect sense. Additionally, violations typically lead to objects that require lots of context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the definition “only use one dot” is not always right. There are cases that use multiple dots that do not violate Demeter
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;access distant attribute&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;customer.bicycle.wheel.tire&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it may be cheapest in your specific case to reach through intermediate objects than to go around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider moving behavior using that tire attribute to wheel object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;invokes distant behavior&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;customer.bicycle.wheel.rotate&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cost is high. This violation should be removed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hash.keys.sort.join(&apos;,&apos;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no violation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hash.keys.sort.join&lt;/code&gt; actually returns an Enumerable of Strings, all of the intermediate objects have the same type and there is no Demeter violation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delegation removes visible violations but ignores demeter’s spirit. Using delegation to hide tight coupling is not the same as decoupling code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;demeter violations are clues of missing objects whose public interface you have not yet discovered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you shift to a message-based perspective, the messages you find will become public interfaces in the objects they lead you to discover. However, if you are bound by the shackles of existing domain objects, you will end up assembling their existing public interfaces into long message chains and thus will miss the opportunity to find and construct flexible public interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;when an object becomes complex, that’s a sign that it’s implementing multiple concerns and that we can break out coherent units of behaviour into helper types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally is better to treat this code as a spike: once we know what to do, just roll it back and re-implement it cleanly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break up an object if it becomes too large to test easily or if its test failures become challenging to interpret. Then unit tests the new parts separately&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Budding off”&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when we want to mark a new domain concept in the code, we often introduce a placeholder type that wraps a single field. With each class that we add, we’re raising the level of abstraction of the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid adding new behaviour that doesn’t belong to an object, we can create an interface to define the service that the object needs from the object’s point of view. Then, we write tests for the new behaviour as if the service already exists, using mock objects to help describe the relationship between the target object and its new collaborator. We think of this as an on-demand design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The placeholder for a new object will be filled in with later implementation details. For example, when writing a test, we ask ourselves, “If this worked, who would know?”, if the correct answer to that question is not in the target object, it’s probably time to introduce a new collaborator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Bundling up”:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating a new object for a group of objects always used together. When the test for an object becomes too complicated to set up, […] consider bundling up some collaborating objects.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new object hides the complexity in an abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to give the new entity a name that helps us understand the domain better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can scope the dependencies more clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can be more precise with our unit testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;services that the object requires from its peers to perform its responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should not be possible to create the object without them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peers that need to be kept up to date with the object’s activity. Notifications are “fire and forget.” Notifications are so helpful because they decouple objects from each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;adjustments&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#adjustments&quot; aria-label=&quot;adjustments permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Adjustments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peers that adjust the object’s behaviour to the broader needs of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This includes policy objects that make decisions on the object’s behalf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partially creating an object and then finishing it off by setting properties is brittle because the programmer must remember to put all the dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notifications and adjustments can be passed to the constructor as a convenience. Alternatively, they can be initialized to safe defaults and overwritten later. For example, adjustments can be initialized to shared values and notifications to a null object or an empty collection. We then add methods to allow callers to change these default values and add or remove listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;compose objects to describe system behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD at the unit test level guides us to decompose our system into value types and loosely coupled computational objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can provide a description (the intention of the collaboration) of the expected calls for a test in a context by declaring the expectation of a mock object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The advantage of this approach is that we have a flexible application structure from relatively little code. It’s particularly suitable where the code has to support many related scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just assigning and linking objects doesn’t help us understand the system’s assembling behaviour. Instead, the information we care about is typically buried in a morass of keywords, setters, punctuation, and the like.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To battle with this, we can organize the code into two layers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;implementation layer&lt;/strong&gt;: graph of objects, its behaviour is the combined result of how its objects respond to events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The declarative layer
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is, in effect, a small domain-specific language embedded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the declarative layer that describes what the code will do. In contrast, the implementation layer defines how the code does it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The different purposes of the two layers mean that we use a different coding style for each. For the implementation layer, we stick to the conventional object-oriented style guidelines. For the declarative layer, we’re more flexible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;most of the time. Such a declarative layer merges from continual merciless refactoring. Taking care to notice when an area of code is not clear, we add or move structure until it is&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delegate to subordinate objects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;started writing the test we wanted to see and then filling in the supporting objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;start from a statement of the problem and see where it goes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the alternative is to write code directly in the tests and then refactor out any clusters of behaviours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;context-independence&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#context-independence&quot; aria-label=&quot;context independence permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Context independence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A system is easier to change if its objects are context-independent: each object has no built-in knowledge about the system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect of the context-independence rule on a system of objects is to make their relationships explicit, defined separately from the objects themselves. This simplifies the objects and manages the relationships&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’ just extract parameters on details.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Golden Rule of TDD: Never write new functionality without a failing test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Object-oriented design focuses more on the communication between objects than on the objects themselves.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Objects make their decisions based only on the information they hold internally or that which came with the triggering message.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“break up an object if it becomes too large to test easily, or if its test failures become difficult to interpret. Then unit tests the new parts separately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When writing a test, we ask ourselves, “If this worked, who would know?”, if the right answer to that question is not in the target object, it’s probably time to introduce a new collaborator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the test for an object is too complicated to set up […] consider bundling up some of the collaborating objects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing forces us to understand a process better than trying to automate it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Expect unexpected changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each object should have no built-in knowledge about the system in which it executes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The big idea is `messaging’ … the key in the making great, and growable systems is much more to design how its modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and behaviours should be”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Iteration Zero in most agile projects, there’s a first stage where the team sets up its physical and technical environments. A common practice is to call this step iteration (the team still needs to time-box its activities) zero (before functional development starts in iteration one). One important task for iteration zero is to use the walking skeleton to test-drive the initial architecture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the legends say, if we have something’s true name, we can control it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the string is a stark data structure, and everywhere it is passed, there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we take the trouble to express the domain clearly, we often find that we have more options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“try to follow the four-step TDD cycle (fail, report (make the diagnostics clear), pass, refactor).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“test doubles are fine, but don’t stop there if you can invert the dependency and turn expectations into stubs… or even better, replace the stub with the value it returns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no broad tests are required. The test suite consists of “narrow” tests focused on specific concepts. Although wide integration tests can be added as a safety net, their failure indicates a gap in the main test suite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;easy refactoring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no magic. Tools that automatically remove busywork, such as dependency-injection and auto-mock frameworks, are not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a silver bullet. Design mistakes are inevitable, requiring continuous attention to design and refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;benefits from learning to listen to test smell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep knowledge local. The “magic” need to create mocks could cause the knowledge to leak between components.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if we can keep knowledge local to an object (either internal or passed in), then its implementation is independent of its context. So we can safely move it where we like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do this consistently, and your application, built out of pluggable components, will be easy to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it’s explicit, we can name it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid mocking concrete classes that can help us give names to the relationships between objects and the objects themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the legends say, if we have something’s true name, we can control it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if we can see it, we have a better chance of finding its other uses and reducing duplication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more names mean more domain information
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we find that when we emphasize how objects communicate rather than what they are, we end up with types and roles defined more in terms of domain than the implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we seem to get more domain vocabulary into the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This might be because we have a more significant number of smaller abstractions, which gets us further away from the underlying language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pass behaviour rather than data&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we find that by applying “Tell, Don’t Ask” consistently, we end up with a coding style where we tend to pass behaviour (in the form of callbacks) into the system instead of pulling values up through the call stack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this keeps the tests and the code clean as we go. It helps to ensure that we understand our domain and reduces the risk of being unable to cope when a new requirement triggers changes to the design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a unit test shouldn’t be 1000 lines long! It should focus on at most a few classes and should not need to create a large fixture or perform lots of preparation to get the objects into a state where the target feature can be exercised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from xUnit patterns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obscure Tests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;confuse the differences between test cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;single test case exercises multiple features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can’t skim-read the tests to understand the intention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uses magic numbers but are not clear about what, if anything, is significant about those values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests with lots of code for setting up and handling exceptions, which buries their essential logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mocking values
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mock value object means that we want to describe the behaviour of the interface explicitly, and we can’t think of a name for the concrete implementation of the interface/class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when there isn’t a good implementation name. It might mean that the interface is poorly named or designed. Perhaps it’s unfocused because it has too many responsibilities, or it’s named after its implementation rather than its role in the client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s a value, not an object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re tempted to mock a value because it’s too complicated to set up an instance, consider writing a builder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;partial mocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test diagnostics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mocking concrete classes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid override behaviour in testable subclass
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it leaves the relationship between objects implicit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we subclass, there’s nothing in the domain code to make such a relationship visible - just methods on an object. This makes it hard to see if the service that supports this relationship might be relevant elsewhere, and we’ll have to do the analysis again next time we work with the class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we mock a concrete class, we force client objects to depend on interfaces they do not use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, extract an interface as part of our test-driven development process. It will push us to think up a name to describe the relationship we’ve just discovered. This makes us think harder about the domain and teases out concepts we might otherwise miss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can’t get/access the structure you need, the tests tell you that it’s time to break up the class into more minor, composable features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bloated constructor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some arguments define a concept that should be packaged up and replaced with a new object to represent it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being sensitive to complexity in the tests can help us clarify our designs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for arguments always used together in a class and those with the same lifetime. Give it a good name to explain the concept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confused object
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too large because it has too many responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it would likely has a bloated constructor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another associated smell is that its test suite will look confused. The tests for its various features will have no relationship with each other. We cannot make significant changes in one area without touching others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too many dependencies
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dependencies should be passed into the constructor, but notifications and adjustments can be set to defaults and reconfigured later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialized the peers to standard defaults, the user can configure them later through the user interface, and we can configure them in our unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too many expectations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can’t tell what’s significant and what’s just there to get through the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can make our intentions clearer by distinguishing between stubs simulations of actual behaviour that help us get the test to pass and expectations, assertions we want to make about how an object interacts with its neighbours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow queries and expect commands
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commands are calls that are likely to have side effects, to change the world outside the target object. queries don’t change the world, so they can be called any number of times, including none&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rule helps to decouple the test from the tested object. So if the implementation changes, for example, to introduce caching or use a different algorithm, the test is still valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many expectations indicate that we’re trying to test too large a unit or locking down too many of the object’s interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;constructing complex test data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing persistence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests with threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing asynchronous code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seeding DB data everywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;magic injection of objects and data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overlapping sociable tests (constructing entire dependency chain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test brittleness
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the tests are too tightly coupled to unrelated parts of the system or irrelevant behaviour of the object(s) they’re testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests overspecify the expected behaviour of the target code, constraining it more than necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is duplication when multiple tests exercise the same production code behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;beware of flickering tests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a test can fail intermittently if its timeout is too close to the time the tested behaviour typically takes to run or if it doesn’t synchronize correctly with the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flickering tests can mask actual defects. We need to make sure that we understand what the real problem is before we ignore flickering tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;allow flickering tests is terrible for the team. It breaks the quality culture where things should “just work,” Even a few flickering tests can make the team stop paying attention to broken builds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it also breaks the habits of feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we should be paying attention to why the tests are flickering and whether that means improving the design of both the tests and code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runaway tests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be careful when an asynchronous test asserts that the system returns to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless it also asserts that the system enters an intermediate state before asserting the initial state, the test will run ahead of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lost updates
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a significant difference between tests that sample and those that listen for events is that polling can miss state changes that are later overwritten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the test can record notifications from the system, it can look through its records to find essential notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to be reliable, a sampling test must ensure that its system is stable before triggering any further interactions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid irrelevant information and make the cause-effect relationship between the fixture and verification logic clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test names describe features (high-level languages and abstractions)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think of one coherent feature per test, which might be represented by up to a handful of assertions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a single test seems to be making assertions about different features of a target object, it might be worth splitting up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a common approach is to name a test after the method it’s exercising
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at best, such names duplicate the information a developer could get just by looking at the target class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we don’t need to know that TargetObject has a “choose” method, &lt;strong&gt;we need to know what the object does in different situations, what the method is for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a better alternative is to name tests in terms of the target object’s features.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TestDox convention: Each test name reads like a sentence, with the target class as the implicit subject.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a List holds items in the other they were added: holdsItemsInTheOrderTheyWereAdded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the point of the convention is to encourage the developer to think about what the target object does, not what it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing the tests, some developers start with the test name first, and some begin to create a placeholder for the test names before writing any test codes. Both approaches work as long as the test is, in the end, consistent and expressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read documentation generated from tests (provide a fresh perspective on the test names, highlighting the problems we’re too close to the code to see)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arrange/act/assert structure is not clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write in order: test names/act/assert/arrange to help us focus on what to write and avoid being coupled to the low technical implementation details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasize the what over the how.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the more implementation detail is included in a test method, the harder it is for the reader to understand what’s important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use structure to explain and share
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jMock syntaxes are designed to allow developers to compose small features into a (more or less) readable description of an assertion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be careful in factoring out test structure, where the test becomes so abstract that we cannot see what it does anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our most significant concern is making the test describe what the target code does, so we refactor enough to see its flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accentuate the positive. Only catch exceptions in a test if we want to assert something about them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delegate to subordinate objects as mentioned in the programming by intention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assertions and expectations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the assertions and expectations of a test should communicate precisely what matters in the behaviour of the target code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid magic numbers with no clear cause-effect relationship.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;literal values without explanation can be difficult to understand because the programmer has to interpret whether a particular value is significant or just an arbitrary placeholder to trace behaviour (e.g. should be doubled and passed on to a peer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allocate literal values to variables and constants with names that describe their function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove duplication at the point of use
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change tests’ emphasis to what behaviour expected, rather than how the test is implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extract some of the behaviour into builder objects and end up with a declarative description of what the feature does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we’re nudging the test code towards the sort of language we could use when discussing the feature with someone else, even someone non-technical.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we push everything else into supporting code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;describe the intention of a feature, not just a sequence of steps to drive it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;using these techniques, we can use higher-level tests to communicate directly with non-technical stakeholders, such as business analysts. We can use the tests to help us narrow down exactly what a feature should do and why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other tools are designed to foster collaboration across the technical and non-technical members of a team, such as FIT, Cucumber.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid reasserting behaviour that is covered in other tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;test-diagnostics&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#test-diagnostics&quot; aria-label=&quot;test diagnostics permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;test diagnostics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design to fail informatively: the point of a test is not to pass but to fail. If a failing test clearly explains what has failed and why we can quickly diagnose and correct the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we want to avoid situations when we can’t diagnose a test failure that has happened. The last thing we should have to do is crack open the debugger and step through the tested code to find the point of disagreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not too inhibited about dropping code and trying again. Sometimes, it’s quicker to roll back and restart with a clear head than to keep digging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the test is small, focused and has readable names, it should tell us most of what we need to know about what has gone wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explanatory assertion messages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the failure message should describe the cause rather than the symptom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highlight details with matchers. In addition, the matcher API includes support for describing the mismatched value to help with understanding precisely what is different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-describing value: build the detail into values in the assertion. If we add detail to an assertion, maybe that’s a hint that we could make the failure more obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;expected: &amp;lt;a customer account id&gt; but was &amp;lt;id not set&gt;
use new Date(timeValue) {public String toString() {return name; })
expected: &amp;lt;startDate&gt;, got &amp;lt;endDate&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obvious canned value
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conventions for common values can ensure that it stands out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tracer object
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dummy object that has no supported behaviour of its own, except to describe its role when something fails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jmock can accept a name when creating a mock object that will be used in failure reporting. However, where there’s more than one mock object of the same type, jMock insists that they are named to avoid confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explicitly assert that the expectation was satisfied.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A test with both expectations and assertions can produce a confusing failure. For example, this would create a failure report that says an incorrect calculation result rather than the missing collaboration that caused it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s essential to watch the test fails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it might be worth calling the assertIsSatisfied before any test assertions to get the right failure report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diagnostics are a first-class feature: try to follow four steps TDD cycle (fail, report (make the diagnostics clear), pass, refactor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the test is structured in terms of how other parts of the system represent the value, then it has a dependency on those parts and will break when they change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, mock the collaborator to return null if there’s no customer found.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first, we need to remember what’s null means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better, we could represent null with Maybe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if, instead, we’d given the tests their representation of “no customer found” as a single well-named constant instead of the literal null.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests should be written in terms of the information passed between objects, not of how that information is represented.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will make the tests more self-explanatory and shield them from changes in implementation controlled elsewhere in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus the assertions on just what’s relevant to the scenario being tested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid asserting values that aren’t driven by the test inputs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid reasserting the behaviour that is covered in other tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing for equality doesn’t scale well as the returned value becomes more complex. At the same time, comparing the total result each time is misleading and introduces an implicit dependency on the behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unit tests give us confidence that an object performs its synchronization responsibilities, such as locking its state or blocking and walking threads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coarser-grained tests, such as system tests, give us confidence that the entire system manages concurrency correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limitations of unit stress tests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is challenging to diagnose race conditions with a debugger, as stepping through code (or even adding print statements) will alter the thread scheduling causing the clash.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there may be scheduling differences between different os and processor combinations. Further, there may be other processes on a host that affect scheduling while the tests are running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run unit tests to check that our objects correctly synchronize concurrent threads and pinpoint synchronization failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run end-to-end tests to check that unit-level synchronization policies integrate across the entire system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We could also run static analysis tools as part of our automated build process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auction search is complicated because it needs to implement the search and notification functionality and the synchronization at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we want to separate the logic that splits a request into multiple tasks from the technical details of how those tasks are executed concurrently. So we pass a “task runner” into the AuctionSearch, which can then delegate managing tasks to the runner instead of starting threads itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concurrency is a system-wide concern that should be controlled outside the objects that need concurrent tasks.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the application can now easily adapt the object to the application’s threading policy without changing its implementation (“context independence” design principle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to run the tasks in the same thread as the test runner for testing instead of creating new task threads.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design stress test regard to aspects of an object’s observable behaviour that are independent of the number of threads calling into the object (observable invariants concerning concurrency)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write a stress test for the invariant that exercises the object multiple times from multiple threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch the test fail, and tune the stress test until it reliably fails on every test run; and,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make test the test pass by adding synchronization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, one invariant of our auctionSearch is that it notifies the consumer just once the search has finished, no matter how many Auction houses it searches or how many threads it starts.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stress testing passive objects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most objects don’t start threads themselves but have multiple threads “pass-through” them and alter their state. In such cases, an object must synchronize access to any state that might cause a race condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to stress-test the synchronization of a passive object, the test must start its threads to call the object. When all the threads have finished, the object’s state should be the same as if those calls had happened in sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synchronizing test thread with background threads
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid sleep/delay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use jMock’s Synchroniser for synchronizing between test and background threads, based on whether a state machine has entered or left a given state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;synchroniser&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;waitUtil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;searching&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;finished&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in an asynchronous test, the control returns to the test before the tested activity is complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An asynchronous test must wait for success and use timeouts to detect failure.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this implies every tested activity must have an observable effect: a test must affect the system so that its observable state becomes different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are two ways a test can observe the system: by sampling its observable state or listening for events that it sends out.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for example, auction sniper end-to-end tests sample the user interface for display changes through the window licker framework but listen for chat events in the fake auction server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make asynchronous tests detect success as quickly as possible to provide rapid feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put the timeout values in one place
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s a balance to be struck between a timeout that’s too short, which will make the tests unreliable, and one that’s too long, which will make failing tests too slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the timeout duration is defined in one place, it’s easy to find and change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scattering Adhoc sleeps and timeouts throughout the tests makes them challenging to understand because it leaves too much implementation detail in the tests themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capturing notifications
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an event-based assertion waits for an event by blocking a monitor until it gets notified or times out. When the monitor is notified, the test thread wakes up and finds that the scheduled event has arrived or is blocked again. If the test times out, then it raises a failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;polling for changes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sample-based assertion repeatedly samples some visible effect of the system through a “probe,” waiting for the probe to detect that the system has entered an expected state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are two aspects to the process of sampling: polling the system and failure reporting and probing the system for a given state.

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing that an action has no effect
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if an asynchronous test waits for something not to happen, it cannot even be sure that the system has started before it checks the result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the test should trigger behaviour that is detectable and use that to detect that the system has stabilized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the skill here is in picking behaviour that will not interfere with the test’s assertions and will complete after the tested behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distinguish synchronizations and assertions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adopt a naming scheme to distinguish between synchronizations and assertions. For example, waitUntil() and assertEventually()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;externalize event sources
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hidden timers are complicated to work with because they make it hard to tell when the system is in a stable state for a test to make its assertions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only solution is to make the system deterministic by decoupling it from its scheduling.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can pull event generation out into a shared service-driven externally.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e., the system’s scheduler as a web service. System components schedule activities by making HTTP requests to the scheduler, triggering actions by making HTTP “postbacks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e., the scheduler published notifications onto a message bus topic that the components listened to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usually, introducing such an event infrastructure turns out to be useful for monitoring and administration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the trade-off is that our tests no longer exercise the entire system. We could also write a few slow tests, running in a separate build, that combine the whole design, including the real scheduler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contains several factory methods that create objects for use in tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mother object makes the test more readable by packaging up the code that creates new object structures and gives it a name.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most often used for values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the builder has “chainable” public methods for overwriting the values in its fields and, by convention, a build() method that is called last to create a new instance of the target object from the field values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests that need particular values within an object can specify just those values that are relevant and use defaults for the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep tests expressive and resilient to change
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wrap up most of the syntax noise when creating new objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the default case simple, and special cases not much more complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it protects the test against the changes in the structure of its object (like adding a new argument to the constructor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it helps easier to spot the errors because each builder method identifies the purpose of its parameter. (like new AddressBuilder().withStreet2(), make it obvious that street2 is passed in)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create similar objects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can initialize a single builder with the common state and then, for each object to be built, define the differing values and call its build() method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combining builders
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasizes the important information, what is being built, rather than the mechanics of building it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passing around the builders can remove much of the noise of calling build method.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anOrder().fromCustomer(aCustomer().withAddress(anAddress().withNoPostcode()))).build()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support logging: the messages are intended to be tracked by support staff and perhaps system administrators and operators to diagnose a failure or monitor the progress of the running system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diagnostic logging (debug and trace) is infrastructure for programmers. These messages should not be turned on in production because they’re intended to help the programmers understand what’s happening inside the system they’re developing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;domain probe: enables us to add observability to the domain logic while still talking in the language of the domain
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this.instrumentation.addingProductToCart({productId})&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support.notifyFiltering(tracker, location, filter);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we’re writing code in terms of our intent (helping the support people, instrumentation) rather than implementation (logging), so it’s more expressive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s easiest to test code that doesn’t depend on Infrastructure (external systems such as databases, file systems, and services). However, a typical layered architecture puts infrastructure at the bottom of the dependency chain: Application/UI -&gt; Logic -&gt; infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, structure your application so that Infrastructure and Logic are peers under the application layer, with no dependencies between Infrastructure and Logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;infrastructure &amp;#x3C;- application/UI -&gt; logic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logic sandwich
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The infrastructure and logic layers can’t communicate with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;infrastructure.writeData(logic.processInput(infrastructure.readData()))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;traffic cop
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use observer pattern to send events from infrastructure to the application layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful not to let your traffic cop turn into a god class.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving some logic code into the infrastructure layer can simplify the overall design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;splitting the application layer into multiple classes, each with its own Logic Sandwich  or simple traffic cop, can help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when logic code has infrastructure dependencies. The code will be difficult to test or resist refactoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refactor problem code into a miniature A-Frame architecture. Start at the lowest levels of your logic layer and choose a single method that depends on one clearly-defined piece of infrastructure.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the infrastructure code is intertwingled with the Logic code, dis-intertwingled it by factoring out an infrastructure wrapper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The method will act similarly to an application layer class: it will have a mix of logic and calls to infrastructure. Make this code easier to refactor by rewriting its tests to use Nullable Infrastructure dependencies instead of mocks. Then factor all the logic code into methods with no infrastructure dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, your original method will have nothing left but a small “Logic Sandwich: a call or 2 to the infrastructure class and a call to the new logic method. Now eliminate the original method by inlining it to its callers’. This will cause the logic sandwich to climb one step up your dependency chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At that point, review its design and refactor as desired to better fit the “Logic Patterns” and your application’s needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climbing the ladder takes a lot of time and effort, so do it gradually, as part of your regular work, rather than all at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus your efforts on code where testing without mocks will have noticeable benefits. Don’t waste time refactoring code that’s already easy to maintain, regardless of whether it uses mocks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logic layer computation can only be tested if the computation results are visible to tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefer pure functions where possible. Pure functions’ return values are determined only by their input parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where pure functions aren’t possible, choose immutable objects. The state of immutable objects is determined when the object is constructed and never changes afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid writing code that explicitly depends on (or changes) the state of dependencies more than one level deep. Instead, design dependencies, so they encapsulate entirely their next-level-down dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;avoid getter/setter for objects, move any behaviour that uses getter/setter into the objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd party code doesn’t always have easily visible behaviour. It also introduces breaking API changes with new releases or simply stops being maintained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrap third-party code in the code that you control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the wrapper’s API to match the needs of your application, not the third-party code, and add methods as needed to provide easily visible behaviour. &lt;strong&gt;This typically involves writing query methods to expose deeply-buries state in terms of the domain that your application needs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the third-party code introduces a breaking change, or needs to be replaced, modify the wrapper, so no other code is affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frameworks and libraries with sprawling API(s) are more difficult to wrap, so prefer libraries that have a narrowly-defined purpose and a simple API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the third-party code interfaces with an external system, use an &lt;a href=&quot;#infrastructure-wrappers&quot;&gt;Infrastructure Wrapper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for each external system - service, database, file system, or even environment variables, create one wrapper class responsible for interfacing with that system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design your wrappers to provide a crisp, clean view of the messy outside world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design your infrastructure classes to stand alone in whatever format is most beneficial to the Logic and Application layers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test your external communication against a production-like environment. For file system code, check that it reads and writes actual files. For databases and services, access an entire database or service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run your focused integration tests against test systems that are reserved exclusively for one machine’s use. It’s best to run locally on your development machine and start and stopped your test or build script. If you share test systems with other developers, you’ll experience unpredictable test failures when multiple people run the test simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a spy server when you can’t integrate it into the external system.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some high-level infrastructure classes depend on low-level infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For tests that check if external communication is done correctly, use a focused integration test (and possibly a spy server).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For parsing and processing, use more direct and faster nullable infrastructure dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;external systems are unreliable. The only sure thing is their eventual failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test that every failure case either logs an error or sends an alert. Also, test for the requests that hang too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever possible, use &lt;a href=&quot;#testable-libraries&quot;&gt;testable libraries/adapters&lt;/a&gt; rather than external services&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;overlapping sociable tests could instantiate a web of dependencies that take too long or cause - side effects. The tests could be slow, difficult to set up or fail unpredictably&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t do significant work in the constructor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t connect to external systems, start services, or perform long calculations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For code that needs to connect to an external system or start a service, provide a connect or start() method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the need to perform a long calculation, consider lazy initialization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ensures that all logic classes can be constructed without providing any parameters (without using a DI framework).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In practice, this means that most objects instantiate their dependencies in their constructor by default, although they may also accept them as optional parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If parameterless constructor won’t make any sense, provide a test-only factory method. The factory method should provide overridable defaults for mandatory parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factory method is easiest to maintain if it’s located next to the actual constructors in the production code. It should be marked as test-specific and straightforward enough to not need tests of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call dependencies’ methods to help define test expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, if you’re testing an InventoryReport that includes an address in its header, don’t hardcode “123 Main St.” as your expectation for the report header test. Instead, call Address. renderAsOneLine() as part of defining your test expectation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collaborator-based isolation allows you to change features without modifying a lot of tests.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;used to provide nullable infrastructure for tests and avoid duplicating the null checks all over the place&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stub out the third-party library that performs external communication rather than changing your infrastructure code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the stub in the same file as your infrastructure code, so it’s easy to remember and update when your infrastructure code changes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;to avoid changing method signatures when you refactor the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, encapsulate the methods with proxy or factory methods. Then, program the proxies and factories, so their parameters are all optional.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;application and high-level infrastructure code use their infrastructure dependencies to send data to external systems. They need a way of checking that the data was sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For infrastructure methods that send data and provide a way to observe that data was sent, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/domain-oriented-observability.html#DomainProbesEnableCleanerMore-focusedTests&quot;&gt;domain-oriented observability&lt;/a&gt;. Prefer using observer patterns like &lt;a href=&quot;#send-events&quot;&gt;Send Events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need more than one send result or can’t store the transmitted data, use &lt;a href=&quot;#send-events&quot;&gt;“Send Events”&lt;/a&gt; To test code that uses infrastructure to get data, use Configurable Responses. To test code that responds to infrastructure events uses “Behavior Simulation.”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;send-events&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#send-events&quot; aria-label=&quot;send events permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Send Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you test code that uses infrastructure dependencies to send large blobs of data or sends data multiple times in a row. &lt;a href=&quot;#send-state&quot;&gt;“Send State”&lt;/a&gt; will consume too much memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an observer pattern to emit an event when your infrastructure code sends data. Include data as part of the event payload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When tests need to assert the sent data, they can listen for the events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a helper function that listens for sent events and stores their data in an array to make your tests easier to read.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some external systems will push data to you rather than waiting for you to ask for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, your application and high-level infrastructure code need a way to test what happens when their infrastructure dependencies generate those events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add methods to your infrastructure code that simulate receiving an event from an external system. Share as much code as possible with the code that handles actual external events while remaining convenient for tests to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“make asynchronous tests detect success as quickly as possible so that they provide rapid feedback”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“test doubles are fine, but don’t stop there if you can invert the dependency and turn expectations into stubs… or even better, replace the stub with the value it returns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading/learning can be a “priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn for better understanding of others and myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to make fewer mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to increase knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to find meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn improves vocabulary, focus, memory and imagination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odds are that no matter what you’re working on, someone somewhere, who is smarter than you, has probably thought about your problem and put it into a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are few things that hold us back and rob us our productivity, prosperity, positivity and peace of mind and reduce our capacity to think, focus, learn, grow, and be fully human
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drowning in data and rapid change, we long for strategies and tools to regain some semblance of productivity, performance, and peace of mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fleeting ping of digital dopamine pleasure replaces our ability to sustain the attention necessary for deep relationships, deep learning or deep work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overuse of digital technology results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities. Short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from underuse if we overuse technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we’re letting technology do much of our critical thinking and reasoning for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing the work required to hold on opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“what an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected business. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m no genius, I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“any fool can know. The point is to understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it takes one to know one”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True experts recognize the limits of what they know what what they do not know. If they find themselves outside of their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Skim a lot of books, read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding is a two way operation; the learner has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has to be willing to argue with the teacher, once he understands what the teacher is saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“go to bed smarter than when you woke up”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when it comes to reading, you don’t need to finish what you start”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pencil,” he argues, “becomes the sign of your alertness while you read”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“first you make your habits and then your habits make you”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“anything is good for your heart is good for you head”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifelong learning adds years to your life and life to your years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEAM: Together Everyone Achieve More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be kind to yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning is not solo, it’s social&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;genius leaves clues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no failure, only failure to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practice makes progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to understand is to know what to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the key to better comprehension is asking better questions”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you shall receive when you ask questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading/learning can be a “priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn for better understanding of others and myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to make fewer mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to increase knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to find meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn improves vocabulary, focus, memory and imagination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odds are that no matter what you’re working on, someone somewhere, who is smarter than you, has probably thought about your problem and put it into a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are few things that hold us back and rob us our productivity, prosperity, positivity and peace of mind and reduce our capacity to think, focus, learn, grow, and be fully human
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drowning in data and rapid change, we long for strategies and tools to regain some semblance of productivity, performance, and peace of mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fleeting ping of digital dopamine pleasure replaces our ability to sustain the attention necessary for deep relationships, deep learning or deep work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overuse of digital technology results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities. Short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from underuse if we overuse technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we’re letting technology do much of our critical thinking and reasoning for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/two-types-of-knowledge/&quot;&gt;two types of knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first type of knowledge is real, it can’t be bought. It can’t be copied. If you want real knowledge you need to earn it. The second type of knowledge is copied. On the surface you know the answer but you lack the understanding to show your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;real knowledge comes from ability to explain things without using jargon or vague terms, understand how things interact and predict the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;distinguish between people who’ve done the work and those who haven’t. The ones who have will pass the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/batesian-mimicry/&quot;&gt;Batesian Mimicry Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 stages of learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unconscious incompetence:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don’t know what you don’t know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you might not even be aware of the fact that something like speed-reading exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you’re also not aware that you’re currently not capable of doing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conscious incompetence:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you know what you don’t know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you’re aware that people have learned to read and comprehend much faster through speed-reading techniques, but you yourself have not had any training in this area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conscious competence:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you’re aware of a skill and have the capacity to perform that skill, but it requires your conscious attention to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unconscious competence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you know how to perform a skill, and it’s second nature to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with speed reading, you would reach the point of unconscious competence when this simply becomes the way you read, without deliberate attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;true mastery
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s second nature to perform a skill at an elite level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m either good at something or I’m not -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I can improve my skills with effort and practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when people give me feedback, it feels like criticism -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I appreciate when people give me feedback ,it helps me learn and grow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m just not good at math -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Math is challenging for me, but I know I can improve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m too shy to speak in front of the class -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;With practice, I can become more confident and improve my public speaking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m already a really good writer. I don’t need to get any better -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;There’s always room for improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who are naturally smart don’t need to try hard to succeed -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No one is born smart. We can all improve with time, effort and persistence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other people’s successes make me feed bad about myself -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Other people’s successes encourage and inspire me. They show me what is possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful people are lucky/talented and have never experienced failure -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Failure is part of success. Most successful people have failed many times, but they succeeded because they didn’t quit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I was as good at baseball as you, it’s not fair -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Your skills as a baseball player inspire me. Do you have any tips to help me improve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s embarrassing when I make a mistake -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;everyone makes mistakes and mistakes are opportunities to learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I don’t try new or hard things, then I won’t fail -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I have to try new and difficult things in order to grow, even if I fail at first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I fail, I get frustrated and give up -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When I fail or get frustrated, I try again using the lessons I’ve learned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure means it is time to give up -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I only truly fail when I stop trying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t do that -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I can’t do that yet, I’m going to keep going, try new strategies, and/or ask for help until I understand it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I don’t improve right away, I get frustrated. I start to criticize myself -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I know improvement takes time and I celebrate the small steps. Even a little progress makes a difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the purpose one has for taking action. The energy required for someone to behave in a particular way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motivation = Purpose x Energy x Small Simple Steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how connected do I feel to my purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how are my day-to-day energy levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what am I allowing to drain my energy that I no longer should?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware of how you’re holding yourself back to limiting beliefs, deeply held beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions we create about who we are, how the world works, what we’re capable of and deserve, and what is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;none of these are preinstalled at birth, which means you pick them up from your environment and those around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any limitations are self-imposed and that your true potential is within your control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be truly present in any situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intelligence is fixed -&gt; your intelligence is not only malleable but dependent on your ability to cultivate a growth mindset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we only use 10% of our brains -&gt; I’m learning to use my whole brain in the best way possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mistakes are failures -&gt; there’s no such thing as failure. Only failure to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knowledge is power -&gt; knowledge + action = power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning new things is very difficult -&gt; when you learn new ways how to learn, the challenge of learning new things can be fun, easier, and more enjoyable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;criticism of other people matters -&gt; it’s not your job to like, love or respect me. It’s mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;genius is born -&gt; genius is not born, it’s made through deep practice.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small simple steps repeated lead to habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating habits to automate essential parts of our lives is a fundamental streamlining technique that we do largely unconsciously, often to our benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calm the busy minds with meditation, yoga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breathing with 4-7-8 method
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hold your breath for a count of 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exhale completely through your mouth, making a shoosh sound to a count of 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do something that has been causing you stress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schedule time for distraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a specific process for accomplishing something, especially an orderly, logical or systematic way of instruction
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frequently challenge your methods by asking yourself the following questions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have I thought about methods I’m using?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have I learned this method from someone successful at what I’m trying to achieve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if I changed my method, would my results look different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F - Forget&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to forget what you know about the subject, forget situational things that are not urgent, and temporarily forget your limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with a beginner’s mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;employ ACTIVE recall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimal learning occurred when an initial learning session included repeated study and forced-recall testing of all items at least 4 times in a row&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning is not a spectator sport. Practice, take notes or ask questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your superbrain works not by consuming information, but by creating and co-creating it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 quadrants of active learning
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visualization: a picture worth thousands word, same is true for learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;association: associate it with something you already know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotion: emotion + association = long-term memory
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding emotion to association registers your new information in long-term memory. Regardless of emotion you use, emotion makes retention much more robust and durable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;location: associate things to a place you’re familiar most&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T - Teach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you teach something to someone, you get to learn it twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn with the intention of teaching somebody specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feynman technique
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organize and simplify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transmit (optional)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey it to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attempt to transmit the material to at least 1 person who isn’t that familiar with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S - State&lt;/strong&gt;. All learning is state dependant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be fully present and don’t focus on other things that are not urgent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changing your physiology, changes your psychology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as your body moves, your brain grooves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re feeling great, the greater results you will produce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stand up if you can’t sit up tight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facilitates breathing and improves circulation of oxygen to your brain and the rest of your body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;employ space repetition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by spacing the intervals out, you’re exercising neural connections each time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spaced repetition produces long-term and robust retention of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spaced repetition works best when you review material at similar intervals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;review things that you want to understand better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice what you learned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;use your sense of smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;smells bring memories to the forefront of our brains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the scent of rosemary has been shown to improve memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peppermint and lemon promote concentration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-taking&quot;&gt;note taking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;music for the mind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;music stabilizes mental, and emotional rhythms to attain a state of deep concentration and focus in which large amounts of content information can be processed and learned”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;baroque music stands out in particular, although one’s reaction to music is deeply personal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;listen with your whole brain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remember acronym HEAR - halt, empathy, anticipate, review
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be attentive, be interested, be alert and not distracted, create a positive atmosphere through non-verbal behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be a sounding board - allow the speaker to bounce ideas and feelings off you while assuming a non-judgmental, non-critical manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t interrogate, don’t ask a lot of questions, they can give the impression you’re grilling the speaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;act like a mirror, reflect back what you think the speaker is saying and feeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t discount the speaker’s feelings by using stock phrases like “it’s not that bad,” or “you will feel better tomorrow”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t let the speaker hook you. This can happen if you get angry or upset, allow yourself to get involved in an argument, or pass judgment on the other person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;indicate you’re listening by
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;providing brief, noncommittal acknowledging responses, e.g., “Uh-huh,”, “I see”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giving nonverbal acknowledgements, e.g., head nodding, facial expressions matching the speaker, open and relaxed body expression, eye contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invitations to say more, e.g., “tell me about it,” “I’ d like to hear more about that”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do reflect back to the speaker what you understand and how you think the speaker feels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t change subject or move in a new direction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t rehearse in your own head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t teach or give advice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 morning habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remember your dreams, make your bed, hydrate, brush your teeth with the opposite hand, deep breathing exercises, brain tea, journaling, HIT workout (high intensity interval training), brain power smoothie, read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first 60 minutes can either set you up for maximum productivity and bring you closer to your long-term and short-term goals or cause you to lose another day to distractions and mental fog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;combining audio listening with other activities such as washing dishes, driving, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use playback speed at 1.5, 1.7 to skim through materials to get the key ideas before spending more time in reading the book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark up the book while reading it. Questions, thoughts. And, more important connections to other ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the end of each chapter, without looking back, write some notes on the main points/arguments/take-away. Then look back through the chapter and write down anything you missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specifically note anything that was in the chapter that you can apply somewhere else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;summary and review the notes periodically&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;link things you want to remember in the chain (hydrant) and a second one (balloon) and then you tie them together using an action, the most exaggerated, unique, funny, emotional, possible. emotion + visualization + action + exaggeration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;balloons&lt;/code&gt; tied to the red vivid &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fire hydrant&lt;/code&gt;. The balloons seemingly come from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;barrel&lt;/code&gt;. Inside the barrel, there is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;board&lt;/code&gt; that closely resembles the shape of a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;diamond&lt;/code&gt;. The diamond drops on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Sir lancelot&lt;/code&gt; head. He is then rushed to emergency in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mask&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mask&lt;/code&gt; as it turns out is dirty that it needs to be cleaned with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;toothpaste&lt;/code&gt;. The leftover toothpaste is thrown away and now stuck at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sign&lt;/code&gt; outside the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the sun list, we now have 20 pegs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;associate the item with the Sun List.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to create a strong memorable association, we need to use a vivid imagination. We should create an image in our head that is illogical, funny, or cool to make it memorable
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to remember #9 is people, we could image cat people. That’s weird, and funny so it’s memorable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;create 10 landmarks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select 2 rooms in your home and create 5 landmarks in each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;imagine you are standing in the doorway and go clockwise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick places, not empty space - so don’t pick a corner of the room; pick something in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick things that are relatively large - so pick the coffee table, not the figures in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick only one of each item per room, if you have 4 chairs, use one chair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you need to create more than 10 landmarks, use other rooms. You can also use your office, your car, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pair each key point to a landmark
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create an image for each key point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put each key point into its corresponding place&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;exercise: keep practicing until you become very good at it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;say: say the person’s name back right after you heard it, that way you’d have heard the name twice&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you have ANT(s), automatic negative talk, your brain releases chemicals that make you feel bad. Moreover, your memory, learning and judgment are affected negatively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify what strain of ANT you have (mind-reading, blame, labeling, guilt, or fortune-telling) and then challenge it by talking back to it, which you can do with positive affirmations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with the ABRA technique, you acknowledge, breathe in, release, and align
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A - acknowledge ANT because what you resist persist.So acknowledging the ANT helps you to avoid having to continuously fight it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B - deep breathing helps you relax and focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R - releasing the thought helps you to release it out of your body before you spend time comtemplating it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A - align yourself back to the truth about who you are. Saying the opposite of the negative thought, which is simply a positive affirmation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a more analytical technique from Dr. Daniel Ame requires you to ask some questions, it involves a few steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself if the ANT is true&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself if it’s possible eto absolutely know that it’s true&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself how you react when you think that thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself who you would be if you didn’t have that thought, how would you feel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the opposite of that ANT? What is a positive affirmation you can use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contemplating your ANT(s) like this can help you see they are not truths but thoughts made up of fears, worries, or criticism. And, ending with the positive affirmation can help you move towards better thoughts and beliefs that help you have more happiness.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diets
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eat good brain food like blueberries, avocado, broccoli, coconut oil, eggs, green leafy vegetables, salmon and sardines, turmeric, walnut, dark chocolate.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;high-quality foods that contain lots of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants nourishes the brain and protects it from oxidative stress, the waste produced when the body use oxygen, which can damage cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#kill-your-negative-self-talk--ants&quot;&gt;avoid negative thoughts and complaining&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exercise regularly
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when your body moves, your brain grooves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exercise changes the brain in ways that protect memory and thinking skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get your brain nutrient
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take a blood test and verify your deficiencies. Then take the appropriate supplements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep a positive peer group
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who you spend time with is who you become. People who encourage you and hold you to the  higher standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;join community online (facebook, etc…) to support you with your interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain a clean environment
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meaning clean air, water and space around you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get good sleep
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dreaming is essential for fantastic ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clear your brain of plaque that leads to dementia and Alzheimer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sleep is vital for protecting you against age-related brain damage, and it is crucial for day-to-day functioning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protect your brain
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid putting your phone under your pillow and protect yourself from head injuries by wearing a helmet when cycling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn new things
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neuroplasticity (connections in your brain) can be instigated through learning new things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce your stress through yoga, meditation, or massages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing the work required to hold on opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“what an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected business. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m no genius, I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“any fool can know. The point is to understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it takes one to know one”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True experts recognize the limits of what they know what what they do not know. If they find themselves outside of their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skim a lot of books, read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding is a two way operation; the learner has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has to be willing to argue with the teacher, once he understands what the teacher is saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“go to bed smarter than when you woke up”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pencil,” he argues, “becomes the sign of your alertness while you read”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first you make your habits and then your habits make you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anything is good for your heart is good for you head&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifelong learning adds years to your life and life to your years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEAM: Together Everyone Achieve More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be kind to yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning is not solo, it’s social&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;genius leaves clues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no failure, only failure to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practice makes progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to understand is to know what to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the key to better comprehension is asking better questions”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you shall receive when you ask questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing the work required to hold on opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“what an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected business. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m no genius, I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“any fool can know. The point is to understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it takes one to know one”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True experts recognize the limits of what they know what what they do not know. If they find themselves outside of their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Skim a lot of books, read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding is a two way operation; the learner has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has to be willing to argue with the teacher, once he understands what the teacher is saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“go to bed smarter than when you woke up”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when it comes to reading, you don’t need to finish what you start”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pencil,” he argues, “becomes the sign of your alertness while you read”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“first you make your habits and then your habits make you”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“anything is good for your heart is good for you head”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifelong learning adds years to your life and life to your years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEAM: Together Everyone Achieve More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be kind to yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning is not solo, it’s social&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;genius leaves clues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no failure, only failure to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practice makes progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to understand is to know what to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the key to better comprehension is asking better questions”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you shall receive when you ask questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/circle-of-competence/&quot;&gt;circle of competence&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each of us, through experience or study, has built up useful knowledge on certain areas of the world. Some areas are understood by most of us, while some areas require a lot more specialty to evaluate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that basic knowledge, along with some understanding of accounting and a little bit of study, would enable one to evaluate and invest in any number of restaurants and restaurant chains, public or private.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where should we devote our limited time in life, to achieve the most success? define the perimeter of your circle of competence, and operate inside. Over time, work to expand that circle but never fool yourself about where it stands today, and never be afraid to say “I don’t know”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you know when to follow the rules and when they’ll get you in trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to do the reading, you have to talk to competent people and understand their arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to think about key variables and how they interact over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to listen and chase down arguments that run counter to your views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to think about how you might be fooling yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to see the issue from multiple perspectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need to become your most intelligent critic and have the intellectual honesty to kill some of your best-loved ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doing the work counteracts our natural desire to seek out only information that confirms that we believe we know.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;most of your results are going to come from just a small percentage of your effort or work.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of relationships lead to 80% happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% exercises lead to 80% of health benefit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of items on your todo list lead to 80% of productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of foods you eat cause 80% of your sickness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by taking 10 minutes per day for prioritization, you can double your productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by looking at what experiences give you the most delight, you can begin to engineer your life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reverse-engineer complicated situations and unleash creative possibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reasoning from first principles, it’s a tool to help clarify complicated problems by separating the underlying ideas or facts from any assumptions based on them. what remains are essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you know the first principles of something, you can build the rest of your knowledge around them to produce something new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s one of the best ways to learn to think for yourself, unlock your creative potential, and move from linear to non-linear results.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;socratic questioning
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (why do I think this? what exactly do I think?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;challenging assumptions (how do I know this is true? what if I thought the opposite?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looking for evidence (how can I back this up? what are the sources?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;considering alternative perspectives (what might others think? how do I know I’m correct?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;examining consequences and implications (what if I am wrong? what are the consequences if I am?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;questioning the original questions (why did I think that? was I correct? what conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the process stops you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses. This process helps you build something that lasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;five why?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asking why with the hope to get closer to the truth that we try to understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing the work required to hold on opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“what an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected business. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m no genius, I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“any fool can know. The point is to understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it takes one to know one”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True experts recognize the limits of what they know what what they do not know. If they find themselves outside of their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Skim a lot of books, read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding is a two way operation; the learner has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has to be willing to argue with the teacher, once he understands what the teacher is saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“go to bed smarter than when you woke up”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when it comes to reading, you don’t need to finish what you start”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pencil,” he argues, “becomes the sign of your alertness while you read”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“first you make your habits and then your habits make you”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“anything is good for your heart is good for you head”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifelong learning adds years to your life and life to your years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEAM: Together Everyone Achieve More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be kind to yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning is not solo, it’s social&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;genius leaves clues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no failure, only failure to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practice makes progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to understand is to know what to do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when people return to their desk, will they be able to apply what they’ve learnt in a useful way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a fair idea who will come and what’s the production code and tests look like at present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discuss with attendee what they’re interested in learning and what they are currently struggling with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bloom’s taxonomy, thinking skills can be described in terms of six broad categories
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, creating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help you plan exercises and teaching materials at an appropriate level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with materials to build remembering, understanding and applying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when those thinking skills are in place, you can do more analyzing, evaluating and creating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a long lists of good &lt;strong&gt;verbs&lt;/strong&gt; to describe thinking skills in each category. These words are useful as a prompt or start of a sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each person who comes to your learning hour has a unique background, and what they’re going to learn needs to be integrated with what they already know for it to stick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4C’s:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connect: get people in the right head-space for learning about the topic together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concept: introduce the new skills or ideas or information you want the participants to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concrete: hands-on exercises to practice skills or figure out how things work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conclusions: an opportunity for people to consolidate and internalize what they’ve learnt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you want to help people to be present mentally, fuel their curiosity, let them work out what they need to do, and to come to their own understanding of the topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;useful rules about how the brain works
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;movement trump sitting&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you want people to move out of a sitting position at least every 10-15 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arrange the chairs so people physically stand up and move a chair to the right every time you change typist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you gather observations in retrospective, people can each walk up to the whiteboard and stick their notes onto it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when reviewing code, you can stick printouts to the walls and have people move around to look at them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re working together remotely, get people to take breaks and leave their desks from time to time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;talking trumps listening&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you talk about what you just heard it reinforces your memory of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talking also gives opportunities for feedback from others about how well you seem to understand the topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask people to pair up to discuss a topic or share experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;images trumps words&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the picture and associated story evokes an emotion, it would make it easier to pay attention and recall it later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term memories often comprise of images and associated emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;writing trumps reading&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you read, it’s easier for your mind to wander.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing also makes the information multi-sensory, you physically move a pen on some paper as well as see the text on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;draw lines and boxes to situate the information in space and relate it to other information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide handouts, notes and quizzes that people can annotate. Ask people to write conclusions and observations on sticky notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;shorter trumps longer&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;student’s minds tend to drift after about 10 minutes of traditional lecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to keep people’s attention, divide your presentations into 10-20 minute chunks and in between spend at least 1-2 minutes on some other activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perhaps ask people to review or discuss the material presented so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break off occasionally for Q&amp;#x26;A, or to ask people to note down what they observed so far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;different trumps same&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anything new or unexpected will catch people’s attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;games and simulations an exercises can contain built-in surprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suddenly change requirement mid-exercise. Keep it fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One example learning objectives
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe some characteristics of approval testing -&gt; remembering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compare approval testing with assertion-based testing -&gt; understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the approvals framework to write test cases -&gt; applying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;deliberate-practice&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#deliberate-practice&quot; aria-label=&quot;deliberate practice permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deliberate practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in order to use red-green-refactor cycle competently, you need to
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify the next test case that will incrementally improve your solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design the specifics of that test case and see it fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement a solution design which is testable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refactor to improve your design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re weak in any one of those component skills, you will struggle to do TDD.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the great advantage of practice exercises is we can find ones that let us work on those component skills individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a teacher, I want to plan a series of learning hours that will be at just hte right level so people don’t get bored and don’t get overwhelmed or frustrated.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;think about what we did today. If you had to explain the main idea of TDD to someone else, what would you say?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write your explanation in a sentence or two on a post-it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put up a flipchart with the question “what is the main idea of TDD?” Ask people to stick their post-it notes on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read some notes out to the group before you partway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hang the poster somewhere prominent afterwards, perhaps in the team area or coffee room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if working remotely, they can each write their sentence or two in a shared online document.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;XP teams are very code-centric and focused on making functional software. When reflection and learning happen, it’s often in a watered down, haphazard way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone has to decide to make learning not just an individual experience but a collective experience. When that happens, learning isn’t just something that occurs naturally, it is something that the company uses to drive the future of business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“what is the simplest, most cost-effective way to share learnings?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a group of people who functioned together in an extraordinary way, who trusted one another, who complemented each others’ strengths and compensated for each others’ limitations, who had common goals were larger than individual goals, and who produced extraordinary results.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the team that became great didn’t start off great - it &lt;strong&gt;learned&lt;/strong&gt; how to produce extraordinary results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a programmer’s study group will meet regularly in a comfortable place to delve into important technical topics. These topics can come from group’s learning repository, from books or articles, or even from a guest participant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a simple, security-free, browser-based learning repository, such as Ward Cunningham’s Wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just install it and asking folks to use it isn’t enough. Teams need to establish usage convention
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developers will quickly jot down learnings on index cards, as they work, and when they integrate their code, they can integrate significant learnings as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;atlassian confluence provides similar functionality but how can we organize and maintain the group knowledge effectively?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.industriallogic.com/img/blog/2012/03/khdraft1.pdf&quot;&gt;a pattern language for study groups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a study group can make a difficult book easier to understand, it can succeed where an unsatisfying class fails, and it can support you if your environment doesn’t support your ongoing learning and growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once teams produce enough learning content they will need to reflect on and discuss it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are 2 good places to do this: for technical matters, the best place is a programmer’s study group; and for team, people or process maters, the best place is in an iteration retrospective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every programmer on the team needed to at least be aware of the system’s potent smells. This would enable them all to pay attention to these smells and consider how to refactor them out of existence&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look into process of documenting these potent smells (index cards, wiki, etc…). This would eventually led to direct action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recommend that groups meet for 2 hours if they want to delve deeply into a subject, though one-hour meetings are fine for covering topics quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;absolutely no one should play the role of lecturer or teacher in a study group.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the group meets to conduct group learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if someone is expert in a certain technical area, that individual ought to help others learn, not show off or talk down to participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuously learning coach
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the coach is the leader of the team. If the coach doesn’t value learning, the team won’t either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the coach must lead by example. This means that the coach will seek out and obtain coaching and mentoring from the best sources available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coaches must strive to learn about their customer’s needs, team or personality conflicts, new technologies, and the latest wisdom about XP and other lightweight methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;patterns are grouped into 4 secions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spirit

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow customs that will re-enforce the spirit of the group, piquing participant’s interest in dialogues, accomodating different learning levels, making the study of literature easier, recording group experiences, and drawing people closer together.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the continuous learning approach to retrospectives means they come not at the end of a project, but at the end of every iteration.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conducting iteration retrospectives will enable teams to quickly adjust and improve their performance, because they will be continuously revisiting these questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what worked well?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what did we learn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what should we do differently next time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what still puzzles us?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what happened?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people have a fear of retrospectives, because they have a fear of being attacked, of being made to look foolish, of getting a poor performance review or of hurting someone’s feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s detrimental to retrospectives if people are afraid, or if there is an atmosphere of blame, criticism, sarcasm, or even humor at other people’s expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills, and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s vital that the facilitator be an outsider and not a member of the team involved in the retrospective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;participants take the lessons learned during the retrospective and turn them into concrete ideas for improving their development process.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the key to retrospective is to make sure you’re solving the correct problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where can one obtain knowledge in its fullest unfiltered, unsimplified form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great literature tends to be hard to study and understand. Many people either aren’t prepared to do this hard work or simply don’t want to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;authors of great literature commonly reference, extend, or refute ideas communicated by their ancestors or peers. This can make it doubly hard to understand their writings, since one may need to understand referenced works in order to understand author’s own work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as great literature ages, people don’t believe it will contain the “modern” knowledge they need. So even if some great book written 30 years ago contains the exact knowledge they seek, people won’t find it, for they are unaware of the abundance of knowledge contained in older works of literature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the hard work put into the study of great literature is worthwhile because it ensures that people retain the knowledge they wish to obtain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great literature is much easier to understand when it is studied in an intelligent sequence &lt;a href=&quot;#sequential-study&quot;&gt;sequential study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is easier and more rewarding to study great literature with other people &lt;a href=&quot;#pool-of-insight&quot;&gt;pool of insight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discover the great literature in your profession or area of interest - the finest books, articles, and speeches ever written, and then begin an earnest study of these works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you find the great literature worthy of study? Ask people. Ask knowledgeable people which authors they like, what are their favorite books, what profoundly influenced them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after identifying the works, form or join a study group, &lt;a href=&quot;#pool-of-insight&quot;&gt;pool of insight&lt;/a&gt;, order the works to be studied &lt;a href=&quot;#sequential-study&quot;&gt;sequential study&lt;/a&gt; and compose an &lt;a href=&quot;#agenda&quot;&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pool-of-insight&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#pool-of-insight&quot; aria-label=&quot;pool of insight permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;pool of insight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once you’ve discovered your &lt;a href=&quot;#knowledge-hydrant&quot;&gt;knowledge hydrant&lt;/a&gt;, it can be overshelming to drink from it. This pattern suggests how to make the study of great literature easier and more rewarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s nothing wrong with reading and studying literature on one’s own. But great literature is worth knowing well, and individual study pales in comparison with teh study of literature in a group dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in communicating how they understand something, people may
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clarify what confused others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expose their own misunderstandings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveal new ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;articulate that which they didn’t know they knew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a dialogue, nobody is trying to win. Everybody wins if anybody wins.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whenever any mistake is discovered on the part of anybody, everybody gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a spirit present in dialogues that one doesn’t find in many other learning environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many groups sustain a group’s spirit by meeting weekly or biweekly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read and study literature on one’s own, but discuss it with others in a regular study group. Aim to ask questions about you don’t know and explain what you do know. Your exchanges with colleagues will enrich your understanding immensely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the best study groups are those in which individuals feel comfortable learning with others &lt;a href=&quot;#safe-place&quot;&gt;safe place&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some environments promote dialogues, &lt;a href=&quot;#common-ground&quot;&gt;common ground&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#public-living-room&quot;&gt;public living room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the most enriching study happens when a group has a &lt;a href=&quot;#motivated-moderator&quot;&gt;motivated moderator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#prepared-participants&quot;&gt;prepared participants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;safe-place&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#safe-place&quot; aria-label=&quot;safe place permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;safe place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a good physical environment &lt;a href=&quot;#common-ground&quot;&gt;common ground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#public-living-room&quot;&gt;public living room&lt;/a&gt; is vital for any study group. Equally vital, is the intellectual environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;loud-mouths, show-offs, know-it-alls, and people who are overly competitive, adversarial or confrontational, can make other uncomfortable or insecure, and create an environment that is not conductive to learning, sharing or the building of ideas&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when places of learning have highly critical or judgemental natures, an individual’s ability to learn can easily be compromised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;treat each other as colleagues with respect, despite differences in opinion, acknowledges the mutual risk and establishes the sense of safety in facing the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generally, as long as the people arguing are remaining civil (treat each other with kindness, consideration and respect) and as long as the argument isn’t too far off the subject being studied, it can be quite instructive for a group to listen and learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually, it is best for someone who is intimate with the group’s customs to approach the individual during a short break or &lt;a href=&quot;#after-hours&quot;&gt;after hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;establish a warm, tolerant, polite and focused environment in which individuals help each other where everyone is comfortable to ask questions and make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in practice, there will always be some level of personality conflicts or discord within a group. It can help if people get together after a session, &lt;a href=&quot;#after-hours&quot;&gt;after hours&lt;/a&gt;, to talk about the issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this pattern identifies what is needed in a study group to bring it to life, and sustain it over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s fairly easy to start a study group. But keeping it going, so that members are active, dialogues are insightful, and the group is long-lived, is another matter altogether.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a study group’s energy initially comes from its founder. If the founder is genuinely interested in creating thriving, long-lasting &lt;a href=&quot;#pool-of-insight&quot;&gt;pool of insight&lt;/a&gt;, to improve himself/herself and his community, the group will start life with a powerful energy. But if founder is merely interested in short-term gains, or personal recognition, the group will be short-lived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In considering the long-term vitality of the group, there are many decisions to make
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when will the group meet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how long will its meetings be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what will be studied?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if poor or uninformed decisions are made about these issues, a group may be never take root or be long-lived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frequent meetings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s difficult to maintain any sort of low or continuous energy. A month between meetings is usually far too long for people to maintain focus and enthusiasm. Therefore, have the group meet weekly or bi-weekly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these frequent meetings will allow a group to study effectively and may lead some members to become &lt;a href=&quot;#kindred-collaborators&quot;&gt;kindred collaborators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hour meetings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a one hour meeting is typically not enough time for a group to have an insightful dialogue on a piece of literature. But three hours is too much time, since most participants can’t actively engage in dialogue for that long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore, limit dialogues to a maximum of 2 hours, and if energy has waned significantly before that time, finish the meeting early&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short breaks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at a certain time in a dialogue, a group’s intensity focus and effectiveness will begin to diminish. If the group doesn’t take a break at this time, the quality of the dialogue may begin to deteriorate and people will become uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore, allow for a short (10 or 15 minute) break in the middle of a study group session, to let members reflect, chat, use the restrooms, and prepare for the next half of the dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid group meetings in dull, stuffy, maybe windowless, conference room since the location and space will play a huge role in sustaining a group’s energy.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;places that attract people is usually, spacious, comfortable, energetic. It helps creating bonding and bring life to the dialogues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create study groups out of genuine enthusiasm to study a subject in-depth. Meet weekly or bi-weekly for 2 hours, and have a short-break in the middle. Choose a meeting location where people will enjoy passing time, and study only those writings which are worthy of group’s attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;create &lt;a href=&quot;#subgroup&quot;&gt;subgroups&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#study-cycle&quot;&gt;study cycle&lt;/a&gt; to let people place their energy where they best see fit.

&lt;li&gt;it is a custom of some groups to go out after meetings &lt;a href=&quot;#after-hours&quot;&gt;after hours&lt;/a&gt; to partake in food and drink. This social time can go far towards sustaining relationships and adding energy back to a group…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a study group has an enduring energy, people get to know each other, a community forms, and there is a lasting possibility for collaborations and working relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so many people dislike networking. They want to grow professionally, and they think that networking can help, but they don’t know how, where and with whom to network effectively.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many people feel isolated in their jobs. So much of their time is spent working that there is little time left to pursue genuinely interests them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some try to organize study groups within their own companies, but if often fails due to lack of interest, or because many people prefer to be outside of work when they have any free time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some people go to conferences lectures, user groups and parties in the hope of advancing their careers and themselves. Often, they end up frustrated in reality, they don’t grow professionally at these meetings and their networking is ineffective. The trouble often results from what may be described as weak connections that develop between people who meet in large groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In frequently meeting study group, people get to know each other over time. They learn what they like and dislike, what they excel at and where they are weak, where they are in their careers and where they’d like to go. This level of familiarity forms the foundation for a rich network that can yield very real career and collaboration possibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As one gets to know others within a group, one can get a very good idea of who would be good for a specific projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;quality networking happens best when a study group is a &lt;a href=&quot;#safe-place&quot;&gt;safe place&lt;/a&gt; composed of diverse individuals and true peers. The best time for networking is either before study groups meets or &lt;a href=&quot;#after-hours&quot;&gt;after hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-ground&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#common-ground&quot; aria-label=&quot;common ground permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;common ground&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people lack a place where they can have regular, meaning ful dialogues with other people in a casual, social setting. Work and home don’t provide it, and many clubs or groups also don’t provide it because they meet in lifeless environments that feel like someone else’s turf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people need informal public places where they can gather, put aside the concerns of work and home, relax and talk. Germany’s beer gardens, English’s pubs, and French and Viennese cafes created this outlet in people’s lives, providing a neutral ground where all are equal and conversation is the main activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;without such places, the urban area fails to nourish the kinds of relationships and the diversity of human contact that are essence of the city. Deprived of these settings, people remain lonely within their crowds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s naturally to choose one of the company’s conference rooms as a meeting location as it is spacious quiet, filled with white boards, available after hours, and free. However, it’s not a good choice, since both employees and visitors to the company, generally don’t like to spend their free time in stuffy, stale, office environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hold public study groups where diverse individuals will all be on common ground. The best locations are easy for people to get to, but not too close to their offices or homes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once common ground has been selected, a group must find a &lt;a href=&quot;#public-living-room&quot;&gt;public living room&lt;/a&gt;, a comfortable, relaxing, dialogue-friendly place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-living-room&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#public-living-room&quot; aria-label=&quot;public living room permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;public living room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inhospitable physical locations - stale, lifeless, badly lit, and uninviting - stifle individuals and thereby hinder lively, engaging dialogues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow traffic to flow with minimum disruptions since members often arrive late, leave early, get up for snacks or use the restrooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sitting circle
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;place each sitting space in a position which is protected, not cut by paths or movements, roughly circular, made so that the room itself helps suggest the circle, not too strongly, with pats and activities around it, so that people naturally gravitate toward the chairs when they get into the mood to sit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;different chairs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps people understand that the seating preferences of diverse people differ and that a group will be most comfortable if a space is outfitted with “a variety of different chairs, some big, some small, some softer than others, some rockers, some very old, some new, with arms, without arms, some wicker, some wool, some cloth.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pool of light
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;place the lights low, and apart, to form individual pools of light which encompass chairs and tables, like bubbles to reinforce the social character of the spaces which they form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose a warm, spacious establishment where people will enjoy mingling before and after study session, where there is comfortable, rearrangable furniture, plenty of warm lighting, and a variety of foods and drinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some groups may choose to reserve space or arrange to meet at a location when it closes to the public to avoid noises at certain times of day.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we engaged and joyful (&lt;strong&gt;ALIVE&lt;/strong&gt;) here? How can I make it more so?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things that can boost aliveness: urgency and need, jokes and humor, imperfection and vulnerability, mastery and success, music and singing, games and play, anything cute, intense colors, smells, textures, tastes, friend ship, new and old, variety, change of scene, full belly, comfort, rest, hydration, safety, consent, love and romance, risk and danger, storytelling and role models, beauty, ugliness, family and community, healthy competition, laughter and competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we doing something real (&lt;strong&gt;FLUENCY&lt;/strong&gt;) here - how can we do that even more so?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fluency is defined unconscious competence, whatever you can do when there is no time to think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deliberate practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this space driving high-quality interactions and experiences (&lt;strong&gt;SETTING&lt;/strong&gt;)? How can it do that even more?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose your &lt;strong&gt;SETTING FIRST&lt;/strong&gt; to come closest to performing the skills you learn in the environment where you’ll apply them for real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we acting with clarity and confidence (&lt;strong&gt;OBVIOUS&lt;/strong&gt;)? How can we support that even more so?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;start obvious, stay obvious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning goals can be made more obvious in many ways:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk slowly and clearly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use concise, commonly understood language; avoid jargon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;illuminate the learning space sufficiently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tune into the diverse abilities and disabilities of the learners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pump up emotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use iconic illustrations, materials, and tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use familiar and favorite tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use solid, clearly defined colors and shapes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the same colors, shapes, icons, or sounds to reinforce meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus learning on physical interactions relevant to the skill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offer more practice for difficult or challenging BITE-SIZED PIECES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offer more opportunities to follow-the-leader, COPY-CAT, or IMITATE THE EXPERT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when in doubt, just make it more obvious - whatever that means in your situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we steadily improving in effectiveness (&lt;strong&gt;FOCUS ON FLOW&lt;/strong&gt;)? How can we do that even better?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when in doubt, &lt;strong&gt;mumble&lt;/strong&gt; your way through it by just picking a starting point, and refine the design later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you find yourself stuck
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find something that is difficult to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break it down into smallest meaningful chunks of skill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work through them piece by piece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus on the smallest meaningful chunk of skill, and the smallest number of tools, so that we can obtain the fluent action around those tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only introduce new MOVE or BITE-SIZED PIECES of learning right when we need them, and not before (&lt;strong&gt;JUST IN TIME&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anytime you notice yourself becoming lost, dizzy, or overwhelmed by the learning process, call &lt;strong&gt;FULL&lt;/strong&gt;, and go somewhere else, get a drink, take a breather, use the bathroom, whatever, but remember to come back and jump back into learning as soon as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading/learning can be a “priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn for better understanding of others and myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to make fewer mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to increase knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn to find meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read/learn improves vocabulary, focus, memory and imagination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odds are that no matter what you’re working on, someone somewhere, who is smarter than you, has probably thought about your problem and put it into a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are few things that hold us back and rob us our productivity, prosperity, positivity and peace of mind and reduce our capacity to think, focus, learn, grow, and be fully human
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drowning in data and rapid change, we long for strategies and tools to regain some semblance of productivity, performance, and peace of mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fleeting ping of digital dopamine pleasure replaces our ability to sustain the attention necessary for deep relationships, deep learning or deep work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overuse of digital technology results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities. Short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from underuse if we overuse technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we’re letting technology do much of our critical thinking and reasoning for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s a difference between reading for understanding and reading for information
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of people confuse knowing the name of something with understanding. While great for exercising your memory, regurgitating facts without solid understanding and context gains you little in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anything easily digested is reading for information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/&quot;&gt;work required to have an opinion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re a knowledge worker, you’re paid to use your brain, so it’s in your best interest to make that brain as efficient as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of pages you read is not as important as the fact you’re enjoying it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;review the notes and highlight them often with readwise.io&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;skim a lot of books and read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you lose interest, give it five more pages. Then skim the next chapter. If you’re still not interested, put it down. It’s the author’s job to keep your attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;marking a book is indispensable to reading it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep you awake, not merely conscious, but wide awake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If it is active, reading is thinking and tends to express itself in words, spoken or written.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing your reactions down helps you to remember the thoughts of the author&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomodoro method
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimal time for a task is 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. Each 25-minute chunk is called a “Pomodoro.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;skip liberally: skip anything that doesn’t interest you.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skip, but do so intelligently
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return to it later and ask yourself, “why did I skip this?” Did it offend you? Seem beneath you? Seem too difficult? And did you arrive at that by thinking it through, or is it a reflection of biases inherited from your parents and others? Very often, “our” beliefs are not our own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This practice is how you create yourself instead of discovering yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;find time to read boils down to choices about how you allocate your time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading isn’t something to be done once a week to check a box; it’s something to do every day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What gets in the way of reading?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid time commuting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid time shopping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid watching TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combine reading with idle activities, waiting for a bus, waiting for a taxi, on the train, on the plane, waiting for your flight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what I read depends on the situation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if there are few minutes, read something simple, rather disposable, and easily digested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;early in the evening, around 8-9, read something without interruption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before going to bed, read something light or something requiring more thought so I can ponder an idea while I’m falling asleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when I’m not reading, I’m trying to think about what I have just read (like waiting in the checkout line at the grocery store)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skimming and superficial reading can be used effectively to increase understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inspectional reading allows us to look at the author’s blueprint and evaluate the merits of a deeper reading experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 sub-types of inspectional reading
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;systematic skimming
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a quick check of the book by
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading preface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;studying the table of contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checking the index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading inside the jacket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give you sufficient knowledge to understand the chapters in the book, pivotal to the author’s argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skimming helps you reach a decision point: Does this book deserve more of my time and attention? If not, you put it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;superficial reading
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just read, don’t ponder the argument, don’t look things up, and don’t write in the margins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you don’t understand something, move on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;now that you understand the book’s contents and structure better, do you want to understand it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;analytical-reading&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#analytical-reading&quot; aria-label=&quot;analytical reading permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Analytical reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/marginalia/&quot;&gt;use marginalia to converse with the author&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the broken fragments of thought that appear scribbled in the margins of books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these fragments help us connect ideas, translate the jargon, and spur critical thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 rules to analytical reading
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;classify the book according to kind and subject matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;state what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in other words, you should be able to state the main question that the book tries to answer, and you should be able to state the subordinate questions if the main question is complex and has many parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after an inspectional read, you will understand the book and the author’s views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theoretical books teach you that something is the case. Practical books teach you how to do something you want to do or think you should do.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;involves reading many books on the same subject and comparing and contrasting ideas, vocabulary, and arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identifying relevant passages, translating the terminology, framing and ordering the questions that need answering, defining the issues, and conversing with the responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand the subject and develop deep fluency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identifying and filling in your knowledge gaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 steps to syntopical reading
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding the relevant passages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find the right books and then the passages that are most relevant to filling your needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bringing the author to terms
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify the keywords and how the author uses them. Each author has probably used different terms and concepts to frame their argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is an exercise in translation and synthesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the questions clear
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus on the questions that you want to answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s important to frame the questions so that all or most authors can be interpreted as providing answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;defining the issues
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask a clear question to which there are multiple answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;translated into your terms, must be ordered to one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understanding multiple perspectives on an issue helps you form an intelligent opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analyzing discussion
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s presumptuous to expect we will find a single unchallenged truth to any of our questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our answer is the conflict of opposing answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the value is the discussion you have with these authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can now have an informed opinion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you must try to discover the leading theme of the book and how the author develops her theme in an orderly way by subdividing it into its essential subordinate themes or topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you must try to discover the main ideas, assertions and arguments that constitute the author’s particular message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-the-book-true-in-whole-or-part&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#is-the-book-true-in-whole-or-part&quot; aria-label=&quot;is the book true in whole or part permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;is the book true, in whole or part?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you cannot answer this question until you have answered the first two. You have to know what is being said before you can decide whether it is true or not. When you understand a book, however, you’re obligated to make up your mind if you are reading seriously. Knowing the author’s mind is not enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the book has given you information, you must ask about its significance. Why does the author think it is important to know these things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it important to you to know them? And if the book has informed not only you but also enlightened you, it is necessary to seek further enlightenment by asking.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;listen with intent. Write notes in a way you can understand later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TIP
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T - Think about what you’re hoping to retain most from this session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I - identify what is most important in the context of your goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P - prioritize the information that is most valuable for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use your own words whenever possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;handwriting triumphs over typing because writing by hand requires you to exert more effort and process information immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;strong&gt;capture and create&lt;/strong&gt;. Fold the paper into two columns. On the left side, write down what you’re capturing. On the right, write your impression of potential applications, i.e., the areas you can apply this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before reading a new book, take a blank sheet of paper. Write down what you know about the subject you’re about to read - a mind map if you will&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after you’re done a reading session, spend a few minutes adding to the map (I use a different colour ink)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before you start your next reading session, review the mind map(I use mine as a bookmark sometimes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put these mind maps in a binder and periodically review them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you bought this thing, it’s your property, you need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/marginalia/&quot;&gt;write in the margins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the end of each chapter, write a few bullet points that summarize the main idea or specific points. Use your own words and not the author’s. Connect it to something in your life - a memory or another idea. Also, make note of any unanswered questions you had while reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you’re done with the book, put it down for a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick up the book again and go through all your notes. In many cases, reading your notes will be as good as reading the book again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing is the process by which we often discover we don’t know what we’re talking about.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 minutes of exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the timer for 4 minutes and open an easy-to-read book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start reading at a comfortable pace while using your finger to underline the words as you read them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when 4 minutes expire, mark the point at which you stopped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go back to where you started and set a timer for 3 minutes, then 2 minutes, then 1 minute. Try to get to the same point you reached after 4 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid regression, where your eyes tend to go back and re-read certain words in a sentence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a pacer because attention follows the movement. Using your finger to guide your reading prevents your attention from jumping around the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use your finger as a pacer when reading a physical book or the phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the mouse as a pacer when reading content on a computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid subvocalization: saying words to yourself in your head as you read.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you start reading, count 1, 2, 3, 4. This process will free your mind of the inner narrator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will train your mind to see words on the page like images. Turn what you’re reading into a motion picture experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid word-by-word reading
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;observe chunks of words at a single glance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice expanding your vision to see groups of words, i.e., images for groups of words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing the work required to hold on opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“what an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected business. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m no genius, I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“any fool can know. The point is to understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it takes one to know one”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True experts recognize the limits of what they know what what they do not know. If they find themselves outside of their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Skim a lot of books, read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blank sheet primes your brain for what you’re about to read and shows you what you’re learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding is a two way operation; the learner has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has to be willing to argue with the teacher, once he understands what the teacher is saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“go to bed smarter than when you woke up”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when it comes to reading, you don’t need to finish what you start”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pencil,” he argues, “becomes the sign of your alertness while you read”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“first you make your habits and then your habits make you”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“anything is good for your heart is good for you head”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifelong learning adds years to your life and life to your years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEAM: Together Everyone Achieve More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be kind to yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning is not solo, it’s social&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;genius leaves clues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no failure, only failure to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practice makes progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to understand is to know what to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the key to better comprehension is asking better questions”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you shall receive when you ask questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental techniques in dealing with people
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t criticize, condemn or complain. This makes them defensive and justifies their actions. Instead, praising them lowers their defence, and they will be more receptive to your feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give honest and sincere appreciation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arouse in the other person an eager want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;become genuinely interested in other people
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i.e., remember other people’s birthdays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;send LinkedIn messages of congratulations when someone in your network gets a promotion or professional success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coordinate office parties for personal celebrations such as births, accomplishments or birthdays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people crave the feeling of importance. “What is there about him that I can honestly admire?”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everyone has something they can teach you, and you benefit by figuring out what that is. This belief leads to genuine interest and appreciation for other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the other person feel important and do it sincerely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being good with people is about making people feel good/important and being interested in them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appeal to the other person’s interests. Virtually all people care more about what they want than what you want
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep asking yourself - “what is it that this person wants?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;angry people are often angry because they feel unheard. Once you sympathize with them, they will soften their anger substantially.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a person’s name is the most important word in any language. Use it often and respect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. Ask questions that they will enjoy answering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To influence to do things, praise and appreciation are more effective than orders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk in terms of the other person’s interests.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let the other person do a great deal of the talking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;smile
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;approach people with a positive demeanour. Smile and be happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;begin in a friendly way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dramatize your ideas. Sometimes ideas are not enough, and the truth must be made vivid, interesting, and dramatic. Television has been doing it for years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;throw down a challenge. The thing that most motivates people is the game. Everyone desires to excel and prove their worth. If we want someone to do something, we must give them a challenge, and they will often rise to meet it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the other person to say “yes, yes” immediately.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with questions to which the other person will answer yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not begin by emphasizing the aspects in which the other person and we differ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin by emphasizing and continue emphasizing the things on which we agree. People must be started in the affirmative direction, and they will often follow readily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never tell someone they are wrong, but rather lead them where we would like them to go with questions that they will answer “yes” to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appeal to nobler motives. Everyone likes to be glorious in their own eyes. People believe that they do things for noble and morally upright reasons. If we can appeal to others’ noble motives, we can successfully convince them to follow our ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making people glad to do what you want. Encourage people to think about everyone else’s perspective, have high expectations, and help people get what they want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not promise anything that you can not deliver. Forget about the benefits and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask yourself what is it the other person wants to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;match those benefits to the other person’s wants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he will benefit.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instead, approach with an open-minded view: “I may be wrong; I often am. And if I’m wrong, I want to change and be right. Let’s discuss the facts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;praise the other person for a trait that will help resolve the argument - like their patience, open-mindedness, fairness, and receptivity to new facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand that the other person has a valid view of the situation. Your job is to understand what led them to believe what they believe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;express sympathy for their situation. “You have the absolute right to be upset. If I were in your shoes, I would be too”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong.”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk through. Do NOT interrupt as they’re speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask people where they feel the problems are. Ask for their opinions on how best to proceed. Ask lots of questions instead of stating commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only way to get the best out of an argument is to avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for areas of agreement. Try to build bridges of understanding. Talk about common goals and what you agree on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let the other person feel that the idea is his or her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasize how your position serves the other person’s interests and incentives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you’re wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only way to get the best out of an argument is to avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things as you are. Think of them as people who want to help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;poop sandwich method
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bread: sincere appreciation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;poop: bad news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bread: a compliment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to keep a disagreement from being an argument
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welcome the disagreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distrust your first instinctive impression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;control your thoughts/temper. You can measure a person by what makes him/her angry. Little people get angry over little things. Big people are undisturbed and keep cool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;listen first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for areas of agreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks your opponents sincerely for their interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;begin with praise and honest appreciation, be specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introduce the point of improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk about your own related mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask questions instead of giving orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give the person a fine reputation to live up to. Act as though the trait were already one of his/her outstanding characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let the other people save face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be specific with your compliments and don’t give everyone the same compliments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frame the improvement in terms of the person’s own interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment. … Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not logical, we’re emotional, motivated by pride and vanity”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: ‘Imay be wrong, I frequently am. Let’s examine the facts.‘”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than condemn others, try to understand them. Try to figure out why they do what they do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all want to be appreciated”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people. The greatest asset I possess and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A drop of honey can catch more flies than a gallon of gall”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It should produce a wise agreement if an agreement is possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it should be efficient&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it should improve or at least not damage the relationship between the parties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid establishing a “bottom line” (worst acceptable outcome) in an attempt to protect themselves against a poor agreement since it would limit/prevent creativity in generating options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concentrate on assessing BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;power in a negotiation comes from the ability to walk away from talks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weaker party will better understand the negotiation context if they also try to estimate the other side’s BATNA.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when to refuse to budge from their positions, asking for reasons behind that position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when attacking the other side’s ideas, should take it as constructive criticism and invite further feedback and advice. Personal attacks should be recast as attacks on the problem. Generally, the principled party should use questions and strategic silences to draw the other party out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brought in a third party to interview each side separately to determine each side’s interests individually. Then the third party assembles the list of both sides’ interests and asks each side for their comments and criticism of the list. Then the third party works with both sides to hash out the proposals iteratively.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such as good guy/bad guy routines, uncomfortable seating, and leaks to the media. This could be responded to by explicitly raising issues in negotiations and engaging in principled negotiation to establish procedural ground rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parties may deliberate deception about the phoney facts, their authority, and their intentions. Principled negotiators may seek verification other side’s claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another common tactic is psychological warfare, such as using stressful environments, subtle personal attacks. Instead, the principled party could identify the problematic element and suggest a fair change or simply recognize what they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positional pressure tactics attempt to structure negotiations so that only one side can make concessions. The principled party may decline to recognize the commitment or the finality of the offer, instead of treating them as proposals or expressed interests, insist that any recommendations be evaluated on their merits, and don’t hesitate to point out dirty tricks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to work through people problems, think in terms of perception, emotion, and communication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;perception&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#perception&quot; aria-label=&quot;perception permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Perception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most conflicts are based on differing interpretations of the facts. Stick to the facts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;both sides must understand the other viewpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should not assume that their worst fears will become the other party’s actions. Nor should one side blame the other for their problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give them a stake in the outcome by letting them participate in the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make your proposal consistent with their values, and let them save face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;emotion&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#emotion&quot; aria-label=&quot;emotion permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Emotion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recognize and understand the feelings of all parties and the source of the feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t react to an emotional outburst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use symbolic gestures (gift-giving, etc…) to show empathy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make emotions explicit and acknowledge them as legitimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, allow the other side to let off steam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#communication&quot; aria-label=&quot;communication permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;employ active listening, such as giving speakers their full attention and acknowledging what is said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally, summarizing the speaker’s point to confirm their understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to remember that understanding the other’s case does not mean agreeing with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speakers should focus on communicating the intent and reasonings of themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid blaming and attacking the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak to be understood. You’re not trying to persuade some third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speak about yourself, not about them. However, it is more persuasive to describe a problem in terms of its impact on you and in words of what they did and why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the best way to deal with people’s problems is to prevent them from arising. People’s problems are less likely to come up if parties have a good relationship and think of each other as partners in negotiation rather than adversaries. Asks for help give the other party the comfortable feeling of knowing that someone owed them a favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a problem is defined in terms of the parties’ underlying interests, it is often possible to find a solution that satisfies both parties’ interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be hard on issues but soft on people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your positions are something you have decided upon. Your interests are what caused you to choose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to identify interests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask “why?” put yourselves in their shoes and try to figure out how they arrived at their positions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask “why not?” what interests of theirs stand in the way of your decision? Why do they not want what you want?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most powerful interests are basic human needs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic well-being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sense of belonging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control over one’s life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify shared interests
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shared interests are latent in every negotiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stressing your shared interests can make the negotiation smoother and more amicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find win-win options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 significant obstacles inhibit the inventing of an abundance of possibilities
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;premature judgement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;searching for the single answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assumption of the fixed pie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thinking that ” solving their problem is their problem.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create first, decide later. Separating the act of inventing options from the act of judging them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for items of low cost to you and high benefits to them and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;agree first on principles. Before even considering possible terms, you may want to decide on the standard or standards to apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never yield to pressure, only to the principal. When pressured, invite them to state their reasoning, suggest objective criteria that you think apply, and refuse to budget except on this basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the other parties’ reasoning to support your position can be a powerful way to negotiate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willing to reconsider their positions when there is reason to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frame each issue as a search for objective criteria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/consequences-of-dependency-inversion-principle&quot;&gt;move implementation choices up the call stack&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when we push implementation details up the call stack, we leave behind the minimum context needed to do the work. This makes the code as reusable as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;injecting an interface up front is &lt;em&gt;making a guess&lt;/em&gt; about the minimum context needed inside the method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overtime, to make the tests “better”, we extract details up into parameters. And then sometimes we extract interfaces on those new parameters. This is “fine tuning” the interactions between objects, gradually/relentlessly removing irrelevant details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the progress is usually similar to:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;function contains implementation details, forcing us into integrated tests (Example: database access inside domain code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extract and inject implementation details, which improves the design but often doesn’t make the tests nicer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extract interfaces on the implementation detail parameters, which makes the tests nicer (Example: replace database access with repository pattern)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invert the dependency, so that hte client knows there is database access. Client “injects” the data instead of the source of the data. (Example: replace repository pattern with Logic Sandwich/impure-pure-impure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DIP encourage us to isolate the steps from the workflow. This generally makes it easier to rearrange the steps into new workflows (new features are less expensive to build), but perhaps, more importantly, this makes it safer to reimplement some Steps to take advantage of distributed computing and parallelization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t instantiate the service if you can get your caller to do that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/consequences-of-dependency-inversion-principle&quot;&gt;move specificity towards the tests&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as the tests get more specific, the code get more generic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid call your dependency injection container from production code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“when in doubt, inject each dependency directly in the method that requires it”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“only when you inject the same dependency into multiple methods of the same class, move the parameter into the constructor”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“when a constructor parameter list becomes uncomfortably long, split the class so that the new classes’ constructors don’t overlap”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“if you notice a class using the same dependency through 2 different object graph routes, split the class so that the new class receive the dependency directly in their constructors”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“if you notice a class using groups of dependencies at different times, split the class, so that the new classes only use each cohesive group of dependencies”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“depends on things that change less often than you do”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some classes are more likely than other to have changes in requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concrete classes are more likely to change than abstract classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changing a class that has many dependencies will result in widespread consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an object has a dependency when it knows
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name of another class. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gear&lt;/code&gt; expects a class named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Wheel&lt;/code&gt; to exist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name of a message that it intends to send to someone other than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the arguments that a message requires &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gear knows that Wheel.new requires rim and title.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mostly unavoidable dependency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the order of those arguments &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gear knows the first argument to Wheel.new should be rim, tire the second&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dependencies cause these objects to act like a single thing. They move in lockstep; they change together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“some degree of dependency is inevitable, however, most dependencies are unnecessary”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;violate law of demeter (know too much internals of distant objects)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“for messages sent to someone other than self”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isolate the external messages when the dependency becomes dangerous. For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the external method is buried inside other complex code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are multiple calls to the external methods inside the class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the method is part of the private interface of another class&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;trade argument order dependency for an argument name dependency
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;argument name is more stable and provides explicit documentation of arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for simple methods, you’re better off accepting the argument order dependency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for complex method signatures, hashes fit better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;there are some cases in between where some arguments are required as stable (dependent on order) and some are less stable or optional (dependent on names by hash).&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;defaults&lt;/code&gt; method is an independent method that handles the complex logic for defaults and returns a hash. This hash is then merged to teh actual arguments hash.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;depend on things that change less often than you do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some classes are more likely to have changes in requirements compared to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concrete classes are more likely to change than abstract classes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abstract class: disassociated from any specific instance.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changing a class that has many dependents will result in widespread consequences, which would increase risks and fear in changing the class.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t worry about managing dependencies; we just inline and hard-code everything!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an excellent term (coined by Mark Seemann, above), in which we avoid having any dependencies in our core business logic. We do this by keeping all I/O and other impure code all the “edges” of our domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/dependencies/&quot;&gt;https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/dependencies/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependency parameterization, in which we pass in all dependencies as parameters. This is commonly used in conjunction with partial application.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in which we pass in dependencies after the rest of the code has already been constructed. This is typically done via constructor injection in OO-style code, and in FP-style principle, this corresponds to the Reader monad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/dependencies/&quot;&gt;https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/dependencies/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We replace calls to dependencies with a data structure interpreted later. This approach is used in both OO (interpreter pattern) and FP (e.g. free monads)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“push details up towards the client and push generic patterns down towards the server”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“never call your dependency injection container from production code”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;to build muscle in tiny or significant amounts, complete the bare minimum to activate local (muscle-specific) and systemic (hormonal) development processes&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Tracking = No awareness = No behavioural change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tracking the ratio of body composition and not weight. Ask yourself, &lt;strong&gt;“How much is a useful muscle, and how much is useful fat?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;four principles of failure proofing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make it conscious&lt;/strong&gt;, beware in real-time and not after the fact. For example, taking a picture of what you’re about to eat will make you think twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it a game&lt;/strong&gt;, measurement = motivation. Seeing any changes in numbers creates a positive feedback loop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make it competitive&lt;/strong&gt;, The potential loss is a more fantastic motivator than the potential reward. Use peer pressure to improve your performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make it minor and temporary&lt;/strong&gt;, ask yourself, “what is the smallest minimum change that I can make”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contracts to tie you to finish what you’ve started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of incentives for completing a task in its entirety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a diary. Maintaining a journal allows you to balance embracing the past and planning for the future.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fasting is an excellent tool for stimulating concentration and metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make short fasts, consume all the foods of the day between 6 and 8 hours and then only feed again on the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both prevent chronic diseases and increase muscle mass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your body operates with ketones, you get a greater focus, more concentration and more energy because your blood sugar level stabilizes during ketosis.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bread, potatoes, sweet potatoes, spaghetti, tortillas, fried meals, wholegrain carbohydrates such as brown rice, wholegrain bread, oats, quinoa, amaranth, starches, and sweets, sugar substitutes&lt;/strong&gt; must all be avoided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Splenda has no calories. It causes weight gain by raising the number of harmful bacteria in your stomach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fruits are high in vitamins, but they are also high in fructose. Avocados and tomatoes, in moderation, are exceptions to this rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lemons and limes are also beneficial to one’s overall health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dairy such as milk, yogurt, creams, and cheeses should be avoided at all costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the goal of this diet is to reduce blood sugar levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carbohydrates in the diet are converted into blood sugar, commonly known as glucose. Foods with a high glycemic index dramatically boost blood sugar levels, such as wheat, rice, and potatoes. Low-glycemic foods, such as vegetables and fish, have little impact on blood sugar levels. Glucose is required for all living things to survive, but excessive quantities cause weight gain, heart disease, and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;warm-up exercise help in muscle activation. An example of such an exercise is performing 5-second squats followed by jumps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Tabata protocol to increase endurance, rather than the standard guidance of running high volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This high-intensity interval training involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise with progressively quicker recovery.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid white carbohydrates, i.e. all bread, cereal, potatoes, pasta, and fried food with breading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eat the same meals over and over again. Foods that produce the fastest weight loss include proteins, legumes, and vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t drink calories instead, drink massive amounts of water, unsweetened tea, wine and low-calorie beverages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t eat fruit. You don’t need to eat fruit every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take one day off per week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example diet
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breakfast: one cup of coffee and one egg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lunch: fajita bowl (Onions, peppers, tomato salsa, tomatillo salsa, sour cream, romaine lettuce, steak, cheese)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dinner: fajita bowl (Onions, papers, tomato salsa, tomatillo salsa, sour cream, romaine lettuce, steak, cheese)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you NEED to snack between meals, carrots are the best thing to eat but do not eat too many&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only fruits allowed in the diet are tomatoes and avocado. Avocados should be limited to one unit per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;common mistakes to avoid&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not eating within an hour or 30 minutes of waking up and skipping breakfast will result in overeating in the evening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not eating enough protein eating proteins in the morning will curb your impulses to eat later and promote a negative fat balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not drink enough water - drinking enough water will ensure optimal liver function for fat loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;believing that you’ll cook, especially if you are a bachelor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mistiming weight loss with your menstrual cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overeating common foods: nuts, chickpeas, hummus, peanuts, macadamias. These foods are great on a diet but prone to portion abuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overconsuming artificial sweeteners - artificial sweeteners provoke increased insulin release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hitting the gym too often - doing too much can result in overeating and may reverse your progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do four things: the squat, the bench, the deadlift, and compete in lifting competitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not attempt a rep unless you’re 100% sure you will make it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give NoFap a try&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Exhale all the air out of your lungs and pull in your belly towards your spine until you can’t pull it further. If it burns, you’re doing it correctly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold your breath in your belly in that position for about 10 seconds, then take one breath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do it again.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 minute 30 seconds of profound relaxing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 minute 15 seconds of cleansing (breathing air out hard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hold the breath for an objective of brief 30 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take three semi-cleanse breaths (the ideal approach to characterize this is between a full breath and a cleanse)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 minute 30 seconds of profound relaxing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 minute 30 seconds of cleansing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hold the breath for 2 minutes and 30 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take three semi-cleanse breaths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 minutes of deeply relaxing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 minute 45  seconds of cleaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hold your breath as far as might be feasible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take 3-10 hard semi-cleanse breaths until you recuperate.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I’ve known that the key to getting started down the path of being remarkable in anything is to simply act to be remarkable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“magnesium and calcium are easiest to consume in pill form, and 500 milligrams of magnesium taken before bed will also improve sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“make it conscious, make it a game, make it competitive, make it small and temporary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re what we do repeatedly”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;success, however you define it, is achievable if you collect the right field-tested beliefs and habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the superheroes you have in your mind (idols, icons, titans, billionaires, etc.) are nearly all walking flaws who’ve maximized 1 or 2 strengths)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what might you do to accomplish your 10-year goals in the next six months if you had a gun against your head?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;routine, in an intelligent man, is a sign of ambition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn things once and use them forever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a toolkit for changing your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;judge a man by his questions rather than his answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it contains low-hanging fruit with immediate returns. Think of the bite-sized rules within these pages as PED(s) - performance-enhancing details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for the black sheep who fit your unique idiosyncrasies. Keep an eye out for the non-traditional paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this book is a buffet. Here’s how to get the most out of it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;skip liberally: skip anything that doesn’t interest you.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;like 50%, love 25%, and never forget 10%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skip, but do so intelligently
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return to it later and ask yourself, “why did I skip this?” Did it offend you? Seem beneath you? Seem too difficult? And did you arrive at that by thinking it through, or is it a reflection of biases inherited from your parents and others? very often, “our” beliefs are not our own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This practice is how you create yourself instead of discovering yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the context and original language teach you how to THINK like a world-class performer, not just regurgitate quotes. That is the crucial meta-skill we’re aiming for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 tools that allow all the rest&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can think: of having good rules for decision-making and having good questions you can ask yourself and others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can wait: being able to plan the long-term, play the long game, and not misallocate your resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can fast: being able to withstand difficulties and disaster. Training yourself to be uncommonly resilient and have a high pain tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ferriss emphasizes the importance of exercising to improve fitness, never hurting yourself, and don’t go overboard. Working out somewhere with a soft surface is recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consistency is what’s important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AcroYoga helps relax, loosen the muscles and prepare the body for sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training the areas of weakness is the area that causes the most physical pain. Thus, the body and mind must be prepared to deal with chronic pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle strength workouts stabilize the body’s metabolism, bone health, and immune system. Gaining strength in these areas creates a sense of confidence to continue strength training, flexibility and endurance in others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommend exercises like races, jumps, and squats for pure muscle extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sneakers have slight heel rises, which causes them to extend the Achilles heel and affect the ankle’s mobility. So you should avoid them. Instead, wear sneakers with flat soles and keep your toes and heels aligned at the same height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard mattresses keep your muscles extended. Soft beds are best for modern humans sitting in an office or car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ideal place to sleep is in a hammock. Try an acupressure mattress, which helps relieve back pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;daily simple strength exercise:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one-arm kettlebell swing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turkish kettlebell get-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kettlebell goblet squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combining exercises with Breathing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do as many pushups as possible in one set. Stop short of failure. Note down how many you did and rest for 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the following 40 times: maximum inhale followed by a ‘let go’ exhale - dropping your chest sharply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on the final round, inhale, exhale, then do another set of pushups. See if you can do more pushups after this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires that you demonstrate strength throughout the entire range of motion, including the end ranges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kelly Starrett: try squatting to the ground while keeping your feet and knees together. This indicates your mobility in the motion range in your hip and ankle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommend doing light, narrow-stance overhead squats in combination with cossack squats as a way of improving your mobility in these areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the heels flat on the ground, your knees directly above your toes, and your hips as close to the ground as possible when you switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cow stretch (aka cat-cow or cat camel in yoga). Spend as much time as you can in a low lunge and work on shoulder rotation using the Burgener warm-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;hyperthermic conditioning, aka calculated heat exposure.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It probably would improve your endurance and increase your GH (growth hormone levels).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular saunas post-workout. Just 20 minutes 3-4 times a week at a temperature of 160-170 F can be highly beneficial for reducing DOMS (delayed-onset muscle soreness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cold therapy to improve immunity and mood and increase fat loss.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start small, and end your shower with 30-60 seconds of pure cold water. Then, gradually increase the time spent under cold water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drinking a large amount of water daily to maintain optimum health. Add a pinch of salt to your water to aid with hydration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use manuka honey bandages for treating wounds. Manuka honey is very expensive, produced only in Australia and New Zealand, and evaluated by medicine to improve the immune system and prevent colds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oolong tea, the goto kola leaf liquid extract, is believed to have the power to improve stretch marks and cellulite on the body, and the Hitachi magic wand vibrator, is used to soothe muscles.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;people should only eat carbohydrates or sugars if they have a good body mass index. A person should have less than 10% body fat&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the low-carb and ketogenic diet for optimum health
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the keto diet is essentially a low-carb, high-fat diet designed to imitate the state of fasting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than using blood sugar (glucose) as your energy source, the body becomes dependent on ketones derived from fat. Few benefits are fat loss, better body composition, potential anti-cancer effects, improvement of oxygen consumption, and increased overall strength and health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the same low-carb meals regularly. For example, have the same thing for breakfast every day, do the same for lunch, and if you require some variation, you can mix up your dinners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never drink calories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid fruit, too many sugars in fruit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure your body fat percentage. If you can see this dropping, then you’re on the right track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take one day off per week and eat whatever you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fasting can help re-setting your body and immune system, stimulating stem-cell regeneration. It is recommended to try a 5-day fast 2-3 times per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;intermittent-fasting&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#intermittent-fasting&quot; aria-label=&quot;intermittent fasting permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Intermittent fasting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eats one meal a day in a four-hour window, followed by twenty hours of fasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This strategy is in line with the ketogenic diet, in which the body begins to use stored fat as an energy source rather than using glucose. This results in burning body fat and increased ability to gain muscle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intermittent fasting helps to expel cancer cells from the body. However, ketogenic diets are about 80% fat, and you should avoid starches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exogenous ketones are also recommended: supplements that help the body achieve or maintain the highest performing ketogenic states. However, these supplements are costly and can induce nausea and induce vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;should not undervalue your product and not charge enough. By not charging enough for a product, you’re only undercutting yourself. You’re left with not enough money actually to market the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know the value of what you are selling. Don’t get greedy and aim for volume.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you’re earlier in your career, the best strategy is to say ‘yes’ to every little gig. You never know what the lottery tickets are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t instinctively think, “HELL, YES, I WILL DO THAT,” then say ‘no.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you’ve found your rhythm and made progress, it’s time to stop filling your time with menial and mediocre tasks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;being busy means lacking priorities, so commit to things worth it and reject the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Being busy is most often used as a guide for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One way to deal with procrastination and business is to identify just ONE must-do daily task.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;obsession with not losing money. Before entering any business opportunity or investment, ask yourself what the downside is and how you can be protected against it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obsessed with asymmetrical risk and reward. This essentially means that they are focused on minimum risk with maximum results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset allocation and margin of safety to diversify your portfolio in case you make wrong decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passionate about giving and being generous. It wasn’t tight or overly frugal.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;start by exploring an idea emotionally, than do traditional due diligence using objective data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;if you have set well-thought-out and intelligent rules, then FOLLOW THE RULES NO MATTER WHAT. You set the rules with intentions, don’t break them when something tempting comes up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most startups will fail. So to cover your losses, you need to ensure that the successes are worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it comes to investing and angel investments, you must be 100% comfortable losing all of your money. Therefore, you should only gamble with an amount you can afford to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit angel investment funds to 10-15% of your liquid assets. Nevermore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When designing a product, you must be keen to use the product yourself. If it’s not something you’re interested in, avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by focusing on ‘systems’ rather than ‘goals,’ you allow yourself to improve your skills and relationship without focusing too much on the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and improve transferable skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t treat your systems as a binary pass/fail situation. Instead, consider systems as something that can have a snowball effect.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;either be the best at one specific thing or be very good (top 25%) at two or more items. The first option is almost impossible, which few people will ever achieve. But the second strategy is simple and something everyone is capable of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add public speaking as one of your two (or more) skills, combining being an excellent public speaker with any other skill, and you have the recipe for some pretty decent success.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;in business, you have to get comfortable asking for things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confident enough to put yourself out there. The following 5-6 times you order a coffee, ask for 10% off. Doing this a few times will improve your confidence and help you get comfortable with asking.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;before releasing a product or service, exposing them to proper scrutiny is essential. For example, select the first ten people (red team) to critique and break an idea apart.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s what you do consistently.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge is redundant without consistent, purposeful action. A similar theme addressed by Peter Thiel is that education does not equate to learning. Thiel is more interested in what people learn rather than what educational credentials they are working on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero to one questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The monopoly question&lt;/strong&gt;: are you starting with a significant share of a small market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The secret question&lt;/strong&gt;: have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The distribution question&lt;/strong&gt;: do you have a way not just to create but deliver your product?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;preparing for the worst conditions enables individuals to stand up when faced with failures and falls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guru Tony Robbins has a great morning routine for developing strength. His method involves diving into the ice water for 30 to 90 seconds. That prepares his body to take action and trains his mind. When it says it will do something, such as entering an icy river, it doesn’t matter if it will feel uncomfortable. He can do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing Tetris between 6-24 hours after a traumatic episode helps prevent post-traumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related problems. In addition, Tetris is a visual replacement strategy that helps with other obsessions, addictions, eating compulsions and insomnia.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everyone wants freedom, but few people have the discipline to reach it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the modern world of technology, social networking and unlimited distractions, the ability to focus on a single task is a “superpower.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some progression in flexibility and mobility can only be achieved by regular physical exercise rather than intensity.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose a particular goal you want to achieve and write that goal on a piece of paper 15 times daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The important thing is not the method but its focus and commitment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By focusing your memory and mind on a particular goal, you’re utilizing a part of your brain known as the reticular activation system. As a result, the universe begins to send opportunities he never imagined, things he saw as coincidences but which continued to happen.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to make money, you only need 1000 true fans. A “true fan” is someone who will buy everything you produce. It is important to differentiate that this approach will help you make money but not a fortune.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you are terrified of the humiliation that failure can bring, then use that as your motivation to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear is designed to keep us safe.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself if your fear should be a top priority.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to embrace fear, you must define the worst-case scenario for any event or outcome. Understand precisely what would happen and identify how you might be affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By defining your fears, you’ll find that you’re working towards conquering these fears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate the negative outcome on a scale of 1-10 and consider whether they are permanent or temporary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, consider what actions you would take to correct the adverse outcomes. Finally, how easy would it be to get back on track?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost-benefit analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In other words, you’re risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a probable and permanent 9 or 10.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t focus on how many people don’t get it or don’t get you. Focus on how many people do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expect that people will take things personally. 10% of people will find a way to take anything personally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when in doubt - starve it of oxygen (ignore it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t over-apologize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t reason someone out of something they didn’t reason themselves into&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t try to get everyone to like you. Confront the people who need confronting&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“the most important trick to being happy is realizing that happiness is a choice you make and a skill you develop. You choose to be happy, and then you work at it. It’s just like building muscles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90% of our thoughts are based on our fears. Which only leaves 10% left for focusing on desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire is your commitment to being unhappy until you get what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you spend your day desiring things you don’t have, you’re destined to be disappointed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So select your desires carefully and only have one big desire at any time to maintain a sense of peace. On the other hand, if you have too many desires at one time, then unhappiness is inevitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an obsession with yourself is a constant cause of suffering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice kindness, in which you desire the happiness of others, and in return, you feel happier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice saying the words “I love you” in her mind whenever she meets a stranger before she even talks to them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This practice is a way of ensuring that she is not judged negatively. Criticism and negative judgement are a way to feel superior while avoiding introspection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seeks to be the first to smile at someone and say ‘hello’ - to friends and even strangers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Happiness is wanting what you have.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when facing a new situation, there are three options: you can change it, accept it, or leave it. It’s essential to choose one of these options and not the terrible fourth option: sitting around, wishing you could change it, but simply accepting it, or wishing you could leave it, but changing it, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;training hard, then having a de-load week where the volume and intensity reduced significantly. It’s about using this as downtime for the body to recover and prepare for the next intensity period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferriss explains that he’ll batch an intense period of complex and similar tasks such as podcasting, emails, writing blogs and accounting. He’ll then alternate this with scheduled periods of downtime where he can do whatever he wants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Deloading blocks must be scheduled and defended more strongly than your business commitments. The former can strengthen and inform the latter, but not vice versa.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meditation practice is typically recommended in the morning routine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditation has been associated with a wide range of physiological and mental benefits, including lower blood pressure, improved cognition and lower levels of anxiety&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;busy is a sign that your mind is out of control and chaotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being available and having time for others and yourself means that you are in control of your day and life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chronic culture of occupation reflects the lack of priorities and the lack of self-respect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 minutes a day is all you need to be efficient, and being busy is not a valid excuse because if you do not have 10 minutes, you do not have a life.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reality is largely negotiable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if you stress-test the boundaries and experiment with the “impossible,” you’ll quickly discover that most limitations are a fragile collection of socially reinforced rules you can choose to break at any time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I did the opposite for 48 hours?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I did the opposite of all the other sales guys for 48 hours?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I only asked questions instead of pitching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what if I studied technical material, so I sounded like an engineer instead of a sales guy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what if I ended my emails with, “I understand if you’re too busy to reply, and thank you for reading this far,”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do I spend a silly amount of money on? How might I scratch my itch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would I do/have/been if I had $10 million? What’s my real TMI (target monthly income)?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/lifestyle-costing/&quot;&gt;life style costing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the worst things that could happen? Could I get back here?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/&quot;&gt;fear setting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would I do if I could only work 2 hours per week on my business?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80% (or more) of your desired outcomes result from 20&amp;#x26;(or less) of your activities and inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What 20% of customers/products/regions produce 80% of the profit?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting 90% of retail customers on autopilot with simple terms and standardized order processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what if I let them make decisions up to $100? $500? $1000?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get huge, good things done, you need to be okay with letting the small, bad things happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people’s IQs seem to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the least six minor crowded channels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine if I couldn’t pitch my product directly?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don’t like being sold products, but we all want to be told stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what if I created my real-world MBA?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2010/06/28/mba/&quot;&gt;my real-world MBA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do I need to make it back the way I lost it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I could only subtract to solve problems?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should we simplify?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I put on my not-to-do list?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What might I put in place to allow me to go off the grid for 4-8 weeks without phone or email?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It forces you to put systems and policies in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empower other people with rules and tools, separate the critical few from the trivial many&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hunting antelope or field mice?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which one of these, if done, would render all the rest either easier or completely irrelevant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could it be that everything is fine and complete as is?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivating more daily appreciation and present state awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have to want what you already have&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would this look like if it were easy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I throw money at this problem? How can I “waste” money to improve the quality of my life?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’ve got enough money to solve the problem, you don’t have the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spend money to earn time as time is non-renewable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No hurry, no pause.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get 95% of the desired results by calmly putting one foot in front of the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luxury is feeling unrushed. No hurry, no pause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;an old relationship that really helped you or valued highly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an opportunity you have today. Perhaps that’s just an opportunity to call one of your parents or a chance to go to work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something significant that happened yesterday, whether you experienced or witnessed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something simple near you or within sight.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tonight or tomorrow morning, think of a decision you’ve been putting off and challenge the fuzzy “what ifs” holding you hostage. If not now, when? If left at the status quo, what will your life and stress look like in 6 months? In 1 year? In 3 years? Who around you will also suffer?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;something you don’t remember&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your darkest teacher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the memory of physical injury&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;being loved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what you were thinking&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Learn to confront the challenges of the real world, rather than report to the protective womb of academia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am a big believer that if you have an obvious vision of where you want to go, the rest of it is much easier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you’re thinking of how to make your business bigger, it’s tempting to try to think all the big thoughts, the world-changing, massive-action plans. But please know that it’s often the tiny details that thrill someone enough to make them tell all their friends about you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you would not want to be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading or do things worth writing.” - Ben Franklin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What is the ultimate quantification of success? For me, it’s not how much time you spend doing what you love. It’s how little time you spend doing what you hate.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once we get those muddy, maddening, confusing thoughts [nebulous worries, jitters, and preoccupations] on the page, we face our day with clearer eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I have come to learn that part of the business strategy is to solve the simplest, easier, and most valuable problem.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“So if you’re planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10-year plan of how to get there, you should ask: Why can’t you do this in 6 months?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are no actual rules, so make rules that work for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only have one skill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“At the end of the day, who cares? What’s the big deal? I’m here, I’m going to try my best, and I’m going to go home, and my family’s there. Even though my whole world’s wrapped up in this, who cares?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greatness comes from humble beginnings. It comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room - until you change that with results. There is an old saying, “say little, do much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Truth is, young creative minds don’t need more ideas. Instead, they need to take more responsibility with the ideas they’ve already got.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In reality, long-term travel has nothing to do with demographics - age, ideology, income - and everything to do with personal outlook. Long-term travel isn’t about being a college student - it’s about being a student of daily life. Long-term travel doesn’t require a massive “bundle of cash”; it requires only that we walk through the world more deliberately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more freedom to be gained from practicing poverty than chasing wealth. Suffer a little regularly, and you often cease to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life is not waiting for the storm to pass. Instead, it’s learning how to dance in the rain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Accept reality, but focus on the solution. Take that issue, take that setback, take that problem, and turn it into something good. Go forward. If you’re part of a team, that attitude will spread throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ours is a culture where we wear the ability to get by on very little sleep as a kind of badge of honour that symbolizes work ethic, or toughness or some other virtue - but really, it’s a total profound failure of priorities and self-respect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Titans create their own rules, which allow them to transform their reality according to their will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Everyone wants freedom, but few people have the discipline to reach it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“overestimate what we can accomplish a day, underestimate what we can accomplish in a year.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“focus on small daily actions that compound over a long time.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when in doubt, zoom out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it’s scary to put yourself out there, to expose yourself, to become vulnerable, but it makes all the differences. Be a man, woman in the arena. When you let your mind wander in its truly natural state, good things happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;want to get unstuck, go for a walk, no phone, no music, no podcast, just you, your thought and the fresh air.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“be deliberate about what you spend your time on and who you spend it with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“not matter how far you go, always remember, you didn’t make it on your own, pay it forward, be a mentor, be a champion for others, their growth should be your tremendous source of joy and pride.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Productivity is for robots. What humans are going to be good at is asking questions, being creative, and experiencing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;judge a person by his/her questions rather than his/her answers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“my goal for each reader to like 50%, love 25%, and never forget 10%.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Success, however you define it, is achievable if you collect the right field-tested beliefs and habits.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The superheroes you have in your mind (idols, icons, titans, billionaires, etc…) are nearly all walking flaws who’ve maximized 1 or 2 strengths…; you succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not the strongest. I’m not the fastest. But I’m good at suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone fighting a battle that you know nothing about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Routine, in an intelligent man, is a sign of ambition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;very often, “our” beliefs are not our own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I become less competitive in order that I can become more successful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me something that’s true that very few people agree with you on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the legacy system already has an established model, albeit implicit, which can seldom be changed with a reasonable effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simply adding objects that express a distinct model without changing the ones already there will lead to conflicting rules and concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing a complex new set of development principles and techniques is best done incrementally as in a pilot project, in a way that allows members of the team to gain experience and allows the organization to assess the approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This pilot project allows a small team to achieve a modest objective involving some complex domain logic and, ideally, one with some strategic value that is difficult to solve in a legacy context. Therefore, it is recommended to cherry-pick a small, self-disciplined team with control over its code to evolve a model that addresses the chosen area, relatively unconstrained by the concepts of the legacy systems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new functionality does not disappear. It will continue to be maintained as an extension of the legacy systems. The organization now has the experience to undertake more ambitious use of DDD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no synchronization risk (uses a legacy database)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;works when there is a limited range of data needed from legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A ‘bubble’ is a small bounded context established using an Anticorruption Layer (ACL) for the purpose of a particular development effort and not intended necessarily to be expanded or used for a long time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACL should be explicitly addressed in budgeting and planning. It should be designed to keep it decoupled from the actual business logic of the new system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good anti-corruption layer has a clean interface entirely in terms of the downstream model (in our case, the bubble model) that provides access to the information and services of the upstream system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACL allows development in the downstream context to focus on the business problem and not be distracted or complicated by dealing with the other system’s distinct concepts and quirks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any new information needed from the legacy context requires incorporating the new data into the bubble model, working out the mapping from the old model, and then the ACL. That’s a high price, so we should choose functionality valuable enough to justify it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development in the bubble could go on for several months or, occasionally, in cases where the interface with other contexts is relatively narrow for a few years. However, it will not last forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bubble becomes the primary context for more ambitious new development. When this happens, the limitations of the bubble context may be judged unacceptable, and the strategy migrates to the autonomous bubble with synchronizing ACL. Then the bubble transforms into something more long-lasting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;strategy-2-autonomous-bubble&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#strategy-2-autonomous-bubble&quot; aria-label=&quot;strategy 2 autonomous bubble permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;strategy 2: autonomous bubble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The autonomous bubble is distinguished by the ability to run its software, for a time, cut off from other systems. Information may start to get stale, requests to external service requests start to queue up unfulfilled, but the internal behaviour of the software continues to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;needs organization committed to significant new development with a unique design approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows new data to be collected and used without involving legacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows decoupled “product” to evolve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;may progress from a bubble context as development is scaled up on a successful pilot project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable autonomous context having its own data, ACL takes on the responsibility of synchronization between data stores in 2 contexts, which do not depend directly on each other. This ACL activity is asynchronous with any action in either context, with a service level agreement (SLA) regarding the freshness of the translated data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this could involve importing data from a file, kicking off a SQL script, taking data from one table, transforming it, and inserting it into another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SLA: open of business, next business day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unnecessary coupling: synchronizing ACL mixed in with once-per-day business logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unnecessary coupling: multiple ACL(s) to various contexts lumped together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make sure you isolate the data copying and translation for your particular context into modules (one per context you are drawing on)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This approach can support a range of SLA(s) and update a system while it is being used, while - batch scripts typically run while systems are off-line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any information crossing a context boundary must be translated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messages are always expressed in some language based on some system of abstractions (a model), and we should not let them enter a context that uses a different vocabulary and model.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In the Bubble context, any new information that does not already exist in the legacy system somewhere must be added to the legacy system somewhere, even though it will not be used there! Then it must be mapped into the bubble context, increasing the dependency between the two systems. Clearly, this is not the strategy to introduce crucial new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development in the autonomous bubble is not so tightly bound to the older contexts. Therefore, the model in this context can be more innovative and trow more freely, and a fresh new product can be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one of the main challenges of SOA is the lack of attention to bounded contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with the legacy system, every new development effort gets dragged back into the old concepts and potentially tangled into the old implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy assets were developed with a particular feature set in mind and are highly coupled to those features. This makes it hard to access what you want directly without going through layers designed for a very different purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open host service over anticorruption layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commons Context, the most basic and widely used information, can be interchanged throughout the organization via one standard interchange model, the “Tragedy of the Commons.” But, unfortunately, the commons are prone to dumping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FIX has a way of describing an enormous range of financial trades and transactions and is used to interchange data between all sorts of organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a focused language, crafted for a modest suite of related services, usually gives the most satisfying balance between the fragmentation of the one-off service model and the total unification of the commons and the industry-standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we should get over the attitude that the ultimate goal is to eventually replace these older systems. That is a futile treadmill. Creating a bubble can allow you to selectively move responsibilities for the core domain, where you want to innovate, out into a new context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open host services over an ACL can give convenient, decoupled access to functionality and data assets embedded in the older systems. Once the legacy system is stable, not responsible for the core domain, and provides access to assets, why not let it be? You have better things to do right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one challenge that is particularly acute in a bubble is how critical it is to coordinate the incremental development of the new business functionality and the anticorruption layer in parallel. This affects the design and the planning of the sequence in which the features are written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design freedom is the point of a bubble, the bubble context with an umbilical ACL gives a little freedom, while the autonomous bubble can give a lot if properly managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things to think about for ACL
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does the new feature draw on information that is already being brought in by the existing anti-corruption layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will it require new mapping of legacy information? what is the scope of that work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if multiple features were chosen for the iteration call for new mapping, are they drawing on the same information, or does each call for different information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to make development manageable, the priority of business features must be balanced with the need to group work on features that use similar legacy data sets, with parallel planning of the necessary enhancements to the anticorruption layer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if not careful, the bulk of the project’s effort will go into implementing a big translator interface, each element of which is only sparsely used. This gives a low ROI for the context boundary, and eventually an unsustainable maintenance burden. Or developers would take shortcuts by making sloppy mappings or simply bypassing the ACL, pull the data they need directly from the legacy system, and the context boundary will erode and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the developers working on various features all drawing that same data can collaborate to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;model the new information by adding concepts to the bubble context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extend the ACL to bring in the new information. (This should be an explicit development task, not just part of a ‘user story’)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to reuse the fields/data from legacy without a mapping is a mistake. The concept represented by those fields was never mapped to a concept in the downstream context. We have no idea what they mean in the downstream context or how they relate to other concepts in the downstream model. It creates bigger objects with more dependencies and that is poorly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you must make choice, try to make the bubble’s model capable of expressing the essential meaning of the new information in terms consistent with the other concepts of that model. It is inadvisable to load objects down with information that does not directly pertain to their jobs, so it is best to do a bit more modelling work to find good homes for the new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bypass the context altogether, give the client access to the context where the information originated or pass it some other way (particularly when the new data is for display only) Sometimes this is a good time to expose a legacy asset with a service as in Strategy 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pass the information unchanged through new context. (Not recommended) since you have bored a tunnel through your anticorruption layer and compromised your ability to evolve your new model independently of the legacy system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;adding data is a modelling job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a way of referring to some aspect of some business situation, and the goal when translating this new element into your bubble context is to enrich the ubiquitous language to be able to express these concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explore new scenarios in the DDD modelling whirlpool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in order to pull in more data to use in logic or key definitions in your context, you should follow the whirlpool steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hammer out a reference scenario that illustrates why you need a new information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brainstorm model changes that incorporate that information organically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;context boundary leakage gets out of hand quickly and suddenly you may wake up to realize that your new software is conforming to the legacy model and does not give the desired fresh start for the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain-Driven Design is an approach to the development of complex software in which we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the core domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore the models in a creative collaboration of domain practitioners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;speak a ubiquitous language within an explicitly bounded context.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bounded-context&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bounded-context&quot; aria-label=&quot;bounded context permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bounded Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explicitly define the context within which a model applies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explicitly set boundaries in team organization, usage within specific application parts, and physical manifestations such as code bases and database schemas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply continuous integration to keep the model concepts and terms strictly consistent within these bounds, but don’t be distracted or confused by issues outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ubiquitous-language&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ubiquitous-language&quot; aria-label=&quot;ubiquitous language permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ubiquitous Language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the model as the backbone of a language. Then, commit the team to exercise that language relentlessly in all communication within the team and in the code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the same language in diagrams, writing, and speech within a bounded context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize that a change in the language is a change to the model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iron out difficulties by experimenting with alternative expressions, which reflect alternative models. Then refactor the code, renaming classes, methods, and modules to conform to the new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolve confusion over terms in conversation, in just the way we come to agree on the meaning of ordinary words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tightly relating the code to an underlying model gives the code meaning and makes the model relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design a portion of the software system to reflect the domain model literally so that the mapping is obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revisit the model and modify it to be implemented more naturally in software, even as you seek to make it reflect deeper insight into the domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demand a single model that serves both purposes well, in addition to supporting a ubiquitous fluent language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any technical person contributing to the model must spend some time touching the code, whatever primary role they play on the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone responsible for changing code must learn to express a model through the code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every developer must be involved in discussing the model and contact domain experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who contribute in different ways must consciously engage those who touch the code in a dynamic exchange of model ideas through the ubiquitous language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isolate the expression of the domain model and the business logic, and eliminate any dependency on infrastructure, user interface, or even application reason that is not business logic. Concentrate all the code related to the domain model in one layer and isolate it from the user interface, application, and infrastructure code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The domain objects, free of the responsibility of displaying themselves, storing themselves, managing application tasks, and so forth, can be focused on expressing the domain model.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This allows a model to evolve to be rich enough and clear enough to capture essential business knowledge and put it to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an object is distinguished by its identity rather than its attributes, make this primary to its definition in the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the class definition simple and focused on life cycle continuity and identity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a means of distinguishing each object regardless of its form or history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be alert to requirements that call for matching objects by attributes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define an operator that is guaranteed unique. This means of identification may come from the outside, or it may be an arbitrary identifier created by and for the system. Still, it must correspond to the identity distinctions in the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka reference objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you care only about the attributes and logic of an element of the model, classify it as a value object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it express the meaning of the attributes it conveys and give it related functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat the value object as immutable. Make all operations side-effect-free functions that don’t depend on any mutable state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t give a value object any identity and avoid the design complexities necessary to main entities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;model information about activity in the domain as a series of discrete events. Represent each event as a domain event object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are distinct from system events that reflect activity within the software itself. However, a system event is often associated with a domain event, either as part of a response to the domain event or to carry information about the domain event into the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore irrelevant domain activity while making explicit the events that the domain experts want to track or be notified of or associated with state change in the other model objects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a significant transformation process in the domain is not a natural responsibility of an entity or value object, add an operation to the model as a standalone interface declared as a service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a service contract, a set of assertions about interactions with the service. State these assertions in the ubiquitous language of a specific bounded context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the service a name, which also becomes a ubiquitous language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concepts should be divided into modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose modules that tell the story of the system and contain a cohesive set of ideas. Give the modules the names that become part of the ubiquitous language. Modules are part of the model, and their names should reflect insight into the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek low coupling in the sense of concepts that can be understood and reasoned about independently. Then, refine the model until it partitions according to high-level domain concepts and decouples the corresponding code.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it challenging to guarantee the consistency of changes to objects in a model with complex associations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster the entities and value objects into aggregates and define boundaries around each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose one entity to be the root of each sum, and allow external objects to hold references to the source only (regarding internal members passed out for use within a single operation only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define properties and invariants for the aggregate as a whole and give enforcement responsibility to the root or some designated framework mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the exact aggregate boundaries to govern transactions and distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;within an aggregate edge, apply consistency rules synchronously. Across borders, handle updates asynchronously
keep an aggregate together on one server. Allow different sums to be distributed among nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;query access to sums expressed in the ubiquitous language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each type of aggregate that needs global access, create a service that can provide the illusion of an in-memory collection of all objects of that aggregate’s root type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up access through a well-known global interface.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide methods to add and remove objects, encapsulating the actual insertion or removal of data in the data store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide methods that select objects based on criteria meaningful to domain experts. For example, return fully instantiated objects or collections of objects whose attribute values meet the requirements, thereby encapsulating the actual storage and query technology, or return proxies that give the illusion of fully instantiated aggregates lazily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide repositories only for aggregate roots that actually need direct access. Keep application logic focused on the model, delegating all object storage and access to the repositories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shift the responsibility for creating instances of complex objects and aggregates to a separate object, which may itself have no responsibility in the domain model but is still part of the domain design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an interface that encapsulates all complex assemblies and does not require the client to reference the concrete classes of the instantiated objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an entire aggregate as a piece, enforcing its invariants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create complex value objects like a piece, possibly after assembling the elements with a builder.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supple design complements the deep modelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client developer, who weaves the domain objects into the application code or other domain layer code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The client developer can flexibly use a minimal set of loosely coupled concepts to express a range of scenarios in the domain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effects of its code must be transparently obvious, so the consequences of a change will be easy to anticipate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making behaviour obvious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reduces the cost of change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;name classes and operations to describe their effect and purpose, without reference to how they do what they promise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This relieves the client developer of the need to understand the internals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These names should conform to the ubiquitous language so that team members can quickly infer their meaning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before creating it, write a test for behaviour to force your thinking into client developer mode.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;state post-conditions of operations and invariants of classes and aggregates with assertions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if assertions cannot be coded directly in your programming language, write automated unit tests for them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;where it fits, define a function whose return type is the same as its arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the implementer has a state used in the computation. The implementer is a compelling operation argument, so the argument(s) and the return value should be the same type as the implementer.???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Such an operation is closed under the set of instances of that type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A closed operation provides a high-level interface without introducing any dependency on other concepts.???&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;many of the benefits of the declarative design are obtained once you have combinable elements that communicate their meaning and have characterized or apparent effects or no observable effects at all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;decompose design elements (operations, interfaces, classes, and aggregates) into cohesive units, considering your intuition of the essential divisions in the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe the axes of change and stability through successive refactorings, and look for underlying conceptual contours that explain these shearing patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Align the model with the consistent aspects of the domain that make it a viable area of knowledge in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to plot strategy, we need a realistic, large-scale view of model development extending across our project and others we integrate with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify each model in play on the project and define its bounded context. This includes the implicit models of non-object-oriented subsystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name each bounded context, and make the names part of the ubiquitous language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe the point of contact between the models, outlining explicit translation for any communication. Highlighting any sharing, isolation mechanism, and levels of influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map the existing terrain. Take up the transformations later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when teams in two contexts succeed or fail together, a cooperative relationship often emerges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where development failure in either of two contexts would result in delivery failure for both, forging a partnership between the teams in charge of the two contexts. Institute a process for coordinated planning of development and joint management of integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The teams must cooperate on the evolution of their interface to accommodate the developments needs of both systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interdependent features should be scheduled to complete for the same release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharing a part of the model and associated code is a very intimate interdependency, which can leverage design work or undermine it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design with an explicit boundary some subset of the domain model that the teams agree to share. Keep this kernel small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within this boundary, include this subset of the model, the subset of code or the database design associated with that part of the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This explicitly shared stuff has a special status and shouldn’t be changed without consultation with the other team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When functional integration is limited, the overhead of continuous integration of a significant context may be deemed too high. This may especially be true when the team does not have the skill or the political organization to maintain continuous integration or when a single team is simply too big and unwieldy.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when 2 teams are in an upstream-downstream relationship, where the upstream team may succeed independently of the fate of the downstream team, the needs of the downstream come to be addressed in a variety of ways with a wide range of consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a clear customer/supplier relationship between the two teams, meaning downstream priorities factor into upstream planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiate and budget tasks for downstream requirements so that everyone understands the commitment and schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jointly developed automated acceptance tests and validate the expected interface from the upstream. Adding these tests to the upstream team’s test suite, to be run as part of its continuous integration, will free the upstream team to make changes without fear of downstream side effects.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;similar to customer/supplier, but the upstream has no motivation to provide for the downstream team’s need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to eliminate the complexity of translation between bounded contexts by slavishly adhering to the model of the upstream team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubiquitous language with your upstream team will be shared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altruism may be sufficient to get them to share information with you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translation becomes more complex when control or communication is insufficient to pull off a shared kernel, partner, or customer/supplier relationship. As a result, the translation takes on a more defensive tone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a downstream client, create an isolating layer to provide your system with the functionality of the upstream system in terms of your own domain model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This layer talks to the other system through its existing interface, requiring little or no modification to the other system. Internally, the layer translates in one or both directions as necessary between the two models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where integration is one-off, this approach of inserting a translation layer for each external system avoids corruption of the models with a minimum cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a protocol that gives access to your subsystem as a set of services. Then, open the protocol so that all who need to integrate with you can use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance and expand the protocol to handle new integration requirements, except when a single team has idiosyncratic needs. Then, use a one-off translator to augment the protocol for that particular case so what the shared protocol can stay coherent and straightforward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a subsystem has to be integrated with many others, customizing a translator for each can bog down the team. There is more and more to maintain and more and more to worry about when changes are made.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The translation between the models of two bounded contexts requires a common language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a well-documented shared language to express the necessary domain information as a common communication medium, translating as essential into and out of that language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published language is often combined with open-host service.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;declare a bounded context to have no connection to the others, allowing developers to find simple, specialized solutions within this small scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;well-defined context boundaries only emerge from intellectual choices and social forces (even though the people creating the systems may not always have been consciously aware of these causes at the time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw a boundary around the entire mess and designate it as a big ball of mud. Do not try to apply sophisticated modelling within this context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be alert to the tendency for such systems to sprawl into other contexts.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you focus on your central problem and keep from drowning in a sea of side issues?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distillation is the process of separating the components of a mixture to extract the essence in a form that makes it more valuable and useful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A model is a distillation of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to make a domain model an asset, the critical core of that model has to be sleek and fully leveraged to create application functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boil the model down. Define a core domain and provide a means of easily distinguishing it from the mass of supporting model and code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring the most valuable and specialized concepts into sharp relief. Make the core small.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply top talent to the core domain, and recruit accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend the effort in the core to find a deep model and develop a supple design - sufficient to fulfill the system’s vision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some parts of the model add complexity without capturing or communicating specialized knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify cohesive subdomains that are not the motivation for your project, factor out generic models of these subdomains and place them in separate modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave no trace of your specialties in them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once they have been separated, give their continuing development lower priority than the core domain, and avoid assigning your core developers to the tasks (because they will gain little domain knowledge from them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also, consider off-the-shelf solutions or published models for these generic subdomains.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the critical aspects of the domain model may span multiple bounded contexts, but by definition, these distinct models can’t be structured to show their common focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a short description (about one page) of the core domain and the value it will bring, the “value proposition.” ignore those aspects that do not distinguish this domain model from others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write this statement early and revise it as you gain new insight.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a domain vision statement identifies the core domain in broad terms, but it leaves the identification of the specific core model elements up to the vagaries of individual interpretation. Unless there is an exceptionally high level of communication on the team, the vision statement alone will have little impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mental labour of constantly filtering the model to identify the essential parts absorbs concentration better spent on design thinking, and it requires comprehensive knowledge of the model. Therefore, the core domain must be made easier to see.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write a brief document (3-7 sparse pages) describing the core domain and the primary interactions among core elements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flag the elements of the core domain within the primary repository of the model without particularly trying to elucidate its role. Make it effortless for a developer to know what is in or out of the core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the vision statement and highlighted core inform and guide, they do not modify the model or the code itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partitioning generic subdomains physically removes some distracting elements.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conceptual “what” is swamped by the mechanistic “how.” Many methods that provide algorithms for resolving the problem obscure the methods that express the problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partition a conceptually cohesive mechanism into a separate lightweight framework. Particularly watch for formalisms or well-documented categories of algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expose the capabilities of the framework with an intention-revealing interface.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other elements of the domain can focus on expressing the problem (“what”), delegating the intricacies of the solution (“how”) to the framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factoring out generic subdomains reduces clutter, and cohesive mechanisms serve to encapsulate complex operations. This leaves behind a more focused model, with fewer distractions that add no particular value to how users conduct their activities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are unlikely to find good homes for everything in the domain model that is not core.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;approach to structurally marking off the core domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor the model to separate the core concepts from supporting players (including ill-defined ones) and strengthen the cohesion of the core while reducing its coupling to other code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factor all generic or supporting elements into other objects and place them into different packages.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core domain model usually has so much detail that communicates the big picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the most fundamental differentiating concepts in the model and factor them into distinct classes, abstract classes, or interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design this abstract model to express most of the interaction between significant components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place this abstract model in its own module, while the specialized, detailed implementation classes are left in their own modules defined by the subdomain.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “large-scale structure” is a language that lets you discuss and understand the system in broad strokes. A set of high-level concepts or rules, or both, establishes a pattern of design for an entire system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devise a pattern of rules or roles and relationships that will span the entire system and allow some understanding of each part’s place in the whole-even without detailed knowledge of the part’s responsibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architectures can straitjacket a project with up-front design assumptions and take too much power away from the developers/designers of particular application parts. Soon, developers/designers of specific details of the applications will dumb down the application to fit the structure, or they will subvert it and have no structure, bringing back the problems of uncoordinated development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let this large-scale conceptual structure evolve with the application, possibly changing to a completely different type of structure along the way. Don’t constraint the detailed design and model decisions that must be made with thorough knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The large-scale structure should be applied when a structure can be found that dramatically clarifies the system without forcing unnatural constraints on model development. Because an ill-fitting structure is worse than none, it is best not to shoot for comprehensiveness but rather to find a minimal set that solves the emerging problem. Less is more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;software designs tend to be abstract and hard to grasp. Developers and users alike need tangible ways to understand the system and share a view of the system as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a concrete analogy to the system emerges that captures the imagination of team members and seems to lead thinking in a helpful direction, adopt it as a large-scale structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize the design around this metaphor and absorb it into the ubiquitous language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The system metaphor should facilitate communication about the system and guide the development. This increases consistency in different system parts, potentially even across different bounded contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because all metaphors are inexact, continually reexamine the metaphor for overextension or inaptness, and be ready to drop it if it gets in the way.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at the conceptual dependencies in your model and the varying rates and sources of change of different parts of your domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you identify natural strata in the domain, cast them as broad abstract responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These responsibilities should tell a story of your system’s high-level purpose and design.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactor the model so that the responsibilities of each domain object, aggregate, and module fit neatly within the responsibility of one layer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a group of objects that describe how another group of objects should behave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a distinct set of objects that can define and constrain the structure and behaviour of the basic model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep these concerns separate as 2 “levels,” one very concrete, the other reflecting rules and knowledge that a user or super-user can customize.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a pluggable component framework usually only comes into play after a few applications have already been implemented in the same domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distill an abstract core of interfaces and interactions and create a framework that allows diverse implementations of those interfaces to be freely substituted. Likewise, it will enable any application to use those components, so long as it operates strictly through the interfaces of the abstract core.&lt;/li&gt;

The developer who made it work walks away exhausted, successful on his terms, leaving the system even more complex than before.

&lt;p&gt;Design is intelligence made visible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People think that design is styling. Design is not style. It’s not about giving shape to the shell and not giving a damn about the guts. Good design is a renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need, and beauty to produce something that the world didn’t know it was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is intelligence made visible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Design is] a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is design? it’s where you stand with a foot in 2 worlds - the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes - and you try to bring the 2 together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design isn’t just to satisfy requirements, but also to uncover requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perfection is not reached when there is nothing to be added anymore, but when there is nothing to be left out anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the design process, at its best, integrates the aspirations of art, science, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to say that something is designed means it has intentions that go beyond its function. Otherwise, it’s just planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good design defuses the tension between functional and aesthetic goals precisely because it works within the boundaries defined by the functional requirements of communication problem. Unlike the fine arts, which exists for their own sake, design must always solve a particular real-world problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in practice, designing seems to proceed by oscillating between sub-solution and sub-problem areas, as well as decomposing the problem and combining sub-solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you specify something to be designed, tell what properties you need, not how they are to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the trick is to hold “process” off long enough to permit great design to occur, so that the lesser issues can be debated once the great design is on the table - rather than smothering it in the cradle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good design is good business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you think it’s expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all… good design must primarily serve people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point: design is inevitable. The alternative to good design is bad design, not no design at all. Everyone makes design decisions all the time without realizing it - like Moliere’s M. Jourdain who discovered he had been speaking prose all his life, and good design is simply the result of making these decisions consciously, at the right stage, and in consultation with others as the need arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a good design is not the one that correctly predicts the future, it’s one that makes adapting to the future affordable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we’ve probably designed 4000 products at IDEO over my career, and for every one of them I’d like to send a little note with it that says, “I’m sorry that it’s in this present state. Given what I know now, if I could start over again it would be a lot better”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is easy. All you do is stare at the screen until drops of blood form on your forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ease of use and ease of learning are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;computer design is often bad design done on a computer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our opportunity as designers, is to learn how to handle the complexity, rather than shy away from it, and to realize that the big art of design is to make complicated things simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no, Watson, this was not done by accident, but by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design is about making things good (and then better) and right (and fantastic) for the people who use and encounter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never design a building before I’ve seen the site and met the people who will be using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the only important thing about design is how it relates to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a design isn’t finished until somebody is using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;still under constructions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;over past decades, the economy has moved away from brute force labor to analyzing and applying information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ability to do deep work will determine how much you thrive in the information economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;idea-1-deep-work-is-important&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#idea-1-deep-work-is-important&quot; aria-label=&quot;idea 1 deep work is important permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Idea 1 Deep work is important&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn and master new skills
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;technology and best practices become obsolete quickly in the information economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;determine if your goal is attainable and ensure that the skill is relevant to your career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a method that aligns with your learning style and allows you to take on the skill bit by bit, instead of all at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rely on others, find a mentor who can coach you and help you reflect on your progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the skills to increase your output
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high-quality work produced = time spent * intensity of focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what you do with your skill must be useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;efficient, productivity for the sake of increasing output that’s not necessarily useful or high-quality.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in three major ways that modern workplaces derail knowledge workers’ ability to engage in deep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-floor-plans&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#open-floor-plans&quot; aria-label=&quot;open floor plans permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;open floor plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuously distracting environment, where every conversation is heard and one person can disrupt dozens of people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pandemic highlighted the heightened risk of disease transmission in open shared spaces and accelerated their decision to leave the open floor plans behind.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;instant-communication&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#instant-communication&quot; aria-label=&quot;instant communication permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;instant communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with instant messaging tools like Slack and texting, people can interrupt your work on-demand. As a result, we stop being deep thinkers and become human network routers. We could use the platform’s features to notify senders that you won’t be responding immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#social-media&quot; aria-label=&quot;social media permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;social media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the new content you see always seems novel and productive, but it doesn’t move you closer to the major things you really care about. The addictive quality of social media is due to our attraction to variable rewards: rewards that happen at random times, rather than in a predictable pattern. You can’t predict which refresh of your newsfeed will reward you with interesting information or likes, so the action never loses its appeal.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deep work actually moves you meaningfully toward happiness and fulfillment. Deep work is when you’re most capable of tackling your thorniest problems. Because these problems often yield the largest rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when people concentrate on a worthwhile task that pushes them to their cognitive limit, they experience a state of flow or a sense of contentment and purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s more effective to approach deep work with structure, habit, and discipline. In other words, to make deep work a practiced ritual. It becomes a habit, you no longer have to employ your willpower to overcome distractions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;schedule-type-1-seclusion&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#schedule-type-1-seclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;schedule type 1 seclusion permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Schedule Type 1: Seclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove as many shallow work tasks from your life as possible. Spend nearly all your time on deep work. For example, some authors go off the grid and aren’t reachable by email or through social media. All correspondence comes in by postal mail or through their editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid all shallow tasks, you will have to learn the essential skill of delegation. “Who can I delegate my shallow work to?”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carve out regular periods each week, month, or entire parts of the year to focus on deep work. The period should be at least one full day to reach the maximum intensity of deep work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working from home at least one day per week, and planning to do your most mentally demanding tasks in this isolated, focused time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set aside a regular block of time each day to focus on deep work. For example, set aside the morning (such as 8-11 a.m.) for deep work, before jumping into shallow work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the most productive part of your day is the hour right after you wake up because you’re re-charged and the world is relatively quiet and distraction-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find some time to do deep work whenever you can get it. For example, when on a trip with your family, carve out a few hours to do work before joining them for activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it requires the ability to switch on deep work instantaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much deep work should you try to fit into your day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is a limit to how much deep work you’ll be able to accomplish per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experts who have extensive practice can expand to up to four hours, but rarely are able to exceed this.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schedule in advance when you’ll use the internet. avoid it completely outside these times.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep a note bad nearby where you record the next time you’re scheduled to use the internet, and any ideas you need to revisit once you’re online again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan your work so you don’t need the internet to make progress. If you get stuck by not being able to access the internet, then move on to another task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you must use the internet all day, try using website blocking apps like forest/self-control to help remove the temptation to switch your attention away from deep work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan your tasks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan out everything that you need to do throughout the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use podomoro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quantify depth
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your day is full of shallow tasks, you should consider replacing those with deeper work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reflect on and tweak your schedule
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the accuracy of your time blocks at the end of each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you may feel discouraged if you aren’t able to follow your schedule or give in to distraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this feeling is indistractable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s essential to think of your schedule as an evolving experiment that you probably won’t get right on the first try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of ways to build a schedule better aligned with your need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give yourself intense deadlines that will force you to concentrate to the limit of your ability. Then cut down the time drastically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deadlines create a moderate amount of emotional arousal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coderetreat is a day dedicated to allowing developers time to practice their craft. The focus is on practicing skills like Test-Driven Development (TDD), refactoring, and incremental design that is proven to make developers move faster with fewer bugs. It is designed to enable participants to focus on their practice, with as few distractions as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day is made up of several short sessions where we either work in pairs or mobs to solve a small coding problem. Each session, we start new with the same problem; this allows us to focus on the new skill we are learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coderetreat is an excellent place to learn what you know and what you don’t know. As in life in general, there are always new people to meet, new things to learn, and new ways of working and playing together, whether it be with code or ideas. They create a space where we can try out things that we have always wanted to try out, but we’ve never had time to try. Coderetreat is about peer learning, it can be hard to step outside of your comfort zone but together with other people, it is easy and even fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to mean to practice. You’ve probably been meaning to practice already. Meeting together gives you a chance to actually do it. When we work in a pair or group, we are able to exchange new approaches and ideas and keep each other honest about actually using best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

(it’s not that I complain about it as a matter of fact I love it every single second and I’m amazed at how much I have learned from the community)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been asking myself, what’s the simpler way for me to learn to refactor and share with others? (why refactor, you may ask? it’s because it’s my favourite topic in the long never-ending list of agile technical practices) and for some reason, I really like to share my boring meme jokes, so I guess why not share a list of animated gifs of refactoring and the motivation of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess since I’m an Asian guy (hopefully some kind of descendants from Bruce Lee) so this saying is pretty cool to me:
&lt;strong&gt;“I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 different kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbrains&quot;&gt;J.B Rainsberger&lt;/a&gt;, “I can see one large issue: programmers do not allow the various refactoring patterns to become so easy/comfortable that their fingers can &lt;strong&gt;execute them without conscious thought. This interferes with their progress because they have to switch more often among the questions “which refactorings will improve this design?” and “how do I perform this micro-step?”&lt;/strong&gt; if they don’t become able to perform the micro-steps (a sequence of 3-7 nano steps) easily, they might not breakthrough from “I know how to safely lead the design where I want it to go” to the more powerful &lt;strong&gt;“I can just start removing duplication and improving names and a good design will emerge”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong: the first of these 2 outcomes are good, but the second of these two outcomes is much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the consequences, of never breaking through is that the programmer &lt;strong&gt;will miss out on finding helpful designs that are simpler than the ones that their intuition can see.”&lt;/strong&gt; Damn, I can smell/see big FOMO emotions running through me now!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and as a matter of fact, there are so many moves in refactoring, so I’m curious if I could just distill most of the refactoring moves in under 10 moves (like there’s are 10 basic numbers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so the game plan for this article is to post as many refactoring moves/snippets as possible but then distill them and reduce them to under &lt;strong&gt;10 refactoring snippets&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to copy this and make your own top 10 moves, I would be definitely interested in seeing a different list of top 10 refactoring moves so I can improve my list better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here goes the list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separate the intention and implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put a name to the block of code (“Naming as a Process” from Arlo)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If we can give it a name, we can control it”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to keep class and method names to 1-2 words, and avoid names that duplicate the context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Naming as a process” provides a good heuristic for naming but it’s too freaking long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Provide safety nets for doing refactoring by leveraging Standard IO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a quick way to provide test coverage without knowing much about the underlying code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would probably be more tedious to mock out external/IO/Database call in the code.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several important points that I need to write down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the main reason for me to do code retreat to help developers in the community to expose more to TDD/craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I asked myself the question: “How come it’s not easy to adapt TDD, automated testing which should be the core value of any efficient team?” I don’t think that people is lazy or people is resistant, I think as the industry, there’s lots of ambiguity in how people should approach TDD (SOLID principles, 4 simple rules of design, etc … are too generic) and agile practices (agile manifesto, etc…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I apply SOLID, 4 simple rules of design into my day to day jobs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the most important reasons for developers to write automated tests? is it testability design, is it executable documentations?….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what’s the different between integration/component/API tests? should we care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when I discuss unit tests with QA, typical answers I get is that it’s programmer tests? IT’S SO NOT TRUE? It does contain many behaviors of the systems, some behaviors are at very low level and business people shouldn’t care about, but I believe &lt;strong&gt;MOST OF THE BEHAVIORS&lt;/strong&gt; could and should be expressed at &lt;strong&gt;high level domain language&lt;/strong&gt; and can be used as &lt;strong&gt;executable documentation&lt;/strong&gt; for different stakeholders such as QA/Non technical people. Should we call those tests as behavior unit tests instead of unit tests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we make the TDD/Refactor/agile practices easier for people to adapt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, &lt;strong&gt;shrink the change?&lt;/strong&gt;
Maybe, there’s lots of things can go wrong but there’s few things that you got to get it right, so &lt;strong&gt;script critical moves?&lt;/strong&gt;
Maybe, Looking for bright spot (examples) so people can see the benefits and &lt;strong&gt;start small?&lt;/strong&gt;
Maybe, &lt;strong&gt;tweak the environments&lt;/strong&gt; to encourage the right behavior and discourage the wrong behavior?
I think code retreat is one of the good place for me to find the answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yet another interpretation of pyramid tests]]></title><description><![CDATA[In recent conversations regarding automating tests, It seems to me that the common understanding of the team is that the only acceptable…]]></description><link>https://tonytvo.github.io/yet-another-interpretation-pyramid-tests/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tonytvo.github.io/yet-another-interpretation-pyramid-tests/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent conversations regarding automating tests, It seems to me that the common understanding of the team is that the only acceptable automated test case is through the workflow tests through the UI. As far as I know, that’s not entirely correct and per “Pyramids of Automation” chapter 15 in More Agile Testing, I think there are lots of different ways we can automate test cases. I would like to take the opportunity to describe the pyramids of automation again with some thoughts/questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me try to describe the original pyramid again, and here’s the picture that is worth thousands of words&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the above pyramid from Mike Cohn with some modification in “More Agile Testing”, the lowest level, the unit tests, gets the fastest feedback on every commit which would provide the most benefits. &lt;strong&gt;The higher the tests located in the pyramid texts, the slower the feedback and lower profit we would get from the automated tests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The test automation pyramid is a model intended to guide teams in getting the most value from their test automation for the minimum investment and with the least overlap/duplication between each pyramid level.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s expand the above pyramid with some specific tools/context for our team&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the expanded pyramid tests, we can see that we need to leverage different tools and techniques to do different automated testings at different levels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the above pyramids tests, I think there’s still 1 missing piece in the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to How to implement UI Testing without shooting yourselves in the foot, in order to avoid maintenance costs of UI tests, a very good idea when designing UI level functional tests is to think about describing the UI test and the automation at these 3 different levels:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The stability in acceptance tests comes from the fact that business rules don’t change as much as technical implementations”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology moves much faster than business. &lt;strong&gt;The closer your acceptance tests are to the business rules, the more stable they are and the more clearer it is to the entire team (QA, Dev, PdM, etc…) on what the systems, products suppose to behave&lt;/strong&gt;. The acceptance tests could be written in the form of unit tests, integration tests, UI tests, etc… The team usually would decide if they could automate the acceptance criteria and at what test level they want to automate the acceptance criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the problems we often encountered with integration, UI tests are slowness in getting the feedback, hard to diagnose the problems when the tests fail (especially performance tests), flaky tests, etc… As a result, I feel that &lt;strong&gt;the more acceptance tests could be written in the form of unit behavior tests, the better alignment between the code and the business domain/behavior. This could lead to other benefits such as ubiquitous language for the entire team and design test-ability for the system/product and the better design skills of the team working in the system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on all of the above information, I ask myself, “should we call unit tests as behavior unit tests instead of units tests?”. Yes there is some behavior that is at such a low level that people don’t care about, but there are LOTS of behavior unit tests that in HIGH LEVEL that different stakeholders SHOULD know about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague (David) summarizes this article in the following key points and I couldn’t find a better way to put it together and here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we move our conversation around test to business rules we will all have more clarity and will decouple our conversations from the details. We will gain stability (because our terms don’t - change with the technical details) and clarity because we focus on the actual goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking at the business rule level allows us to determine if that business rule can be tested at a level lower than the UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some business rules can be tested at the unit test level, in which case we should adopt the term behavioral unit test to help people comprehend that those tests are actually testing business rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

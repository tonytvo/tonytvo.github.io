<p>Our kids have our virtues and our vices. That’s what makes this whole crazy parenting thing such a wonderful opportunity. Because we are here to help them become the best possible versions of themselves. One of the ways we do that is to help them become like us in all the good ways. But one of the other ways is to prevent them from becoming too much like us in all the bad ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can be an incredibly difficult balancing act if we aren’t honest or self-possessed, if we let our egos get in the way. We can’t let that happen. This is our chance, our time! To help them. To bolster them. To help them overcome flaws that maybe we never quite got over ourselves.</p>

<p>“The idea of childhood is one of the great inventions of the Renaissance,” he writes, because it allowed children to develop, to learn, to have a safe space to play and explore and discover themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like any invention, childhood can disappear. How? With the disappearance of adulthood. Childhood, as both a social structure and a</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>psychological condition, works when things like maturity, responsibility, literacy, and critical thinking mark an adult. But when things like long-form writing and reading decline, the gap between child and adult shrinks; the line between them blurs and then dissolves.</p>
<ul>
<li>As parents, we have to protect this great invention. We have to increase the gap between childhood and adulthood. Let them be kids… but also make sure that you are being an adult. Be a leader. Be responsible. Be an example,</li>
</ul>
<p>a model they have to strive toward. Let them see you with a book they can’t yet comprehend. Let them be around adult conversations they can’t quite understand. Let them see you working and sweating and providing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let them see an adult—so they have something not just to look up to but to look forward to as well.</li>

<p>What were the things that Marcus learned from Antoninus? He learned the importance of compassion, hard work, persistence, altruism, self-reliance, cheerfulness; keeping an open mind and listening to anyone who could contribute; taking responsibility and blame, and putting other people at ease; yielding the floor to experts and heeding their advice; knowing when to push something or someone and when to back off; being indifferent to superficial honors and treating people as they <em><strong>deserved to be treated.</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s quite a list, isn’t it? These lessons impacted Marcus so deeply, he remembered them far into adulthood and recorded them for his own reference in what would become Meditations. What made the lessons so powerful was that they were <em>embodied</em> in Antoninus’s actions rather than written on some tablet or scroll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no better way to learn than from a role model. There is no better way to judge our progress than in constant company with the person we would most like to be one day.</p>

And they did it in the smallest of ways—with just a few conversations, with how they went to work every day, with the books they read in the evening and the manners they displayed at dinner. They did it in the conversations they had when their kids made mistakes. They did it in how they treated their neighbors and mowed their lawns and plowed their driveways.</p>

<p>It was a comment under your breath about your brother’s spending habits. It was a joke about a celebrity’s weight. It was a complaint about the way your neighbor parks in their driveway. It was the conversation between you and your spouse over dinner about what’s wrong with the other side, with them.</p>

<p>You didn’t mean anything by it. You don’t really care. But your kids heard it. And they can read only your lips, not your mind.</p>

You would never say something cruel to someone’s face, so why are you saying it behind their back? Especially when your kids can hear you.</p>

<p>Well, if you want your kids to respect you, be worthy of respect.</p>

Why would they look up to you when you yourself are dealing (poorly) with self-esteem issues, when you have accepted the lies of impostor syndrome and allowed them to affect how you act as a parent?</p>

</ul>
<p>opposite, that parents would be allowed to sit out a potential suicide mission - but that’s not how it worked in Sparta. These warriors were chosen because parents would never want to let their kids down. These fathers would fight most bravely, most fiercely, not only to protect what they had back at home but to protect the reputations of their family names, which might be all their children had left if they were to fall in battle. To abandon their comrades or behave in a cowardly way would be to risk great shame and the possibility of letting down the family that so looked up to them.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>your kids shrug when you say it. It feels weird saying it in public - cliché, lame, vulnerable. You don’t want to embarrass them. Or bother them. Or interrupt. Plus, they know how you feel, right? You’ve said it a thousand times before at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a million reasons not to say these words, but all of these reasons are wrong because it’s impossible to say them enough:</p>
<ul>
<li>I love you.</li>
<li>I’m proud of you.</li>
<li>It’s you I like.</li>
<li>You are special.</li>
<li>You are enough.</li>
<li>You’re the most important thing in the world to me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of your life, do you think, for one second, that you will kick yourself for saying any of those words too much? Or is it more likely that you’ll wish you’d said those things more? Because it would absolutely kill you if you thought for one second that they might not know, that they might not feel in their hearts, how much you loved them, how proud you were of them, how nothing—not success, money, or lack of either—could change what they meant to you from the moment they were born.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life is full of risks. This is one gamble you don’t need to take. So say it. Tell them how you feel. Tell them that you love them. Say it again and again and again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s impossible to do it too much… but you might as well try.</p>
</li>

Amen.</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parental love is not something that is dispensed only when things are going easily with your kids. When they listen. When they conform to your expectations. Expressions of love are not just for when they succeed or when everything is going well in your life or in your job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not every now and then but always. Without end. Unconditionally. Even when they hit their siblings, when they lie about a test, when they don’t want to eat their vegetables, when they want to quit something you paid a lot of money for, when they’ve acted in a way contrary to the values you’ve tried to instill in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if this kind of love isn’t something you got as a kid. Even if it seems clouded when you’re struggling or difficult to express when you’re pissed off. Even when they take you for granted and make things so hard on you, you have to show them that you love them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>It’s a love without end, amen.</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Parenting is being there, literally. It’s about being of service, literally. Driving them around. Tying their shoes. Coming over to do the dishes and laundry after they’ve come home from the hospital with their own newborn. Holding their hair back as they throw up from chemo treatments. It doesn’t matter how old they are, or you are; that’s what we’re here for. That’s what we do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We ask them the question that Tom Hanks has described asking his own children: “ ‘What do you need me to do?’ You offer up that to them. ‘I will do anything I can possibly do in order to keep you safe.’ That’s it. Offer that up and then just love them.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is love. It’s what your job is. You’re here to serve.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s a sobering reminder to all parents: the feeling of deficiency is far worse than any potential deprivation. So make sure your kids know that they are enough, that they are plenty, that you have loved them from the moment they were born. And make sure you remember that there is nothing they have to do to earn this love. There’s nothing they must accomplish to deserve tenderness and affection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are good enough. The talents, the interests, the goals they have, are enough.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>So often important and talented people use their work and their talent as an excuse to neglect their obligations as parents. But di Prima was exactly right to see them both as a matter of discipline and commitment. The idea that anything (or anyone) is improved by neglecting one part of their life for another is nonsense. But the opposite is true—by keeping your word to yourself, to your children, you are strengthening an important muscle. By being disciplined and protective of your personal life, you are being protective and dedicated to your professional life.</p>

<p>Don’t let anyone tell you differently. Don’t let anyone judge you for that.</p>

<p>Our kids don’t owe us anything. After all, they didn’t ask to be here. It is we who are obligated to them, by virtue of our choice to bring them into this world.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You want your kids to really listen, to buy in. You want them around, you want them to come to you. You want them to respect your rules and embody your values. You want them to do what they’re supposed to do, the things that will make them successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>So how do you get them to do those things?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, for most parents, the answer is to default to the easiest and most primal form of leadership: force. It’s got a simple logic to it. You make them do it - *because I’m bigger than you, because I can take away the TV remote,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>because I said so*. And it seems like it works… for a while. Perhaps you remember how this worked from your own childhood. Eventually, the strategy falls apart over time. In the end, it turns out to be counterproductive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay. Then listen to Lincoln. “Love is the chain whereby to bind a child to its parent.”</li>

<li>You’re raw because having kids has opened you up. “I wasn’t emotionally prepared for parenthood,” the comedian and author Michael Ian Black writes, “after spending the thirty previous years in a cauterized emotional state.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Parenthood forces you to engage the world in a more active way. It forces you to engage with yourself and your own emotions in an active way. Was it easier to go through the world closed off and cynical? Is there something tribal and reassuring about focusing on yourself and your problems and
placing the blame for those things elsewhere, on those other people?</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course. But that’s less and less possible these days. This parenting thing has changed you. It’s made you see that it’s all connected, that we’re all connected. It’s made you better.</li>

<p>If there were a list of things you never wanted your kids to think or feel, those responses—which Jessica says get emailed to her almost every day—are probably right at the top of the list. No kid should feel like their dad wants them to be someone else, to be something different. No kid should feel that they are a disappointment. They should know that they are special for who they are, that they make the world—and your life - better just by being in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your kids need to be seen. They need to be heard. They need to be loved. They need to be known. For who they are, for what they choose to be. Not for who or what you want them to become.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s all they really want from us. And they deserve to have it. So you better give it to them. Starting today and for the rest of their lives.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The good news is that there are some things you can always give them that, when others try to offer them to your kids, will never measure up to yours. These are things that are always possible to give, always within your reach: your attention, your understanding, and your love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No matter what happens, no matter how rich or poor you are, no matter what mistakes you make or they make, no matter how powerful or powerless you are, you can always give them those things. In fact, you must always give</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>them. Because, in the end, those are more important than all the other things you can and will do for them. Love and understanding, especially, are the only things that truly matter, because they last even beyond your death. Their
impact is going to be one of the primary forces that shape the adult your child becomes.</p>
<ul>

<li>The best thing you can do for your kids is love the person who brought them into this world. The best thing you can do for your kids is love the person you are parenting them with.

You must love who your kids love—that’s how they’ll know that they are loved.</li>

<p>Every family, every person, has a different main thing, of course. But if we could generalize, the main thing for us parents is to <strong>raise well-adjusted, self-reliant, decent, happy kids.</strong> <em><strong>The main thing is not college. The main thing is not making partner at our law firm. The main thing is not to have a clean house. The main thing is not to win some competition with other parents.

<li>
<p><em><strong>The main thing is for them to be healthy, to be prepared for life, to have good values, to have a good sense of who they are and what they want to spend their life doing. The main, main, main, main thing is to love them and for them to feel loved.</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li>So here’s a question: When they screw up, when they fail a test, when they crash their car, when they get in trouble, when they talk back to you, why do you assume the worst? Why do you treat them with anger and judgment? Why do you jump all over them with criticism or frustration or</li>
</ul>
<p>suspicion?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You know they are good and decent. You know they generally do their best. You know what they struggle with. You know their fears and vulnerabilities and weaknesses. You know what they’ve been through (deep down, you know one of the things they’ve been through is being raised by you!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So why isn’t that being reflected in your tone? In your assumptions? Where is the kindness? Where is the good faith? Why aren’t you talking to them like someone who believes in them, who is a fan of them? Where is the</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>patience? Where is the charity? Where is the demonstrable unconditionalness that you purport to have for them?</p>
<ul>
<li>Mm-hm. That’s right. Oh, and remember, all this could be said about your interactions with your spouse too.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>everyone remembers the “rich kids” growing up. Even rich kids remember the other richer kids. We envied their ski trips, their huge houses, their equally big vacation houses, their electronics, their clothes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And yet how many of those kids, when we look at them now, as adults, appear to have actually been quite poor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At home they faced a poverty of attention. A deficit of happiness or stability. Maybe their parents fought all the time. Maybe they worked constantly. Maybe they played favorites and none were their kids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As adults, we now realize that to be rich is not necessarily to be wealthy, especially as “wealth” comes in many forms. This is really good news. All of us have the ability to give our kids a rich life. We can measure wealth in the time and attention they get from us. By whether they feel safe and secure, whether their house feels like a home. Even if we only make $30,000 a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can make your kid the richest kid in the whole school without spending a dollar.</p>

Because there is no one on the planet with their same combination of DNA and experiences and circumstances.

<p>This thing is hard. Really hard. There are dark moments. There are moments when you’re convinced you have no idea what you’re doing and you think you’re the absolute worst. There are moments when you’ll be told you are in fact the worst. But you have to keep going. You can’t give up. You</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>the one thing about parenting is that it gives you second chances. It gives you a lot of leap days. Kids forget. They need you for something else. There are lots of tough conversations. Dinner happens every night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While you cannot undo what has been done, you can choose to take these second chances as they come. You can will yourself to play, even though you’re exhausted. You can stop yourself before getting upset this time, reminding yourself that you love the boy and that he’s still figuring things out. You can put the phone in a drawer and actually be there for the family meal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don’t get to do this forever. Tomorrow is never guaranteed. Today is a gift, a fluke (especially on a leap year). That’s why each interaction we have with our kids matters, why we can’t take it for granted. Still, we’re not going to get it right every time. So when we’re lucky enough to get another go? We better take advantage of it. We better try harder. We better show up.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Work, family, scene. Pick two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can party it up and hang on to a relationship, but you won’t have much time left for work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can grind away at your craft, be the toast of the scene, but what will that leave for your family?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re as committed to the work as you are to a happy home, you will have no room for anything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’d be wonderful if you could have the run of all these things all the time… but you can’t. Being a parent is about making trade-offs, from the</p>

<p>very second our kids enter this world: it’s their needs versus our wants. At first, it can be a shock to the system. But once we know what to say no to, and we know why, we can say yes with comfort and confidence to the things that matter. To the things that last.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Charles de Gaulle helped save France. Then he ran it. Yet even at the height of his power, he tried to always remind himself, “The presidency is temporary, family is permanent.” Accordingly, he put up boundaries between his personal and professional lives. He carved out private time. He refused to neglect the children who depended on him so much, particularly his mentally disabled daughter, Anne.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can’t ever let ourselves forget: we may be very important to the world, but to a small group of people to whom we are related, we are the whole</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>world. Nothing matters more than family, and  nothing is more permanent… until it isn’t. You can lose family. You can break your family. You can drive your family away. And then it is their loss that becomes permanent.</p>
<ul>
<li>By all means, pursue your success. Realize your ambition. Just make sure it’s not coming at the expense of what actually matters.</li>

</ul>
<p>important. How do you fit it all in?</p>
<ul>
<li>The truth is, if you’re winging it every day, you won’t get it all in. Something will fall by the wayside, and too often, it’s the time with our kids that is the first to go. Because we can turn on the TV. Because we can strap</li>

<p>them in the car seat and bring them along on errands. Because we can tell them, “Sorry, kiddo. I’m busy right now.”</p>

<li>
<p>This is why it can be a good idea to have very specific, scheduled time. So you can be sure that they have their time. Nonnegotiable time. Just as you do with work or anything else that matters to you.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Each day of our lives we make deposits into the memory banks of our children.</em> - CHARLES R. SWINDOLL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think of your own childhood. What do you remember? Is it those big moments? You know, the planned ones. The ones on the calendar. Is it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>exclusively Christmas mornings? The annual spring break vacations? The Fourth of July barbecue?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Or are your memories much more mundane?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What we remember about growing up are the little moments. We remember sitting in the passenger seat next to Dad on a long drive. We remember going for pizza after tennis practice. We remember waking up</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>from a nap and coming downstairs and watching a football game. We remember that little piece of advice. We remember thinking they were going
to be mad at us for something and getting a hug instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Similarly, the wounds that we feel often come from other small moments. The feeling of being ignored. Getting yelled at for leaving our shoes in the living room. The time that Mom didn’t stand up for us. The unspoken tension in the living room between our parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today you’ll be making plenty of these small deposits in their memory banks. How do you want that ledger to read?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no job, no career, no amount of responsibility that justifies being absent from the lives of your children. Being important, having a calling, achieving success, is great. But being important doesn’t change what your most important job is: being a parent. Being there for them. Becoming world class at being Mom or Dad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because when your days in the spotlight are over, when your fame and import have receded, you will still be a parent and your kids will still need you for the things kids have always needed their parents for.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As Theodore Roosevelt explained:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="language-text">There are many kinds of success in life worth having. It is exceedingly interesting and attractive to be a successful businessman, or railway man, or farmer, or a successful lawyer or doctor; or a writer, or a President, or a  ranchman, or the colonel of a fighting regiment, or to kill grizzly bears and lions. But for unflagging interest and enjoyment, a household of children, if things go reasonably well, certainly makes all other forms of success and achievement lose their importance by comparison.</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We still want to be good at our jobs, of course. We want to win championships or land big clients. We want recognition and we want the thrill of the chase. But we know now—because we’ve felt it—how small these things seem compared to a quiet evening at home. A Sunday in thepark. Breakfast full of laughter.

<ul>
<li>
<p>The biggest change that comes from having a kid isn’t financial—it’s not the sleep deprivation, it’s not even needing to take care of another person or the stress it puts on your  relationships. It’s that it rudely introduces you to the unavoidable reality that you are no longer the center of your own world - something you had been, despite what you thought, utterly ignorant of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an adult, you did what you wanted. Things operated on normal timelines. You made decisions and commitments and that was it. The world was logical and in your control. But now and for the rest of your life, reality is different. What time are you going to get to the party? When your daughter wakes up from her nap, that’s when. They’re sick with the flu? You’re sick with the flu. They feel like having a tough morning or are reeling from teenage hormones? Looks like you are too! Unavoidable reality means that you’re not in control. It means you’re going to sit and play in the sandbox for the next ninety minutes because God knows you’re not going to risk a tantrum. Unavoidable reality is weekends of soccer games and evenings of school plays and carpooling and school pickups. It means you can’t just skip dinner or grab something on the go—life doesn’t work that way anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s who you are now. That is the unavoidable reality. And guess what?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s wonderful. Get used to it.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>how do you get through to your kids? How do you show them what’s right? How can you make sure they know how much you care about them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The answer is simple: you can be there. A lot. There is a joke that the word love is actually spelled T-I-M-E. It’s true. Your kids won’t have to</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>wonder, they won’t need to ask—you, or your  partner, or other people - how you feel about them if you are constantly there to show them. <em>If you have prioritized your time with them over everything else.</em> Being there also alleviates the pressure to “find the words” in those trying moments, because you’ve been having an ongoing, regular conversation with your kids the
whole time. <em>The words are there.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>But being a great parent is not just about those pivotal moments. It’s not just providing for them or getting them into a great school so they can get</li>
</ul>
<p>ahead in life. It is mainly, and mostly, the day-to-day T-I-M-E. It’s the modeling, each day, of what being a good person looks like. It’s the showing, each time you see them, that you care, that they’re important, that they are
loved.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s about being there. A lot.</li>

<li>Kobe replied the requests to be on the news:</li>
</ul>
<p>“Can’t right now. My girls are keeping me busy. Hit me up in a couple of weeks.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you have the discipline to send a message like that? How strong are you at putting your family first? How good are your defenses against the endless requests, opportunities, impositions, and obligations that come with your work in particular and with life in general? It’s so easy to let people steal your time, to let them take you away from the thing that is keeping you busy: your kids, your family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe Bryant, tragically, will not get any more time with his kids, and they will not get any more time with him. Which is what makes that text he sent such a powerful reminder - a final feat of performance left there to inspire those of us continuing in the shadow of his death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put your family first. Put your kids first. Say that you’re too busy. Politely decline. You have other priorities.</p>

<li>We think we’re so important. We think our</li>
</ul>
<p>work is so important. In fact, that’s what we tell ourselves - that we work those long hours to make the money to provide them a certain kind of life. In fact, our kids’ needs are so humble. Mostly what they want is us. And beyond that? They’re pretty content with snacks. The occasional video game. A sprinkler to play in. Some magnet you picked up at the airport on the way home from a business trip. A parent who doesn’t yell at them all the time. They’re pretty easily impressed. Their needs are small.</p>

<p>at an event for female judges in the 1980s, during Sandra Day O’Connor’s term as the first female Supreme Court justice, a law professor asked, “How do you take care of your family and have a career?” O’Connor answered: “Always put your family first.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indeed, later in life, O’Connor would talk about how “desperately hard” it was to balance work and family. She would try to talk to her law clerks, male and female, about this struggle. She didn’t dance around how hard would it be. She shared what she had learned. And most important, in being up front, she provided them, and now us, the relief of knowing: it’s not possible without struggle.</p>

<p>It’s not true that money will guarantee your kids a good life. It’s not true that it will prevent them from feeling pain or loss. It’s not true that money is even high on their list of needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kids actually want is you. What kids actually need is you. As Dear Abby quite brilliantly put it in a column back in the 1950s, “If you want your children to turn out well, spend twice as much time with them, and half as much money.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can’t pay someone to be there for your kids. You can’t pay someone to do the job only you can do. Sure, money can make things easier; it can buy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>childcare and tutors. But it will never be as important as what you can provide by being hands on, by being a good example, by showing them you
care for them and value them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The proof of this? Just think about how many great people turned out just fine without much money at all.</li>

<ul>
<li>Our job is to raise great kids. Or, more precisely, our job is to raise great adults. The time we spend with our kids—whether it’s homeschooling or watching a TV show on the couch—is not a distraction from our work. It is</li>
</ul>
<p>the work. Really important work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who could really view their life as successful if they were famous but their kids were  struggling? Who would be truly happy accepting a Nobel Prize knowing that they had failed as a parent? What good would a billion dollars be if all the money in the world can’t convince your kids to come home for the holidays?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s why kids can never “take away” from our careers or “hold us back.” It’s not possible for them to interrupt our work… because they are</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>our work.</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="language-text">People who know my background and where I came from, and things like that, I didn’t really have my pops in my life. I never really had a real father figure besides coaches as I got older. This is my opportunity to be there for my daughter. I was hoping she could be there watching this season, but clearly she wasn’t going to be able to do that. I felt like it was important to just spend this year with her, and get back to it next year. Football is going to be there at the end of the day.</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lee was putting his family first. He was doing something his father didn’t do for him. He was drawing a line. He was deciding not to waste the most precious thing we have with our children: time. Each of us must decide the same.</p>

<li>
<p>We will not be perfect as parents. We will make mistakes. But we must do our best to avoid inspiring that painful question: Why didn’t you make time for me? Because there is no good answer for it. And the rationalizing answer they come up with has the potential to mess with their minds and redouble the damage of our absence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your kids don’t care that you’re president. They don’t care that this is the busy sales season. They don’t care that your own parents were sick. They don’t care that you were fighting over custody. They just care that you weren’t there.</p>

<ul>
<li>In an interview with Marc Maron, Sean explained that on an almost daily basis, someone will come up to him and say something to the effect of “You</li>
</ul>
<p>have no idea what your dad meant to me” or “You can’t understand how important your dad’s music is to me.”</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a strange claim, Sean explained, because of course he understands. John Lennon and his music are even more important in Sean’s life. Because</li>
</ul>
<p>John Lennon was Sean’s father. Because he has been holding on to that relationship every minute since his father was taken from him. Because John’s music is the only way he gets to talk to his son anymore.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each parent should take to heart what that means: even the greatest musician of all time is more important as a parent to his children than he is as an artist to the world. It doesn’t matter how great our work is, how wealthy it makes us, or what it ends up meaning to billions of people—nothing will eclipse the impact we have on our kids.</li>

<ul>
<li>For most of history, it’s been women who have felt the tension of these conflicting desires the most and have been forced to choose one over the</li>
</ul>
<p>other. Fathers, on the other hand, have been encouraged—expected even - to look outside the home for fulfillment and recognition, because for men professional success was good parenting.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As society has evolved, however, every parent has had to manage the tension of serving two masters, even prime ministers and billionaires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In her autobiography, Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to be UK prime minister, quotes Irene Ward, a pioneering British politician: “While the home</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>must always be the centre of one’s life, it should not be the boundary of one’s ambition.”</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re allowed to think bigger. It’s okay to have a career and want to be great at it. It’s okay to strive to change the world. Because in these things, as long as you share them and open them up to a wider view, you are teaching your kids about you and about the world. You are teaching them about hardwork, about doing what’s right, about fulfilling one’s potential, about being of use to others.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s not that hard, Ocean tells him; <em>you just have to be comfortable making less money.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we’re being honest, how much of the time we spend away from our kids for work is actually related to putting food on the table? How much of it is truly rooted in need? In the basics of a healthy, sustainable life? Probably not nearly as much as we tell ourselves (or them).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We work for other reasons - often good reasons - but not because we have to. We could have more flexibility if we wanted. We could choose a different job. We could choose to put family over career advancement, over six- or seven-figure salaries, over keeping up with the Joneses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let us stop acting as if the freedom - and opportunity - we crave isn’t within our grasp. We can spend more time with our kids. We can be there</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>more than we are. We just have to be comfortable making less money.</p>

<ul>
<li>Russ Roberts, the economist, has another rule, as a father, that we should all observe</li>
</ul>
<p>as parents:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your child offers you a hand to hold, take it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life and relationships are an endless dance of reaching out and pulling away. You reach out to your kids, they pull away—they’re busy, they’re in</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>front of their friends, they’re mad at you. You try to help them and they don’t want it. You want what’s best for them but they don’t understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can’t control that. What we can control is that whenever they do reach out—whenever they offer us a hand to hold—we take that opportunity and grab it. When they want to lie in our bed with us, we can let them. When they call on the phone, we can answer—even if we’re in a meeting. When they ask to talk about something, we can listen, whatever it’s about. We can hold them tight every chance we have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can’t demand that those things happen, but we can make a rule that when they do, we take it for as long as it’s being given.</p>

<li>the leadership coach Randall Stutman, who has worked with nearly</li>
</ul>
<p>every major hedge fund and CEO on Wall Street, talks about what it
means to be a leader at home:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code class="language-text">Your job as a leader is to make really fast transitions. You play many different roles in many different places—your job is not to carry the last conversation... If that means you need to settle yourself and sit out in your car for a couple of minutes before you walk in the house so you can now be Dad, then that’s what you need to do. But your job is not to walk into that house and carry with you anything that came from before.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can’t let a bad day or a bad person prevent you from being a good</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>parent. You can’t bring your garbage from the office into your home. You
must keep a clean house—free of the detritus of adult responsibility that your kids couldn’t possibly understand. You must leave that stuff outside, and you must do it quickly, in the space between leaving work and walking into your home.</p>

<p>“We are being watched by our ancestors, as I am watching you,” he told her. “We possess more than they ever dreamed of having, so we must never let them down.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are watched by our ancestors, yes, but we are also, as Bruce Springsteen put it, haunted by their ghosts. Which will you be for your child? Are you the kind of example they need? Have you left the kind of legacy that will protect them? That will guide them? That will inspire them to be decent and disciplined, great and good, as Arthur did for his young daughter? Or will you haunt them with your mistakes, with the pain you inflicted on them, with the things left unsaid or unresolved?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>when our kids mess up, we say: Aren’t you a little old to act this way? Grow up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately, we apply this standard to ourselves far less often. Whether it’s as serious as an affair or as silly as getting hangry because we neglected to eat, we seem to forget that we should be policing ourselves first. Our kids are at least still kids, even when they’re acting a bit beneath their age. You’re</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>an adult. What excuse do you have?</p>
<ul>
<li>Remind yourself today and every day that you are getting older, that it’s time to grow out of these silly habits you’ve lazily allowed yourself to fall into. Remind yourself that you’re too old to act out, to stoop this low, to not be responsible for yourself. And remember, your kids are always watching,</li>
</ul>
<p>so act like the adult that they believe you are.</p>

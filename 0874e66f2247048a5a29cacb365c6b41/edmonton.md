# Ellerslie 

Here’s a comprehensive investor‑style neighborhood outline for Ellerslie in southeast Edmonton, based on the latest publicly available data (\~2019–2025):

---

## ✅ 1. Nearby amenities & attractions

* Several small parks and pathway networks throughout the community ([City of Edmonton][1])
* Nearby Summerside and Walker Park, local playgrounds, and the former Ellerslie Rugby Park (closed 2022) ([Wikipedia][2])
* Commercial nodes along Ellerslie Road and 91 Street provide grocery stores, banks, fast food, small restaurants, and proximity to South Edmonton and Windermere shopping areas ([AreaVibes][3])

---

## 🏗️ 2. When houses were built & common building types

* Community planned in early‑2000s; rapid residential development followed, mostly completed by mid‑2010s ([City of Edmonton][1])
* Building types: \~60–66% single‑family detached; \~20% row/semi‑detached/duplex; \~12–15% townhouses; low‑rise apartments \~5–12% ([Gimme-Shelter][4])

---

## 📐 3. Zoning and density (units per lot)

* Based on Edmonton’s Area Structure Plan and Neighbourhood Structure Plan, zoning supports low to medium density: R‑1 (single detached), R‑2/R‑3 (semi, duplex) and R TH / R AD for townhouses/apartments in specific nodes.
* Most lots are single‑detached; townhome/duplex zones allow multiple units per lot in designated blocks. Opportunities exist in re‑zoning older lots for infill, but majority built-out under original zoning plan ([City of Edmonton][1], [Wikipedia][5])

---

## 🧍 4. Population & growth

* 2012 municipal census: 5,566 residents, 5.7 % growth since 2009 ([Wikipedia][6])
* Broader Ellerslie area (including Orchards, Summerside) had \~8,400 residents by 2019 across \~3,000 dwellings (\~2.49 km²) ([Gimme-Shelter][4])

---

## 💰 5. Average income

* Median household income \~C\$106,400—\~12% above Alberta average, and \~29% above national average ([AreaVibes][3])

---

## 🚨 6. Crime rate

* Overall crime \~11% lower than Edmonton average; raw rate \~5,695 per 100,000 people—though Edmonton averages are high in national terms ([AreaVibes][3])

---

## 🏘️ 7. Rental supply & demand

* Current rental listings in Ellerslie (\~19–25 active units across types); mix of duplexes, townhouses, condos, basement suites, some single‑family rental houses ([RentFaster.ca][7])
* Demand seems modest but steady; many homeowners, but also families and professional renters nearby. Limited supply but data is partial.

---

## 💵 8. Average rents

According to RentFaster and Zumper:

* Duplexes: avg \~\$2,216 /mo (ranges \~\$2,100–2,300)
* Townhouses: avg \~\$1,746 /mo (\~1,525–1,850)
* Condos/apartments: \~\$1,573 /mo
* Basements: \~\$1,095–1,350 (\~avg \$1,222)
* Houses: \~\$2,275 for full single‑family rental ([RentFaster.ca][7])

---

## 🏙️ 9. A/B/C/D Neighborhood Grade

* Livability score \~66/100 (“Good”)
* Amenities score D (few local amenities), crime grade D, cost of living A, employment A+, housing A, but schools D+ ([AreaVibes][3])
* Overall this suggests a **B‑range** neighborhood: strong housing, income, safety; limited walkable retail/schools.

---

## 📊 10. House prices & appreciation potential

* Specific median sale price data not in public summary; market listed by some sources as “n/a” ([AreaVibes][3])
* Comparatively newer suburban southeast area, moderate‑to‑strong long‑term appeal tied to Windermere expansion, proximity to Anthony Henday, growing population.
* Likely price growth in line with Edmonton suburban avg (\~3–5% annually), with upside via infill or densification.

---

## 💡 11. Investment strategies

### ✅ A. Value-add / infill

* Acquire older single‑family on standard lots and apply for rezoning/infill (duplex, townhome) to increase density and cashflow.

### ✅ B. New-build rental or townhomes

* Develop small multi‑unit infill. New units in townhome form can command \$1,700–2,200+/mo.

### ✅ C. Long‑term hold (buy & hold single family)

* With median income and low vacancy rates, rent well. Stable moderate cashflow if leveraged.

### ✅ D. BRRRR strategy on basement suites

* Purchase single-family, add legal basement rental suite; collect basement rent (\~\$1,200) while long-term tenants upstairs.

### ✅ E. Multi-family rental block

* Invest in or develop low-rise apartment units in designated zones near transit corridors or commercial nodes.

---

## 🏘️ 8. Rental supply & demand

* Appreciation: Properties in Grovenor typically steady long‑term growth, buoyed by mature location, infill potential, and core‑area attraction; modest rental yields vs appreciation from price growth.

---

## 🧰 12. Investment strategies that fit Grovenor

### ✅ A. Infill / Build-Down

* Convert older single‑family homes by adding **legal basement suites** or secondary units for rental income.

### B. BRRRR or Legal Basement Suites

* Buying a detached or row‐home, renovating and adding a legal basement suite can boost rental income and value.

### C. Small Multi‑unit or Townhouse Redevelopment

* Under NSP and zoning, possible to acquire older units and redevelop into row housing or low-rise townhouses to increase density and yield.

### D. Entry-level Rentals Targeting Young Families/Professionals

* With average income below city average, lower‑cost 2‑3 bedroom rentals appeal to middle-income households, students, and entry workers.

Belmead is a **value-oriented, family-friendly neighbourhood** with strong occupancy, affordable housing, and solid rental demand. While crime is elevated relative to city norms, residents benefit from close proximity to West Edmonton Mall, convenient transit routes, and a built environment supportive of **infill redevelopment and density upgrades**. For investors: good opportunity for **cash flow entry**, value‑add via **suite conversions or row-house infill**, and potential for moderate appreciation tied to mature west‑Edmonton growth dynamics.

# Kilkenny

Here’s an investor‑focused profile of **Kilkenny**, a mature northeast Edmonton neighbourhood, updated through mid‑2025:

---

## 🏙️ 1. Nearby Amenities & Attractions

* Serviced by **Londonderry Mall** just south in Kildare, plus **North Town Centre** & **Northgate Centre** nearby. Also on-site **Londonderry Fitness & Leisure Centre**, playfields, and athletic grounds within Kilkenny ([Wikipedia][1]).
* Parks include **Kilkenny Park**, **G. Edmund Kelly Park**, spray park, and well-connected school grounds ([AreaVibes][2]).

---

## 🏗️ 2. Housing Age & Development Timeline

* Development largely occurred in the **1960s (≈51%)** and **1970s (≈23%)**, with most build-out completed by **1990** ([Wikipedia][1], [City of Edmonton][3]).

---

## 🏡 3. Common Building Types

* Of all dwellings: **\~60% single‑detached houses**, **\~30% low-rise apartments**, and **\~10% row houses**; duplexes/triplexes negligible (<1%) ([Wikipedia][1]).
* Owner‑occupancy \~62%, rental \~38% ([Wikipedia][1]).

---

## 📐 4. Zoning & Density Potential

* Zoned for **low to medium density** residential. Dominated by single-family zoning, with pockets of row‑housing and low‑rise apartments.
* Some potential exists for infill or small multi-unit redevelopments within the mature Londonderry overlay—but mass densification is limited without rezoning ([Wikipedia][4]).

---

## 👥 5. Population & Growth

* **2012 municipal census**: 5,715 residents in \~1.75 km², density ~~3,266/km². Population declined slightly (~~–1.9%) from 2009 ([Wikipedia][1]).
* More recent estimates: **\~4,500 residents in \~1,500 homes** (Gimme Shelter) ([Gimme-Shelter][5]).
* Growth is flat to moderate; mobility rates moderate: \~13% moved within 12 months and \~20% within 1–3 years (2005 data) ([Wikipedia][1]).

---

## 💰 6. Average Household Income

* Median household income around **C\$72,571**, \~12% below Canada average and \~23% below Alberta average ([AreaVibes][2]).

---

## 🚨 7. Crime Rate

* Crime rate: **7,661 per 100,000**, about **20% higher than Edmonton average**, **81% above national average**. Risk of victimization: **1 in 14** annually ([AreaVibes][6]).

---

## 🏘️ 8. Rental Supply & Demand

* Rental listings modest: Zillow shows only **3 current apartment listings**, rents between **C\$1,339–1,779** ([Zillow][7]).
* Zumper lists **\~25 house rentals** across adjacent areas, though few directly in Kilkenny; typical rents \~C\$1,300–1,400 ([Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][8]).

---

## 💵 9. Average Rents

* Small apartments (1 bd) average \~**C\$1,340–1,360/month**; larger units (3 bd) around **C\$1,780/month** ([Zillow][7], [Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][8]).
* Little data on row houses, but they are likely similar or slightly more.

---

## 🏅 10. Neighborhood Grade

* **Livability 67/100**; amenities C, employment C+, cost of living A+, housing B+; crime rated F in Areavibes grading ([AreaVibes][2]).
* Overall, Kilkenny is a **C‑ or lower B‑grade area**: affordable housing but higher crime and average incomes.

---

## 📈 11. Average House Prices & Appreciation Potential

* MLS listings mid‑2025 show **townhomes \~C\$220k**, single‑family homes **C\$399–435k**; apartments as low as **C\$78–81k** ([Zillow][9], [edmontonrealestate.pro][10]).
* Overall values remain entry-level relative to Edmonton norm; neighborhood offers modest appreciation but limited upside unless broader area revitalization occurs.

---

## 🧰 12. Investment Strategies

### ✅ A. Buy‑and‑Hold Entry-Level Rentals

* Low acquisition costs (\~C\$400k) and rents \~C\$1,300–1,780/mo offer moderate positive cash flow even with elevated risk from crime; good for affordable market tenants.

### ✅ B. BRRRR with Basement Suites

* Legal suites in bungalows can raise total rent income, improving return in lower-priced homes.

### ✅ C. Small Infill or Row-House Redevelopment

* Opportunities where row housing allowed; limited scale but could densify pockets within zoning provisions.

### ✅ D. Acquire & Renovate Value Properties

* Cosmetic upgrades or modest renovation of aging apartments or townhomes could extract value for resale or rent bump.

---

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. Pull **recent MLS sales and rent comps** (2023–25) for price-to-rent cap yield insights.
2. Examine **City of Edmonton zoning maps and the Northmount/Londonderry plans** to discover infill viability.
3. Review **EPS crime mapping portal** for block-by-block trends and hotspots ([Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][8], [Wikipedia][11], [Wikipedia][1], [AreaVibes][2], [AreaVibes][6]).
4. Analyze vacancy & rent trends through **CMHC or platform data** for rental demand clarity.

---

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

Kilkenny presents a **budget-friendly entry point** for investors targeting stable rents and modest returns. While crime rates and below-average income dampen appeal, the low property prices combined with demand for affordable family housing create **cash-flow opportunities**. Best suited for investors interested in **value-add via suites or renovations**, or **long-term hold** in an affordable mature area with limited appreciation potential.

# **Belvedere**

Here’s a detailed real‑estate‑investing profile for **Belvedere**, a mature neighbourhood in northeast Edmonton:

---

## 1. Nearby Amenities & Attractions

* **Transit**: Belvedere LRT station (Capital Line) with large park-and-ride (≈780 stalls) provides strong transit connectivity ([nexthome.ca][1], [Wikipedia][2]).
* **Shopping**: Londonderry Mall is just northwest at 137 Ave & 66 St in Kildare ([Wikipedia][3]). Commercial corridors along Fort Road and 66 St include retail and services ([belvederecl.com][4]).
* **Recreation & Landmarks**: Community league facilities (hall, outdoor rink), plus historic Transit Hotel and a prominent brick smokestack visible from LRT ([Wikipedia][3]).

---

## 2. Housing Age & Common Types

* Most construction occurred **between 1946 and 1985**, with over 90% of residences built in that era ([Wikipedia][3]).
* **Breakdown of dwelling types** (approximate):

  * Apartments/low‑rise: \~45%
  * Single-family houses: \~42%
  * Duplexes: \~8%
  * Row houses: \~6% ([Wikipedia][3]).

---

## 3. Zoning & Density Potential

* Located in a **mature area sector**, zoning is mostly traditional residential (R‑class). Edmonton zoning does permit secondary suites, duplex, row‑house, and some multi‑unit conversions depending on lot size and local overlays. You would need to consult the city’s current zoning map for Belvedere under the Mature Area Overlay to confirm allowable density including multiplex or low-rise multi‑unit. (Typical RPL, RSL, or RMD zones may allow more units per lot with design and lot‑size compliance.)

---

## 4. Population & Growth

* In **2012**, population was around **5,085** over 1.67 km² (≈3,045 people/km²) and had grown about 2.2% since 2009 ([Wikipedia][3]).
* **More recent figures** (AreaVibes): population \~5,805, median age \~37.8, livability score 69/100 (good) ([AreaVibes][5]). Indicative modest slow growth.

---

## 5. Income Levels

* From 2001–2010 era data, **median household income** ~~\$48,600; **average \~\$56,800**—well below the city average (~~\$72,000 median, \~\$90,000 average) ([City of Edmonton][6], [nexthome.ca][1]).
* Local Logic more recent estimate: **individual income \~\$37,200**, **family income \~\$69,800** ([Local Logic][7]).

---

## 6. Crime Rate

* Crime rates are significantly high: total crime \~108% above national average; violent crime \~62% above national average. Residents face a 1‑in‑12 chance of becoming a victim. Crime is about **38% above Edmonton average** ([AreaVibes][8]).

---

## 7. Rental Supply & Demand

* **Approximately half of households rent** (\~48–50%) and half own (\~50%) ([Wikipedia][3], [AreaVibes][9]).
* As of early August 2025, **\~23 active rental listings**, median rent \~\$1,335/month, up almost 8% year‑over‑year ([Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][10]).
* Rental stock appears stable with moderate demand, but supply is not extremely tight.

---

## 8. Average Rents

* **Median rental rate in Belvedere**: \~\$1,335/month for apartments of all sizes ([Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][10]).
* Approx breakdown: average 1‑bedroom \~\$1,119; 2‑bedroom \~\$1,528; studios \~\$1,019 ([Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][10]).
* City-wide Edmonton averages range \~\$1,365 to \$1,520/month depending on source ([Apartments.com][11], [Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][12]).

---

## 9. Neighborhood Quality Classification

* By standard real‑estate grading (A = upscale/low‑crime to D = disadvantaged/high risk): Belvedere would align closer to **C or D**, reflecting lower incomes, elevated crime rates, older stock, and mixed ownership/rental status.

---

## 10. Home Prices & Appreciation Potential

* As of mid‑2025:

  * Listings average pricing \~\$150–180 K (per listings), price per sqft \~\$179–286 depending on data source ([edmontonrealestate.ca][13], [HonestDoor][14]).
  * HonestDoor reports average sale price \~\$366,800; sold price per sqft \~\$286 ([HonestDoor][14]).
  * AreaVibes median for Edmonton is \~\$370K, while Belvedere likely below that ([AreaVibes][9]).
* **Returns/Cashflow**: average rents (~~\$1,335) vs property cost (~~\$180–370 K) suggests gross rental yield \~4‑8%, modest cashflow depending on financing and expenses.

**Long‑term potential**:

* Proximity to LRT and mature area redevelopment could support value appreciation. However, elevated crime and lower income limit demand from owner‑occupiers. Appreciation upside may hinge on targeted improvement, infill redevelopment, or converting low‑rise to multiplex units.

---

## 11. Investment Strategies That Could Work

1. **Small multi‑suite income properties**: Acquire older homes and add secondary suites (permitted) to boost yield.
2. **Low‑rise redevelopment or multiplex builds**: Under R‑zoning if permitted, subdividing or building duplex/triplex can increase units.
3. **Buy-and-hold rental**: Affordable entry point, stable rental demand; focus on landlords comfortable managing older stock.
4. **Value-add flips or renovations**: Improve curb appeal, safety, rentability to attract better tenants or resale buyers.
5. **Transit-oriented rental strategy**: Marketing to students and commuters using LRT access.

| Appreciation potential | Moderate; depends on densification, LRT proximity, property improvements |

---

### Recommendations

* **Due diligence**: Confirm current zoning maps (City of Edmonton zoning: RPL, RSL, etc.) and development bylaws to see if more units per lot allowed.
* **Site visits**: Evaluate safety, tenancy, condition, and surrounding investments.
* **Target property types**: Multi‑suite homes or buildings ripe for infill redevelopment.
* **Exit strategy**: Consider hold long‑term for rental income or flip after renovations.
* **Mitigate risks**: Criminal activity and lower-income demographics mean tenant screening, security, and property maintenance are vital.

---

Belvedere offers **very affordable entry point** with good transit connectivity and a mix of rental occupants—but it carries **elevated crime and modest growth**. For investors with experience in managing older or lower‑income rental stock and pursuing infill or small multiplex redevelopment, it can offer cashflow and moderate appreciation upside over time.

# Kildare

Here's a detailed outline and analysis of Kildare, a mature northeast Edmonton neighbourhood in the Londonderry area:

---

## 1. Nearby Amenities & Attractions 🏬

* **Londonderry Mall** sits within Kildare at 66 Street & 137–144 Avenue, offering major retail, services & dining ([Wikipedia][1]).
* **Londonderry Athletic Grounds**, with sports fields, running track & fitness centre, lie adjacent and serve the community broadly ([Wikipedia][1]).
* **Parks within Kildare** include Kildare Park and Cherrydale Park, which feature playgrounds, fields and gathering spaces ([Wikipedia][1]).
* Nearby transit access is solid, supporting walkability, biking and transit commutes ([Local Logic][2]).

---

## 2. When were houses commonly built?

* Majority of residential development occurred in the **1960s through the 1980s/early 1990s** ([City of Edmonton][3]).

---

## 3. Common Building Types

* Around **60% are single-detached homes**. The remaining \~40% comprises **row houses, low-rise apartments and duplexes** ([Gimme-Shelter][4]).

---

## 4. Zoning Regulations & Unit Multiplicity

* Edmonton’s Zoning Bylaw 20001 (effective Jan 1, 2024) introduces the **RS Zone** allowing up to **8 dwelling units per lot** by default depending on lot area and configuration ([Storeys][5]).
* Under the RS Zone, a **minimum 225 m² lot supports at least 3 units**; a **600 m² lot allows up to 8 units** including basement suites, row housing or multiplexes ([Situate Inc.][6]).
* Proposed council debate (June 2025) aims to possibly reduce the maximum to **6 units per mid‑block lot**, but as of now the eight-unit cap is still in effect ([Taproot Edmonton][7]).

---

## 5. Population & Growth

* In 2012, the population was **2,763 living in 1,209 dwellings**, a **–4.3% decline** since 2009 ([Wikipedia][8]).
* More recent growth: the greater Londonderry area (Kildare + Kilkenny) may have seen modest recovery; Kildare is not listed as high‑growth.
* HonestDoor reports **+7.14% average price growth year-over-year** (likely correlated to modest demand) but not direct population growth data ([Wikipedia][1], [HonestDoor][9]).

---

## 6. Average Household Income

* Specific Kildare income stats unavailable; neighboring York had average household income around **\$53,200 (2001)** vs Edmonton average \$57,360 at that time ([Wikipedia][10]).
* Given demographic similarities, **Kildare income is likely at or slightly below Edmonton average**.

---

## 7. Crime Rate

* Kildare’s crime rate is reported as approximately **93% higher than the Canadian average**, with violent crime around **50% above average**, and a **1-in-13 chance** of victimization. It's safer than only \~24% of Alberta neighbourhoods ([AreaVibes][11]).

---

## 8. Rental Supply & Demand

* Rental turnover is moderate: about **40% renter-occupied units** in community ([Gimme-Shelter][4]).
* Some townhomes and apartments available: only around **1–2 current rentals online** in Kildare specifically, showing **limited supply** and stable demand ([Zillow][12]).

---

## 9. Average Rents

* A current **townhouse rental for 2 bed / 2 bath** was listed at approximately **C\$1,365/mo** ([Zillow][12]).
* Other listings in surrounding areas ranged **C\$1,200–1,900 per month** depending on bedroom count.

---

## 10. Neighborhood Grade (A/B/C/D)

* Kildare is a **mature, working-to-middle income community** with aging stock, moderate income and elevated crime.
* It likely falls into a **“C” grade neighborhood**, with some potential upside but also limitations.

---

## 11. Long-term Appreciation vs Cash‑Flow

* The average property price is around **C\$269,000 (HonestDoor)**, with listed active homes averaging **C\$310,000**, and an average of **C\$279/sqft** ([HonestDoor][9], [AreaVibes][11], [Reddit][13], [edmontonrealestate.ca][14]).
* Year-over-year growth \~7 % indicates modest appreciation. With average rents at approx **\$1,400/month**, gross rents are about < 6% yield on typical prices—thin positive cash flow.
* Appreciation appears stronger than cash flow, making it more drift toward **value-growth/revitalization play**, not high-yield.

---

## 12. Average House Prices

* **HonestDoor average property price:** \~**C\$269,210** ([HonestDoor][9]).
* **Current active listings average:** \~**C\$309,800** (range \$130k to \$450k) ([Wahi][15]).

---

## 13. Investment Strategies That Could Work

* **Missing‑Middle Infill Strategy**: Given RS zoning allows 3–8 units per lot, a duplex or row‑house infill with secondary suites could boost net operating income.
* **Renovation & Hold**: Purchase older single-detached homes at lower cost, renovate and hold for moderate rent and capital growth.
* **Condoconversion**: As some multiplexes can be condominiumized over time, converting to condos could allow resale exit strategies ([Storeys][5], [Reddit][13]).
* **Buy & Rent to Own/GRSP**: Mid‑market affordability attracts renter‑families; offering rent‑to‑own may attract stable tenants.
* **Focus on turn‑key row‑house units** for reliable tenancy and tighter maintenance.

### ✅ Final Thoughts

Kildare is a mature, affordable neighborhood with solid transit, retail, and sports amenities. It offers opportunity for **infill/missing-middle development**, but crime and aging housing stock remain challenges. It's best suited for investors seeking **moderate appreciation and slow, steady rental income**, rather than high‑yield cash‑flow plays. Tight evaluation of acquisition cost, financing, and renovation/infill potential is crucial to success.

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy and Hold
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Purchase properties to rent out while holding them for long-term appreciation.</li>
<li>Why it works: Thorncliffe is a well-established neighborhood with stable rental demand due to its proximity to key amenities, schools, and easy access to downtown Calgary. The area is popular among families and working professionals, making it ideal for long-term tenants.</li>
<li>Rental Income: Given its stable housing market and reasonable property prices, buy-and-hold investors can generate consistent rental income, particularly with single-family homes and townhomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Secondary Suite Conversions
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Converting single-family homes into properties with secondary rental suites.</li>
<li>Why it works: Many older homes in Thorncliffe sit on large lots, which may offer opportunities to develop legal basement or garage suites. This strategy can help maximize rental income from a single property, making the investment more profitable.</li>
<li>Target Tenants: This strategy could appeal to families or professionals looking for affordable housing options, and the additional rental unit can diversify income streams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Renovation and Flipping
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Buying older homes, renovating them, and selling for a profit.</li>
<li>Why it works: Many homes in Thorncliffe were built between the 1950s and 1980s, making them prime candidates for renovation. Upgrading these homes with modern finishes and energy-efficient improvements can appeal to buyers looking for move-in-ready homes.</li>
<li>Target Buyers: First-time homebuyers or families looking for affordable, updated homes in a mature neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Infill Development
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Purchasing larger lots and developing new infill properties.</li>
<li>Why it works: Thorncliffe has areas where older homes on large lots are being redeveloped into multi-family units or modern single-family homes. This strategy may work particularly well if zoning regulations allow for increased density (e.g., duplexes or townhouses).</li>
<li>Potential Returns: Infill projects can command premium prices, especially as demand for newer, energy-efficient homes grows in mature neighborhoods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rent-to-Own (Lease Option)
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Offering rent-to-own options to tenants.</li>
<li>Why it works: Thorncliffe’s relatively affordable home prices make it an attractive area for buyers who may not yet qualify for a mortgage but are looking for a pathway to homeownership. Investors can structure rent-to-own deals to attract tenants who eventually want to buy the property.</li>
<li>Benefits: This strategy provides consistent rental income with the potential to sell the property to the tenant in the future, locking in an exit strategy early on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multi-Family Investment
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Investing in or converting homes into multi-family or duplex properties.</li>
<li>Why it works: If zoning permits, creating multi-family units can provide higher cash flow per property. Thorncliffe’s demographic mix of families, professionals, and retirees can support demand for duplexes or multi-family units.</li>

The community is close to several bus routes and CTrain stations, making public transit convenient. The area also has parks, community centers, and local shopping options​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Housing age:</strong> Most houses in Ogden were built between 1912 and the mid-20th century, as it is one of Calgary’s older neighborhoods​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Common building types:</strong> The housing stock in Ogden mainly consists of single-family homes, duplexes, and some townhouses. It’s a mix of older homes with some newer developments​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zoning regulations:</strong> Ogden has primarily residential zoning, allowing for both single-family and multi-family homes. Calgary has been updating zoning laws recently, potentially allowing for increased density and more units per lot in certain areas​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Population and growth:</strong> The population of Ogden is around 8,000. While the area has seen slow growth due to its mature status, development and infrastructure improvements could boost population increases in the future​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average income:</strong> The median household income in Ogden is around $70,817, which is lower than Calgary’s overall average​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crime rate:</strong> The crime rate in Ogden is higher than the Calgary average, with property crime being a particular concern. However, it is safer than 50% of Alberta communities​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rental supply and demand:</strong> Ogden has a healthy rental market, with options ranging from basements to houses. The average rent is about $1,757 across different property types, with demand steadily increasing as the area becomes more attractive to renters​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average rents:</strong> Rents in Ogden vary, with prices ranging from about $1,350 for basement suites to over $2,500 for larger houses​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neighborhood rating (A, B, C, D):</strong> Ogden would be considered a C neighborhood, offering affordability and amenities but facing higher crime rates and lower average incomes compared to some other parts of Calgary​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-term potential vs. current returns:</strong> Ogden has long-term potential due to its affordability, proximity to downtown Calgary, and recent infrastructure developments. While current cash flow and returns are moderate, increased zoning flexibility and improvements in public transport could enhance property values in the future​</p>
<ul>
<li>Ogden is expected to see significant appreciation as zoning changes allow for more in-fill developments, and the CTrain extension improves accessibility and more connected to downtown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Value-add (infill development or legal basement suites)</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy and Hold
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Purchase properties to rent out and hold for long-term appreciation.</li>
<li>Why it works: Ogden is an established neighborhood with relatively affordable home prices, making it attractive for investors. The upcoming Green Line LRT extension, which is set to pass through the area, increases the potential for future appreciation. With its proximity to industrial and commercial hubs, rental demand is likely to remain steady.</li>
<li>Rental Income: Steady demand for affordable housing from working-class tenants ensures a reliable rental income stream.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Secondary Suite Conversions
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Adding a legal secondary suite to single-family homes.</li>
<li>Why it works: Many of Ogden’s homes are older and sit on larger lots, offering space for secondary suite conversions. Calgary’s push for legalizing secondary suites supports this strategy, and Ogden’s affordability makes it feasible to add basement or garage suites to boost rental income.</li>
<li>Target Tenants: Dual-suite properties can appeal to both families and individual renters looking for more affordable rental options in an accessible location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Renovation and Flipping
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Buying older homes, renovating them, and selling for a profit.</li>
<li>Why it works: Many homes in Ogden were built in the mid-20th century and are now in need of modernization. Investors can purchase these properties at lower prices, renovate them to add value, and sell to first-time homebuyers or families looking for affordable, move-in-ready homes.</li>
<li>Target Buyers: First-time buyers or families attracted to a renovated home close to the new Green Line LRT and employment centers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Infill Development
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Purchasing older properties on larger lots for redevelopment.</li>
<li>Why it works: Ogden has many older homes on larger lots, providing opportunities for infill development. With the neighborhood’s improving infrastructure, including the upcoming Green Line LRT, redeveloping single-family homes into multi-family units, duplexes, or modern single-family homes can generate strong returns.</li>
<li>Potential Returns: Infill projects can help meet the demand for modern, affordable homes, and new developments can attract buyers or renters looking for housing close to transportation routes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multi-Family Investment
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Investing in multi-family or small apartment buildings.</li>
<li>Why it works: Ogden has a mix of single-family homes and small multi-family properties. Investors can acquire or develop multi-family buildings to meet the demand from working-class families and individuals who prefer rental accommodations. The neighborhood’s industrial employment centers provide a steady tenant base.</li>
<li>Rental Demand: The close proximity to industrial areas and major transportation routes ensures a reliable demand for rental units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Land Banking
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Purchasing vacant or underdeveloped land for future appreciation and development.</li>
<li>Why it works: As the Green Line LRT project progresses and infrastructure improves, vacant land or older properties in Ogden may appreciate significantly. Investors can hold onto land or properties for future development when the area’s demand increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rent-to-Own (Lease Option)
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Offering properties as rent-to-own options to tenants.</li>
<li>Why it works: Ogden is an affordable neighborhood, which can attract tenants who are not yet ready to buy but are interested in homeownership. Offering rent-to-own deals allows tenants to rent while gradually working towards purchasing the property, providing a steady income for the investor and a clear exit strategy.</li>
<li>Target Tenants: Tenants who want to eventually transition to homeownership.</li>

<li>rent-to-own: Mahogany offers a master-planned community with luxury amenities (e.g., lake access), making it ideal for families seeking high-quality living.

<ul>
<li>
<p>Known for its lake, Chestermere is popular for families seeking a lifestyle community. Homes here are larger, and there is demand for rental properties due to its proximity to Calgary and appeal for recreational activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Buy-and-hold or luxury rentals</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> Chestermere’s lakeside appeal makes it a strong candidate for buy-and-hold investments. Luxury rentals targeting families seeking recreational amenities can generate higher rental yields.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A historic luxury neighborhood, Mount Royal is home to Calgary’s elite. With large estate homes and proximity to downtown, it remains one of the most prestigious areas in the city. However, prices are high, and appreciation is more moderate due to the already premium pricing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Luxury buy-and-hold</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> Mount Royal’s premium housing market offers steady long-term appreciation. Investors in high-end properties can capitalize on luxury rentals or hold properties for future gains.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Bel-Aire is another exclusive neighborhood offering large homes with impressive lots. Long-term appreciation is strong, but the high entry point limits accessibility for most investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Luxury rentals</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> Similar to Mount Royal, Bel-Aire attracts high-net-worth individuals. Investors can rent out luxury homes for significant income or hold for long-term appreciation.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of the Aspen community, Aspen Woods offers some of Calgary’s most luxurious homes. The area appeals to high-net-worth individuals looking for proximity to top schools and amenities. While expensive, Aspen Woods offers excellent long-term investment potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Luxury buy-and-hold or executive rentals</p>

<p>Best communities: The seminar highlighted quadrant-specific communities worth investing in, including:</p>
<p>Deep South: Mahogany, Walden, Copperfield, and Cranson are seeing strong growth due to amenities like the hospital, schools, shopping, and accessibility via the Stoney Trail ring road.
South: Midnapore, Queensland, and Ogden have significant price growth due to affordable pricing and proximity to employment centers like hospitals and transit routes.
West and Northwest: Communities like Aspen, Springbank Hill, Glenbrook, and Strathcona offer strong returns for higher-end homes and good rental opportunities due to their proximity to schools, parks, and transit. Older neighborhoods like Thorncliffe, Huntington Hills, and Brentwood provide affordable investment options with long-term growth potential.
Newer communities: There was caution against investing in newer communities without established amenities. These areas are seen as long-term plays, where amenities are still being developed, but they may suffer from lower initial rental demand.</p>
<p>Zoning and development: The forum emphasized the importance of understanding zoning changes and upcoming infrastructure projects (e.g., new CTrain routes) that can impact long-term investment value. Ogden, for example, is expected to see significant appreciation as zoning changes allow for more in-fill developments, and the CTrain extension improves accessibility.</p>
<p>Rental trends: The forum noted that rental properties near key amenities like shopping, transit, and schools tend to perform better. They highlighted opportunities in townhouse and condo markets, especially in more affordable areas with high rental demand, such as Walden and Ogden.</p>
<p>Long-term potential vs. current cash flow: Investors were encouraged to focus on long-term appreciation rather than just cash flow. Established communities in Calgary with solid infrastructure and accessibility (e.g., Midnapore, Huntington Hills, and Glenbrook) were recommended for steady growth over time.</p>
<p>Neighborhood quality: Communities were categorized by potential for returns, with high-end neighborhoods like Aspen offering steady appreciation but higher entry points, while more affordable areas like Queensland and Thorncliffe showed greater short-term price jumps due to affordability-driven demand.</p>
<p>Deep South
Mahogany, Walden, Copperfield, Cranson: High sales volumes and interest, driven by amenities like hospitals, parks, schools, and shopping centers. Accessibility via the Stoney Trail ring road boosts demand. Communities are desirable for both homebuyers and renters, with newer homes attracting young families.
South Calgary
Midnapore, Queensland, Ogden: Midnapore offers a lakeside community and good amenities. Queensland and Ogden are more affordable but have seen significant price appreciation, with rental demand increasing due to proximity to employment centers and the future CTrain line in Ogden, which is expected to push prices further.
West Calgary
Aspen, Springbank Hill, Glenbrook, Strathcona: These neighborhoods feature higher-end homes with substantial long-term appreciation potential. The west side is known for its proximity to quality schools, parks, and amenities like Westside Rec Centre. Aspen and Springbank Hill are high-cost areas but provide luxury and long-term gains. Glenbrook and Strathcona offer more affordable options with rental demand.
Northwest Calgary
Tuscany, Silver Springs, Ranchlands, Varsity: The northwest is characterized by easy access to transit and good amenities. Communities like Tuscany and Silver Springs have strong demand for both ownership and rentals. Older communities, including Ranchlands and Varsity, provide affordable homes with potential for renovation and solid returns.
North Calgary
Thorncliffe, Beddington, Huntington Hills: These established neighborhoods are benefiting from affordability and future infrastructure, including the extension of the CTrain line. Thorncliffe in particular has larger lot sizes and is expected to see strong growth.
Northeast Calgary
Whitehorn, Rundle, Pineridge, Temple: Working-class communities close to transit and employment hubs like the airport. These areas offer affordable housing with strong rental demand, especially from families. Properties near the CTrain line are particularly desirable.
Surrounding Towns
Cochrane, Airdrie, Chestermere: These towns are seeing increased demand from buyers looking for more affordable options outside Calgary. Rental demand is strong due to population growth and proximity to major employment centers like the airport and CrossIron Mills.
High-End Neighborhoods
Mount Royal, Bel-Aire, Aspen Woods: These luxury neighborhoods have seen a decrease in sales volume due to higher interest rates but remain desirable for long-term investors and affluent homebuyers.</p>

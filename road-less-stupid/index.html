<ul>
<li>It turns out that the key to getting rich (and staying that way) is to avoid doing stupid things. I don’t need to do more smart things. I just need to do fewer dumb things. I need to avoid making emotional decisions and swinging at bad pitches. I need to think!</li>
<li>All my problems started out as a good idea, and all those “good” ideas were emotionally justifiable at the time. Not only that, my current financial condition represents my very best “thinking.” Yours does, too.</li>
<li>What sabotages our dreams and causes most of our problems (and ensuing dumb tax) is our excessive optimism and emotional belief in magic pills, secret formulas, and financial tooth fairies. (All balloons look good when they are filled with hot air.) Dumb!</li>
<li>Emotions and intellect work inversely. When emotions go up, intellect goes down. Optimism is a deadly emotion in the business world. Warren Buffett said it best: “Optimism is the enemy of the rational investor.”</li>
<li>There are no secrets … just stuff you haven’t learned yet.</li>
<li>A business owner must knows that building a business is 80% an intellectual sport. Just like the great book by Napoleon hill says; Think and Grow Rich. Thinking is very essential to business growth. He who thinks deeper and wider wins the game. I dare say that Critical thinking is the name of the game. So where I am today is a product of my thinking or better still I am a product of how critical I think and analyze situations to make a decision. So every decision I make must take into consideration 2nd, 3rd and 4th order consequences when taking business decisions.</li>
<li>John Maynard Keyes astutely said, “Most people, when confronted with a choice of changing their thoughts or proving there is no need to change, get busy on the proof.” I am so guilty of this. Whenever I have a knack or feeling that an idea would work, I would rather go ahead and find proof that it would work instead of looking at all the sides critically.</li>
<li>“More often than not, critically thinking about what could go wrong and doing the work to mitigate those risks before taking action is abandoned in favor of comfort zones, the path of least resistance, and speed (instant gratification).</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>There’s no such thing as natural business owner</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hard work trumps natural talent: Like the world renowned scientist, Albert Einstein said that being a genius is 99% hard work and 1% inspiration. You need to put in the necessary hard work before you get any result at all. Just like Keith put it so beautifully; Great business owners work hard, practice, study, test, think, correct and practice some more. There is no short cut. Period!! You must be committed to excellence and seek ways to do things better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>attempting to win the game of business by trial and error is about the stupidest way to learn anything</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Never wing it: Most of us try to do this and hope that it will click, stick or have result. The issue with this is that it hardly succeeds and if it does you cannot repeat the process because you don’t have successive steps to show for it. So it’s not duplicable. Why would you do things by trial and error that would, in most times cost, you more in the long run, as opposed to take the necessary time to put into quality thinking to make better nosiness decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>running the wrong direction enthusiastically is stupid</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it does no good to practice the wrong thing. To excel you must get a coach or advisor that will watch very move you are making and then give advice on the right direction to take, because running in the wrong direction enthusiastically is just plain stupid. Please note that this coach or advisor must have succeeded in his own endeavor. In other words, been there done that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you want to do better, you must get better:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>people do not do better because <em>they want to do better</em>; they do better because they <em>get better</em>. You cannot achieve a new outcome without learning something new and practicing what you learned (probably outside your comfort zone). A commitment to mastery (improving) is essential for excellence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the people with the best life have the best choices</strong> people with a lousy life have lousy choices. If I want to improve my life, I need to create better choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you will pay dumb tax if you ignore these principles or you will pay to fix the problem. Either way, you are writing a check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>the road less stupid</em> is designed to accomplish 2 primary objectives</p>
<ul>
<li>provide a structure/process/skill set to enable you to create successful Thinking Time ritual that, if applied, will result in a significantly reduced dumb tax.</li>
<li>suggest a series of possible Thinking Time topics and questions you can use to spark your thinking, grow your business, make more money and ultimately avoid doing something stupid.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Find the Unasked Question</strong>-Create a question that will result in clarity and generate better choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Another thing to note in the way the question is framed. It must be framed in such a way that engenders possible solutions or available improvements to the solution. Otherwise it’s a mere predicament or a statement. So if you must craft a problem, use this “How might I…so that I can…? This rule or guide line provides insight on how to remedy the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you think of what needs to be broken versus what needs to be fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three characteristics that a carefully crafted question does are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides insight on what the actual problem is</li>
<li>Simplify the problem and make it solvable</li>
<li>Expand the number of possibilities available to solve the problem at hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having the right answer is smart. Having the right question is genius. Or, as Peter Drucker said, “Most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The truly  dangerous thing is asking the wrong question.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all problems are solvable (or at a minimum can be addressed so that we improve our situation). Our job as business owners and leadership teams is to get clarity on the right question to ask before we pull the trigger. We would all have better answers and more choices if we invested the time to design better questions and then actually allocated some Thinking Time to consider them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Separate the Problem from the Symptom</strong> — Identify the real obstacle that is blocking my progress.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The key to defining the root problem is discovering the obstacle (it resides in the gap) that is impeding your progress from here to there. It is the obstacle that is the problem, not the dissatisfaction with your current circumstances!</strong></li>
<li>Most times when I look back at some of the mistakes we made as a company I realized that the problem wasn’t clearly articulated or it was a wrong statement of problem. I would usually wonder why we don’t have enough sales, why we don’t have enough customers, low profits, difficulty in finding quality staff, keeping quality staff etc. These are questions that are always on our mind as business owners.</li>
<li>These questions are very valid but ultimately these questions are not the problems that exists but are rather the symptoms of a problem. We realized that we pointed out our biggest problems as the gaps between where we were and where we would like to be.</li>
<li>The symptom is the gap while the problem is the obstacle.</li>
<li>there are 2 fundamental difficulties with a misdiagnosis of root problem (or mislabeling the symptom as the obstacle)
<ul>
<li>the questions you ask and the solutions you find are usually tactical</li>
<li>when the machines are constructed and deployed to address the symptom (but not the root problem, obstacle), resources are wasted and there is zero sustainable forward progress toward the desired outcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the 3 most fundamental questions to ask to help get clarity about the root problem/obstacle are:
<ul>
<li>what are the possible reasons I’m noticing this symptom?</li>
<li>what isn’t happening that, if it did happen, would cause the perceived gap (symptoms) to either narrow or disappear?</li>
<li>what’s happening that, if it stopped happening, would cause the perceived gap (symptoms) to narrow or disappear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Building a machine for the problem that isn’t and expecting forward progress is delusional.</li>
<li>If we misdiagnose or mislabel the problem, we will gravitate toward designing solutions and building machines for the symptoms (aka “the problem that isn’t”) and this is a prescription for frustration and failure.</li>
<li>Few things are worse than running the wrong direction enthusiastically. Misdiagnosing the problem or working on the wrong priorities results in a dumb tax!</li>
<li>sustainable forward progress (aka “Kicking the Can”) is only possible by identifying
<ul>
<li>exactly where I am (Point A)</li>
<li>exactly where the can is</li>
<li>exactly where the goal line is in relation to me and the can (Point B) and</li>
<li>then overcoming the specific obstacle preventing the can from crossing the goal line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Assumptions</strong> - Differentiate the facts from the story I am spinning.</p>
<ul>
<li>What none of us see are the assumptions we make about the problem we have, the solution we create, or the opportunity in front of us. The reality is that virtually all my dumb tax could have been avoided if I had just questioned a couple of obvious assumptions prior to pulling the trigger.</li>
<li><strong>what don’t I see</strong>
<ul>
<li>what I don’t see is what costs me money</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buffet’s respond to $20 dollar bet:
<ul>
<li>“If I stood here and hit a thousand golf balls, the likelihood that any of them would go in the hole is very remote. Maybe if I hit 10K golf balls I might get lucky and one would go in; but, you’re not offering 10K - 1 odds. I know it’s a small amount of money and that I could easily affort it, but it’s bad odds. <strong>Stupid in small things, stupid in big things</strong>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We would be better off if we spent some quality Thinking Time differentiating the facts from our emotions and fantasies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider 2nd-Order Consequences</strong> - Clarify the risks and the possibility/cost of being wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>We only have a choice about the decision we are about to make, not the consequences. An important decision that does not identify the possible risks as well as the probability and costs of failure is a decision with a high likelihood of creating drama. The problem with drama is that it always costs money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I use the following 3 questions as one of my litmus tests to help me think before I act:
<ul>
<li><strong>what’s the upside</strong>?</li>
<li><strong>what is the downside</strong>? what could go wrong? we rarely an do this one by ourselves because we’re irrationally emotional and optimistic about the thing we are deciding about.</li>
<li><strong>can I live with the downside</strong>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risks don’t cease to exist just because you ignore them, and neither do facts. An honest assessment of what could go wrong, the probability of it going off the rails, and the cost in the event of failure are fundamental to minimizing your dumb tax.</li>
<li>Thinking about 2nd-order consequences minimizes the probability of a double bogey. Mistakes are inevitable, but double bogeys are usually avoidable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create the Machine</strong> - Create the executable plan and identify the resources (people and money) required to solve the real (core) problem and make forward progress.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoes that don’t fit are not a bargain at any price. A good idea that can’t be executed is a bad idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>. Ultimately, the problem gets addressed or solved as a result of a machine that will move me from Point A (where I am) to Point B (where I want to go). The expectation is that the new machine will produce an output that improves my situation, closes the gap, and moves me closer to the desired outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regardless of the change, management must shift priorities if the new solution has a shot at being effective. Changes in priorities are always accompanied by changes in the allocation of resources. The vast majority of solutions (machines) fail to produce the anticipated outcomes because management is unclear about the required shifts in focus, human capital, and money.</li>
<li>Measurement is THE key to sustainability and a culture of accountability.</li>
<li>finding the dash of paprika (tiny mistake) that is ruining your pie requires careful thinking and close observation.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Designing a Thinking Time process that works for you will be no different than figuring out any other ritual you want to create. The time of day, the best location, and the optimum duration are all discovered through practice and experimentation until you have created a Thinking Time process that best supports your outcomes. The key here is to obsess about obtaining the outcomes and not about finding the perfect process!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>step by step process/structure for each Thinking Time sessions</p>
<ul>
<li>great thinking time session requires a great question as the launching pad. Prior to my thinking time session, I will create and write down a question(s) I want to think about.
<ul>
<li>create 3 to 5 questions that focus on a common thread or concern.</li>
<li>sometimes, during actual thinking time session, change only 1 or 2 words in a querstion to see if I can get a different insight into the issue I’m thinking about.
<ul>
<li>For example, the original question might be: “Who is my target market?”, might change this to “Who as my target market”, I could tweak this question to: “Who is my competition’s target market” that question could easily change to: “If I was starting again today, what market would I target?” I could add this question: “If I wanted to double my sales, what market would I target” This might morph into: “Why aren’t my sales double what they are right now in the market I am currently targeting?”</li>
<li>optimizing for possibilities (more questions, more possibilities) not completion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>clear calendar for 60 minutes, which will enable me to think for about three-quarters of an hour and then evaluate/sort the solutions and ideas I identified in the last 15 minutes or so</li>
<li>3 possible scenarios for Thinking Time questions
<ul>
<li>create new question</li>
<li>revisit a prior question that could use additional thought.</li>
<li>use an answer from prior Thinking Time session as the basis for refining/fleshing out/changing the original question and searching for additional possible choices or variations on the theme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for most of the questions, one Thinking Time session is insufficient,
<ul>
<li>it’s hard to focus more than about 40 minutes</li>
<li>usually think about same question in multiple Thinking Time sessions (2-3 is not uncommon) before finding out elegant answer that is worthy of execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>close the door, turn off the phones, and eliminate all noise and visual distractions. I sit in my chair (which does not face my computer or a window, where too many distractions and temptations pop up), question, pen, and big chief tablet in hand</li>
<li>set a timer on my computer alerts me when my Thinking Time has expired and keeps me from fidgeting and looking at my watch.</li>
<li>right before I start, I sip my water, scratch what itches, go to the bathroom, clear my throat, and then sit perfectly still. I have found over the years that my body has the power to derail my thinking and break my concentration. To optimize the thinking process, I must lose touch with my body so that my train of concentration is totally uninterrupted. During my Thinking Time, I’m totally motionless except for my right hand, which is recording my thoughts.</li>
<li>this is a creative process and not intended to be filtered or judged. If I hit a blank or gap in which nothing is flowing (or my mind starts wandering), I will silently re-ask myself the question I’m working on during the particular session. I might also silently ask myself,
<ul>
<li>what else could it be?</li>
<li>what could I do that would make this problem worse?</li>
<li>how would my competition solve this problem?</li>
<li>if I got fired and a new CEO took over, what decision would she make?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I remind myself that I’m looking for ideas and possibilities, not perfection and absolutes. I attempt to avoid judging my ideas. The more judgment I have about an idea during the actual Thinking Time process, the less creative and more prejudiced I tend to be.</li>
<li>remarkably, I have found my better ideas tend to emerge during a pattern known as the “third third” The first third of my ideas on any given day are typically the obvious ones. The second third are variations on the first third. But the last third tends to be the most robust and frequently are where the juice is found.</li>
<li>At the conclusions of 40-45 minutes of Thinking Time. I will always take at least 15-20 mins to read what I have written and capture the best ideas I have uncovered (usually no more than 3)</li>
<li>the key is to connect the dots, not just collect more dots. I have a separate file in which I keep my best ideas, insights, and distinctions. These ideas can become the basis for a future Thinking Time session or might need to marinate for a few days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Learning doesn’t happen until something changes.</li>
<li>Business is complex and the future is unknown. Tactical solutions, simplistic formulas, and generalized answers tend to cripple rather than enhance success. No one has all the answers and nobody can predict the future, including me. Whatever you do, don’t drink my Kool-Aid, either. On the other hand, don’t ignore what I’m saying. Do some independent thinking for a change. Just because someone has written a book doesn’t mean he knows what he’s talking about. The same holds true for me.</li>
<li>Be careful who you take advice from. Are they really an expert, or just someone with an opinion and a publisher? be suspicious of one size fits all solutions. Your situation is likely to be unique and require some serious brainpower to sort out the core problems and possible solutions. Be distrustful of advisors who predict the future</li>

<ul>
<li>If your dream is to become rich in business, then mastering business skills is compulsory. Notice I did not say, “Improving your product or becoming a better plumber is compulsory.” There’s a big difference between winning the gold medal as the best plumber in the world</li>
</ul>
<p>(artistic and operational achievement) and winning the gold medal of making $1,000,000/year of bottom line profit as the Owner of a plumbing business (business success).</p>
<ul>
<li>Believing passion and operational excellence will trump business skills and risk assessment is a guaranteed prescription for a breathtaking dumb tax.</li>
<li>The victim mentality of the what-you-see-is-what-you-get worldview is the perfect excuse to let you off the hook for taking responsibility for your business’s outcomes and results. Don’t let it. If you want business success, then learn the necessary business skills and tools. There</li>
</ul>
<p>is no such thing as a rich victim.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the success of every business there are 4 different roles that must be played or present: Artist (Creator), Operator (Technician), Owner (Business), and Board (Investor)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every new business always starts with the artist/creator hat or the operator/technician hat. For the former you are usually passionate about a new idea and you feel very pumped to take it to the world, while the latter usually has a skill and wants to showcase it to the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the primary crisis of most start-ups and small businesses is usually cash, traction, or operational structure, any one of which causes the Owner (Business) and Board (investor) roles to be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The honest truth is that as the business grows the required skills to hone are the skills to run a business which include; talent management, reading financial statements, creating dashboards, allocating resources, measuring outcomes, leveraging, delegating duties etc. These skills and many more are the skills needed to take the business from the artistic and operator mindset to the mindset of a business owner, where the business really grows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that these four hats are always needed at different times throughout the life cycle of any business. You use/wear them as the need arises in your business and it allows you see he business from different angles/sides and make better informed business decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a hat for each role equips you to think about your business as a whole rather than just a set of discrete activities that must be performed –Keith Cunningham</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never allow these Hats (Artist, Operator, Business Owner, Investor) to define who you are or your ability. Its just a way of thinking that you switch to when needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These hats are interchangeable at will but require different mindsets and skills that must be brought to bear in running your business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./4-hats-business.png">4 hats of business</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Artistic Hat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He has a creative mindset and would always want to make changes to the product or service.</li>
<li>They fall into the trap that the better they get at their craft, the better they are accepted in the market place and therefore more money.</li>
<li>Companies like Mcdonalds have long left the artistic hat, in other words the taste of the burger has remained the same but the system of producing the burger has constant improvement among other things.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, growth and control work inversely. The more growth you desire, the less control you can have (and vice versa).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operator Hat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These people are enormous hard workers and they believe in adding value through time and  effort.</li>
<li>They believe that the harder you work, the more money they make, which isn’t totally true.</li>
<li>They are crisis leaders who apply tactics rather than strategy.</li>
<li>Fire fighters instead of fire preventers</li>
<li>They don’t run the business; rather the business runs them,</li>
<li>more often than not, when operator-drive business fail, it is because the operator has died of exhaustion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business Owner Hat</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are usually engaged and involved in the planning, execution, measurement, and  corrections necessary to proactively lead and manage the business and employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An owner puts systems and structures in place to keep the company afloat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They focus on leverage to grow the business and are brutal about dashboards because it helps with measurements, accountability, meeting deadlines and delivering results. They use the above to run the business end of the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They also use the power of delegation to allocate resources where needed to grow the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually the CEO that takes this role</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Board (Investor) Hat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is similar to the Business owners mind set and focuses more on strategy and growth.</li>
<li>the key attributes are the abilities to question, probe, think sequentially, substitute rational thought for emotion, anticipate crisis, predict 2nd-order consequences, and identify risks.</li>
<li>The majority of dumb taxes incurred are a direct result of having only one voice in the conversation when the original decision was made. Adding experienced, wise, thoughtful, trustworthy voices to the conversation exposes risks, curtails faulty assumptions, and minimizes stupid.</li>
<li>a board of directors serves as a coach/trusted advisor to the CEO. How members of the board think and what they think about is something every CEO/Owner should emulate, whether or not they have a formal Board. The vast majority of large, successful companies added a board of directors early in their trajectory. Filling this vital role is an integral part of the journey that must be traveled to avoid misguided, overly enthusiastic, irrational lurches that create dub tax and slow value creation and growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Its usually filled by a group of people that are not involved in the day to day activities of the business but rather have an outside-in look into the business.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Their purpose is to expose pit falls and curtail faulty assumptions and steer the company away from making costly mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to Keith Cunningham, The single best business decision you will ever make is to intentionally work with a peer group on a regular basis to question assumptions, ask hard questions (the kind you hope nobody will ask), alert you to icebergs, raise the bar, and push and hold you accountable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In summary. The Artist creates it, the Operator does it, the Business owner leads the team and the investor protects the business and keeps it alive,</p>

<li>if my business could talk, what would it say?</li>
<li>which hat has been my comfort zone and which hats are not getting worn often enough? For that matter, which hats do I not even own, and how can I acquire them?</li>

<li>what skills or tools do I need to learn (or who do I need to hire) to help me overcome the obvious obstacles that are restricting my growth, sales and profitability?</li>
<li>what ares of my business could be delegated (or outsourced) to someone else (who is competent and has execution intelligence) to free me up to do the things that would add the most value?</li>
<li>Artist Hat: What needs to be created?</li>
<li>Operator Hat: What needs to be done …today?</li>
<li>Owner Hat: What needs to be structured? Measured? Planned? Delegated?</li>

<ul>
<li>The key to a great culture is creating and fostering a never-ending conversation about the “rules of the game.” The rules define the boundaries or guardrails so that everyone knows exactly how to act, how to communicate, and how to treat each other. Culture, not a value statement, is the key to high performance and becoming the employer of choice. (Enron’s Value</li>
</ul>
<p>Statement was Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence. A plaque on the wall is not a substitute for culture, and neither are nap rooms.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anyone who says customers are #1 has lost their mind! Employees are #1. Employees are the source of all value creation. Culture (not jelly beans in the kitchen) is the source for engaged, turned-on employees. Show me a disinterested employee and I’ll show you a lousy culture, a weak leader, and a poor customer experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you’re about to initiate a cultural shift, be aware of these three common culture saboteurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iceberg #1: Deciding to change the culture within your business is not an initiative for the weak of heart or uncommitted. Creating and sustaining a world-class culture is an ongoing but immensely rewarding initiative. It lowe4rs turnover, improves efficiency, and makes the business a good place to work.</li>
<li>Iceberg #2: There is always at least one person on a team who thinks he is immune to the culture transformation conversation.</li>
<li>Iceberg #3: An unenforced rule is not a rule; it’s a suggestion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason we hesitate to have the hard conversations is because we don’t care enough. If you truly cared enough, you would say what needs to be said. After all, how else are they going to improve and maximize their potential? Let me remind you that nothing can change until the unsaid is spoken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to understand what culture is, let’s begin with what it’s not:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not a mission, value, or vision statement plaques we hang up on our company wall.</li>
<li>The coddling of employees; e.g nap rooms, concierge to pick up the dry cleaned clothes of the employees, stocking the kitchen with red bull, spa coupons for employees,</li>
<li>Sad to say that the above DOES NOT drive culture, it rather drives an entitlement mentality in your employees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Culture is result-oriented…getting stuff done is at the core of any organization’s culture. It’s the guard rails or guiding principles by which everyone must live by. It is ingrained in the heart and soul of the business (employees and employers). It is woven into the very fabric of the organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Keith’s words “Culture is how we treat each other, how we talk to each other, whether or not we trust each other, and how we handle conflict. Culture is about accountability, measuring, a bias for urgency, a focus on solutions, calling it tight—saying what needs to be said—being kind and generous, acknowledging one another, and expressing appreciation.</p>

<p>accountability. (A Board of Directors is great at filling this role.)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Business success is highly dependent on who you hire and who you don’t fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Motivation is for amateurs. Pros never need motivating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show me a lousy culture and I will show you a lousy CEO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key is the clarity on the obstacle and consistency of disciplined execution on the critical drivers. Consistency requires measurement. Discipline requires standards. Execution requires resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are 7 yardsticks that a CEO must be judged by to consistently produce quality results:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clearly define Point A and Point B</strong>: Most CEOs or leaders are every good in articulating where they are going to (Point B) or what you might call the vision. Its funny how most CEOs give a stunning presentation of the future they don’t have 100% control of but find it hard to determine where they are now (Part A); their present state. I honestly think that its only natural to know where we are going to after you know where you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Determine the obstacle”</strong> This is only gotten when there is a clear definition of point A and point B. This obstacle is also known as the gap. This is the reason why you haven’t attained or achieve point B. At this stage you must separate the problem from the symptom and focus on the real problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design the plan/machine:</strong> After you have clearly defined point A and B, the obstacle or gap, then the next thing is to build a machine that will address the problems above. At this stage , the CEO can delegate at this stage or get his team members to be part of this so that they can also own it and run with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allocate resources:</strong> Once you determine the solution/machine to be used, the next thing is to allocate the adequate resources to make the machine work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just like Keith Cunningham said “A shift in priorities without a simultaneous shift in resource allocation is delusional. Anytime we announce new initiatives or change priorities, it requires a change in how we are allocating our resources (team, time, and money) must be allocated in such a way that permits the business to stay afloat while trying to birth and execute this new initiative or idea with this new machine. It also requires that we do less of one thing to allow us to do more of something else. None of us has the ability to keep adding without curtailing or stopping something else.”</li>
<li>Keith Cunningham says it perfectly “In other words, the CEO must plan tomorrow’s breakfast while continuing to cook tonight’s dinner.” This is very tricky and requires a good amount of skill to adequately execute this; you must know the effect of the reduction of resources in order to increase it for another task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Team players:</strong> This is so crucial to the workings of the machine. Machines don’t operate themselves, they need people to run it. The quality of the output of the machine is directly proportional to the quality of the team players. So it’s very important that everyone on your team brings their A-game to bear on the task at hand. Mediocrity should never have a place in your team. The watchword here is “ Mastery”. Just like Keith Cunningham said “Said another way, business success is highly dependent on whom you hire and whom you don’t fire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are some tips to distinguish A players include:
<ul>
<li>They have a scoreboard that helps them with measurements. They will not play if they can’t see the scoreboard</li>
<li>They love healthy competition.</li>
<li>They love accountability.</li>
<li>they have the technical chops to do the job. This is not their first rodeo. They have been there, done that, and they are technically very good at what they do.</li>
<li>They are humble enough to ask for coaching. The 3 most important questions an employee can ask are
<ul>
<li>what else can I do</li>
<li>where can I get better?</li>
<li>what do I need to do or learn so that I continue to grow?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They are good at what they do and always seek to get better.</li>
<li>They see opportunities, while others see problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>rules for hiring and retaining A players are
<ul>
<li>interview rigorously</li>
<li>compensate generously</li>
<li>onboard effectively</li>
<li>measure consistently</li>
<li>coach continuously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>build the organization chart/structure:</strong> This cannot be overemphasized. It’s one of the differences between good companies and great companies. People or personnel must operate within a structure also known as the organizational chart. A structure gives support and provides protection to your business. Most importantly, the structure must be outcomes/result oriented instead of roles, titles, or names. In other words, every role must have tasks, outcomes, and deliverables that are assigned to people, and excuses for non or under-performance are not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a culture:</strong> Culture is a way of life. As a CEO, whatever you put in place as a culture will run into the fabric of your business. You must show that you are accountable, you care, and have a deep desire for success. You cannot have a culture that is not practiced. A culture that is not upheld is a mere vision or mission plaque that you hang on the wall.</p>
<ul>
<li>how people talk to each other and treat one another is the essence of culture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>in light of 7 fundamental jobs of a CEO, where have I dropped the ball and what do I need to do differently to cause us to get better</li>
<li>as I’m thinking about the next 100 days and what I will do differently, what are the things, I must do less of to make room for the things I need to do more of?</li>
<li>if my team represents my leverage, what do I need to do or say to ensure their success?</li>
<li>starting and perfection are rarely simultaneous. What are the 3 things I could begin doing that would get me 80% of the way there?</li>
<li>what is the disipline I need to adopt to create the outcomes I want?</li>
<li>what is my specific measurable plan to improve our results?</li>
<li>where have I abdicated my responsibilities as a CEO and what do I need to do about it?</li>
<li>where have I optimized for easy instead of outcomes?</li>
</ul>

<li>The best time to learn the lessons (and avoid the dreaded dumb tax) is prior to making the mistake in the first place.</li>
<li>Making mistakes is inevitable; admitting them and learning the lesson is optional. I love what Dr. Buckminster Fuller said about this: “A mistake is not a sin unless it is not admitted.”</li>
<li>The tougher the times, the better the people you need. There is no way to survive a bad market with weak people.</li>
<li>Paying for overhead we don’t need to support revenue we don’t have is stupid.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of rules, skepticism, and discipline caused every  mistake we made.</li>
<li>Emotions, when mixed with unbridled greed and easy access to capital, produce economic disasters.</li>
<li>Financial engineering and incremental debt do not turn a bad deal into a good one.</li>
<li>Raw land eats three meals per day.</li>
<li>Catching a big wave is not the same as being a good swimmer.</li>
<li>There is no way to correct without divorcing the story and marrying the truth. Facts do not cease to exist just because you ignore them. A good market tends to hide mistakes. Nothing takes the place of being actively engaged in the running of your business and being thoughtful (as well as skeptical) about the future.</li>
<li>Last week’s marketing report has absolutely nothing to do with where the market is headed, what the economy is doing, or what the demand will be next year.</li>
<li>How you run your business during the good times is the only true predictor of how well your business will cope with the bad times.</li>
<li>You must keep a conservative strategy during the good times because you generally don’t know you’re in bad times until it’s too late.</li>
<li>No team has ever won the game with an “offense only” strategy. Great teams, the ones who win championship rings, all have fantastic defenses. They think about prevention, protection, and risks.</li>
<li>Not all progress is measured by ground gained; sometimes progress is measured by losses avoided.</li>
<li>Speed kills. True wealth is built slowly. Speed and greed necessitate aggressive leverage and increase the odds of catastrophe. It is better to go slower and avoid the do-overs.</li>
<li>Our desire for growth and size was based on ego and greed, not strategy and wealth.</li>
<li>The successful people we admire are not the ones who made it. We admire the ones who kept it.</li>
<li>Owners MUST be hands-on and involved in every aspect of the business.</li>
<li>We acted like it was a sin to miss a revenue opportunity. That makes as much sense as needing to eat everything at a Sunday buffet.</li>
<li>Do not be afraid to say “no.” Saying “yes” does not always equal more.</li>
<li>It’s delusional to believe our ability, intellect, and work ethic can overcome a bad market.</li>
<li>Litigation is expensive, time-consuming, and to be avoided.</li>
<li>The best way to avoid losses and to stay financially healthy is to “sell too soon.” The old real estate maxim “In the history of the world, the seller is always wrong” is outrageously stupid when you run out of cash!</li>
<li>Don’t fall into the trap of believing you can sell it for a higher price tomorrow. The future is unknown (and unknowable) and fraught with risk.</li>
<li>In the future, I would rather miss an opportunity than lose capital. .Never buy something because you think you might need it someday. .Keep working all your alternatives until something closes. It hasn’t closed until the money is in the bank.</li>
<li>Success does not make you invincible or bulletproof. What success does best is make you complacent and egotistical, which by themselves are sufficient to create disaster.</li>
<li>The euphoria of a hot market usually results in ignoring marketplace fundamentals. Prudently gathering and evaluating market-based economic information is the only prescription for avoiding the mistake of smoking your own exhaust.</li>
<li>Never delay taking corrective action once the problem has been recognized. Hoping for better conditions in the future so the problem will solve itself is a fool’s game. Procrastination magnifies problems. •Failure to recognize reality is delusional. You might be smarter and better than your competition, but when the market shifts, you’re still broke. Don’t confuse intellect with economic reality.</li>
<li>Never rely on only your consultant’s recommendations. If you don’t understand it, don’t do it.</li>
<li>We did not narrow our focus when we knew times were getting worse. This was due to two things: (1) The distraction of our prior track record, and (2) An unwillingness to assess the risks of being wrong.</li>
<li>A small percentage of a large number is a large number.</li>
<li>Any fool can make money in the good times.</li>
<li>The question should never be, “Should I pursue this opportunity?” The right questions are:</li>
<li>If I pursue this opportunity, how much time, resources, effort, and investment are required?</li>
<li>Is this in my wheelhouse (core competence)?</li>
<li>What could go wrong?</li>
<li>What are the returns if I am right and the costs if I am wrong? . Can I live with being wrong?</li>
<li>The greater the past success, the greater the likelihood of the Superman fantasy. A lack of cash or cash flow is Kryptonite and it kills all superheroes. Always be skeptical and keep some powder dry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Doing a deal to keep the staff busy is stupid. Do not do marginal deals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bad economy doesn’t create financial problems; it just reveals them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost everything takes longer than you think it will and costs more than originally budgeted. Plan for delays and bumps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just because prices have gone up the last several years doesn’t mean they can’t go down 30% next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The easiest sale is to an employee or a consultant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the market is bad, there are NO buyers… at any price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delaying the decision to sell today because last year’s prices were higher or because the anticipated profits originally projected were greater is stupid. The market doesn’t care about either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not follow the market down. Make deep cuts quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t let what your competition is doing influence your decisions. You can’t erect a fence to keep the competition out. Besides, they do stupid things sometimes too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary locations always decline the fastest (and most) and take the longest to return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New projects must be based on current demand and not future growth. •You do not have to swing at every pitch that is thrown. Do fewer, better deals. Not only will you optimize the results of the superior deals, you will also have far less overhead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too many deals consume time and draw attention away from the really good ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It takes three good deals to make up for one bad deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a bad deal surfaces, 90% of management’s time is siphoned off from the rest of the business to deal with the problems it generates. The result: The bad one is still bad and the good ones are now mediocre or troubled as a result of a lack of attention. Ninety percent of management’s time should be spent on nurturing the good ones. Easy to say, hard to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding off on adjusting the price or overhead based on the belief the market will rebound quickly is irrational.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Debt gives the illusion of wealth. True wealth is assets, cash flow, and manageable (minimal) debt.</li>
<li>Excessive debt and hope are the root of all financial crises. You can never ignore risks or suspend doubt.</li>
<li>Doing a marginal deal just because the money is available is stupid. Bankers typically can’t assess the market risks either.</li>
<li>Take your personal guarantee seriously. You only bring two things to the table: cash and your guarantee, neither of which has an unlimited supply.</li>
<li>Don’t rely on future price increases to make a deal work. .Never finance long-term assets with short-term debt.</li>
<li>We covered a lot of mistakes with access to an abundance of money and easy credit.</li>
<li>Too much money makes you stupid. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.</li>
<li>Stretching to do a deal by horsing the numbers in a spreadsheet is usually a sign of ego and rarely a good idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personnel</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bench strength is critical. Find the best people and compensate them VERY well. It saves money in the long run.</li>
<li>The tougher the times, the better the people you need. There is no way to survive a bad market with weak people.</li>
<li>Adding/keeping mediocre people weakens the organization, which dilutes your results.</li>
<li>Always be upgrading your talent and never be afraid to pay them what they need to make.</li>
<li>Every hire we make should raise the average.</li>
<li>One superstar 7-footer is far more valuable than ten 5-footers. Weak people beget weak results.</li>
<li>Never wait to address personnel issues or substandard performance. Employees are either doing a great job or they aren’t. If they aren’t, take action. My job isn’t to babysit or beg people to do their jobs.</li>
<li>The cost of tolerating an incapable or misplaced employee is far greater than the discomfort of having a tough conversation and speedy termination.</li>
<li>A culture rooted in past successes, growth at all costs, and aggressive bonus structures will produce employees who don’t think, who aren’t skeptical, and who ignore risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overhead</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stay lean even if you can afford to get fat. Keep overhead low! •Watch your cash VERY closely. Ask yourself, “Do I really need this? Will this help me make more money?” Once the money is spent, it’s gone forever.</li>
<li>Get really sober (medieval) on what needs to happen to your cost structure to produce the profits you want vs. the revenue you hope to get.</li>
<li>Each line item of your financials should be scrutinized on a continuous basis to make sure the money is being spent in a productive and prudent way.</li>
<li>Conserve cash, especially during the good times. Spending money to look like a big deal is not the same as being a big deal.</li>
<li>When you’re out of cash, you’re out of business. Cash is truly KING.</li>
<li>When the market shifts, you can’t cut overhead fast enough.</li>
<li>it is easy to overpay or beef up when the world is viewed from only an upside perspective.</li>
<li>Cut overhead early and hard. Pride and hubris kept us from cutting our overhead in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Fancy offices, hot cars, lots of staff, and high overhead are signs of significance, not success.</li>
<li>Knowing your numbers-what it costs to run each aspect of your business and having timely information are critical to success.</li>
<li>Focus on the costs of doing business and not just the revenue potential.</li>
<li>Paying for overhead we don’t need to support revenue we don’t have is stupid.</li>
<li>Contract out as much of the work as possible. Keep overhead low and variable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As I look back at my most significant losses, stupidest decisions, and biggest mistakes, what are the fifty most important lessons I have learned?</li>
<li>Where am I making some of these same mistakes again?</li>
<li>Based on prior lessons learned, what do I need to change</li>
</ul>
<p>(immediately) to avoid the dreaded dumb tax?</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the rules and disciplines I will put in place to minimize the likelihood of repeating my mistakes?</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Ordinary things, consistently done, produce extraordinary results! Think about the discipline of consistently reviewing your prior month’s financial statements by the 10th of every month. In a matter of a quarter or two, the insights and optics harvested will change the priorities and decision making in your business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To get good at doing stuff, you must be ready to practice, be prepared to make a lot of mistakes. As a matter of fact, the faster you make the mistake and correct it the better for you. <strong>SO FAIL FAST</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s not just practice that makes perfect, but the deliberate intensity of your practice will determine the speed of your progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Keith’s words “ordinary things done consistently will produce extraordinary results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of wrong decisions are made on the premise of instant gratification…you expect a big deal to make the change on your financial distress instead of working your way out of the distress which takes time. The good thing about working your way out of the distress is that you will likely not make that mistake again, thereby giving you a success path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing expectation is an essential element of business success. When not managed well you are likely to kill your dreams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to figure out how to immediately solve a problem in one fell swoop is stupid. I might not have the final “Holy Grail” solution to all my problems, but what are five things I can do immediately to improve my situation?</li>
<li>Where am I inconsistently executing the right thing?</li>
<li>Where am I not practicing with the level of intensity I know I am capable of?</li>
<li>Where are we practicing but not correcting or getting the coaching that would give us insights about what we can do better? • Where am I consistently executing the wrong thing?</li>
<li>Where have I allowed the need for instant gratification to become a substitute for picking up the business end of a shovel and consistently breaking a sweat?</li>
<li>What are three outcomes we previously set but have abandoned because of unrealistic expectations or inconsistent execution? Should any of these outcomes be resuscitated and reprioritized with the accompanying realistic plans, resources, and time frames?</li>
<li>What are three bad habits/business practices we have tolerated that are undermining our results?</li>
<li>What are the decisions I must make and</li>
</ul>
<p>-he hard conversations I must have to break these bad habits once and for all?</p>
<ul>
<li>How will I adjust my behavior to create the success/outcomes I envision?</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Start with what customers want. Start with their needs, desires, and pain. Start with the gap between the solutions being offered by the competition and where they (the customers) are frustrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this chapter, Keith describes a story where he interrogates his wife on how he can be of better husband to her. Most importantly, what she wants/desires in a relationship. He starts with what she wanted in a relationship and she replies “I want to be Loved and Adored”. This was her goal. Then he went on to ask her “Now, tell me everything that needs to happen and exactly what it would look like for you to feel loved and adored.” For almost an hour and a half he kept on writing the answers to that question. He wondered why she wanted all this but iis what she wanted. Period. Even though he didn’t have the passion for it, he was ready to do everything he could make it happen. He even asked what happens if he forgets, she smiled and said I will remind you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s pause here and think for a moment and analyze the story.</p>
<ul>
<li>He asked her for her goal, and she verbalized it.</li>
<li>He then asked her what success means to her by asking “Now, tell me everything that needs to happen and exactly what it would look like for you to feel loved and adored.” Her.e he wanted her to verbalize what she actually wanted in plain language.</li>
<li>He was also committed to make it happen even though he didn’t have the passion for it.</li>
<li>As a business owner, you must always find out what the customer wants. You are in business because of the customer. The mistake most people make is to create the product and then look for the customer. Here you find out what their pain points, needs and most importantly what success means to them?</li>
<li>Once you have gotten their needs and pain points, the next thing is to find a solution that meets their need and their success proposition</li>
<li>Finally, your service/product delivery must be out of this world and exceptional. If this is not done well, you will jeopardize all the hard work you have put in the creation of the product. You are likely not to come back to a restaurant that had crappy service no matter how good the food tastes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>principles to attract customers and gain significant traction in any business</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FOWTW:</strong>: find out what they want. This is anticipating problems, identifying pain points, and discovering needs. what do customer want?</li>
<li><strong>GAGI:</strong> go and get it. build solutions for the problem/pain/need identified. Can I get them what they want?</li>
<li><strong>GITT:</strong> give it to them. This is how you deliver a solution… the experience and execution. how do I deliver to them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To conclude, I would like to borrow these words from Peter Drucker that says when the marketing is done right, selling becomes unnecessary. And his definition of marketing? Finding out what customers want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What do our customers want and how do I know that this is the right answer?</li>
<li>What is the solution I need to design to meet their needs and address their pain?</li>
<li>Do I have the ability (skill sets and resources) to successfully build this solution?</li>
<li>How will I deliver it to them?</li>
<li>What is the experience these customers want?</li>
<li>What exactly is the gap between where customers are frustrated and what the competition is doing?</li>
<li>Where can we find pockets of target customers who are frustrated with our competition?</li>
<li>Where is the competition weak or deficient in delivering the outcomes, solutions, and value the market demands?</li>
<li>What should we be doing to communicate to potential customers that we are the aspirin for their pain?</li>
<li>What are the three primary problems (pains) my target market has?</li>
<li>Where have I substituted my judgment for what I want to deliver for what the customers actually want to receive?</li>
<li>How could I check in with our customers?</li>
</ul>

<p>“Fix the problem and not the blame” is a statement that stands out for me and is also synonymous to treating the symptoms instead of treating the problem. Most times as business owners we tend to fall into the trap of managing instead of coaching. Leaders coach while managing usually takes the form of a sheriff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A coach sets the rules/guard rails and then guides you to your success while a sheriff sets the same rules and reprimands/punishes you for unmet expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leaders usually have employees that have ownership of the jobs and understand that doing the work means keeping the job, while employees of a manager usually operate from fear of being punished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leaders always make sure that there is communication such that the employees have a clear understanding of their job specification, understand their different tasks and if there is a grey area, they immediately call for help to get it solved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employees under a leader will comply as a result of ownership, communication and accountability while the employees under a manager are compliant as a result of fear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leaders have high performance teams because there is accountability, measurement and ownership, while managers have high maintenance teams that are working out of fear of being reprimanded/punished if they make mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, in the words of Keith Cunningham, “the two most important phrases used by leaders are: Help me understand and What do you recommend?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sample conversations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="text"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">Patty, I think I owe you an apology. Apparently we have done a poor job of
- Communicating what we want.
- Making sure you own the cleanliness of the lobby.
- Explaining why it is so important it be done a certain way.
- Providing you with the training you need for how to keep it clean.
- Tolerating what you have done in the past without giving you the appropriate coaching on how to do it better.

I am very sorry.

What we expect is for the lobby to be kept clean and tidy, which means the floors are continuously monitored, swept, and mopped, the loose newspapers are thrown out, and the customers' seats in the waiting area are clean and organized. This is not happening on a consistent basis and is obviously not happening right now.
I am confused. Help me understand why I am seeing a mess in our lobby this morning. I know we have discussed this with you several times in the past, yet here it is again. Is the problem that
- You don't understand what we want? 
- You haven't been adequately trained?
- You just don't care what the lobby looks like despite this being a critical part of your job?
- We just got slammed with a bunch of customers and there hasn't been time to clean this up yet?
- You don't understand the importance of this job and doing it the way we expect it to be done?
- You don't own your job and are unaware of the consequences of not doing the job you were hired to do?

Help me understand why this problem doesn't get fixed and stay fixed.</code></pre></div>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="text"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">Patty, you have a job here. To keep your job, you must do the work. The job and the work, hand go in hand. It has now reached the point that it feels like we are begging you to do the work, which makes no sense because you never have to beg me for your paycheck. Neither one of us wants to beg, and neither of us should have to. You are a smart woman; you understand what we expect. But, for some reason it isn't getting done consistently.
Here is what I know: When my effort to help you get better exceeds your effort to get better, this stops working for both of us.
It seems to me the problem might have something to do with what you believe. For this to continue to be a topic of conversation, maybe you hear what we want but mistakenly believe what we are requesting is optional. Perhaps you believe we are just kidding when we tell you keeping the lobby picked up and clean is part of your job. You might believe we will not notice or, if we do notice, maybe you believe we will not say anything. You might believe you can avoid doing your job and we will pay you anyway, or even give you a raise for not doing your job. Maybe you believe that you can keep your job but not do the work.
Help me understand what you believe about this.</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Opportunity without structure is chaos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No leverage, no long-term growth. The inevitable result is chaos and a gravitational pull toward the urgent. Leverage is the bridge that transitions the Owner of a business from Operator mode to Owner mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The price of entrepreneurial success is discipline and structure. Keith Cunningham put it very well, “Sometimes the problem we started out to solve mutates. If we miss the shift, we will try to solve the new problem using solutions for the old problem. Chances are, those old solutions for the previous problem are useless.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keith Cunningham defines Structure as designing, planning, and constructing the skeleton of the business so there is a foundation and support configuration to enable the business to profitably take advantage of the opportunities available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your business needs that structure to give it foundation, support and most importantly sustainable growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It stems from your core values, core focus and culture as the foundation and then the structure is built. It includes hiring right, to putting systems and processes in place, designing the machine (solution) or even the engine of the machine. Anything that puts some form of order and allows things to run smoothly is what makes up structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structure is what transcends you from working in your business to working on your business. It gives you the leverage to have a bird’s eye view of the business. In other words, it takes you from being an operator in the business to a business owner. It is structure that give you that leverage. Without it comes excess fatigue and frustration that in turn affects your customers and then takes your business on a steady decline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To end this, I would like to borrow Keith’s words that says: “Success is not an accident. Sustainable business success requires leverage, and one of the most critical forms of leverage available to a business Owner is the leverage of structure.”</p>

<p>When the environment radically changes and you are confronted with moments of uncertainty and danger, clinging to the old “right” way might seem like a good idea, but it can frequently be deadly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New circumstances always require new skills and tools, fresh training, innovative solutions, superior team members. The alternative (relying on past answers) is often a prescription for suffering and failure to survive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes the problem we started out to solve mutates. If we miss the shift, we will try to solve the new problem using solutions for the old problem. Chances are, those old solutions for the previous problem are useless.</p>

<p>One of the three men called Dodge used a technique called “escape fire” used by Indians when faced with similar challenges.

<p>These three noticed that the problem had mutated and they needed to think outside the box to survive.</p>

<ul>
<li>When it comes to goals, far too much emphasis is placed on visualizing Oz and not enough on designing and constructing the yellow brick road. Goals are not plans. Goals are ideas, and few things are dumber than executing on an idea with no plan or planning.</li>
<li>About the stupidest thing management can do is to announce some lofty goal for the year (“Our revenue target is $6,000,000 this year.”) without any thought about the working plan to attain it.</li>
<li>One of the hardest parts of designing the journey is being sober about reality and painstakingly honest about your current situation. Psychiatric hospitals are filled with people who are delusional about reality.</li>
<li>my life works to the degree I keep my commitments.</li>
<li>Don’t let your obsession with the dream get in the way of</li>
</ul>
<p>noticing the demand. Or as my friends on Wall Street say, “When the duck quacks, feed it.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being aware of the most common misconceptions and goal setting mistakes will help you avoid these pitfalls and minimize the likelihood of sabotaging the attainment of your desired outcomes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal setter’s focus is exclusively on the goal (Point B). Rarely is consideration given to the reality of where you are (Point A). In fact, one of the hardest parts of designing the journey is being sober about reality and painstakingly honest about your current situation.</li>
<li>The goal is typically little more than wishful thinking. So, we chant the magic goal-setting words with the expectation that this psychobabble verbal wizardry will create the desired outcome, even though there is no specific path, metrics, or specific, executable plan to achieve it. By tracking your effort you will immediately know whether your goals are really goals or simply fantasies.</li>
<li>The goal is not structured as a nonnegotiable but rather as a hope. We would all be better off if we had fewer goals and more standards. If the thing you want is important enough to set as a goal, why not make its attainment a nonnegotiable standard (a “must”) instead of a desirable aspiration (a “should”-thank you, Tony Robbins). When you boil it down, a should means doing the best you can; a must means doing whatever it takes. Said a different way: You get what you tolerate. .The vast majority of my goal-setting friends stumble at the beginning of the process because of a desire to dabble rather than burn the ships and commit. The emotional tug of continuing the search for an easier path or an early exit is hard to resist. My life works to the degree I keep my commitments.</li>
<li>The goal setter rarely has accountability on either the execution of the critical drivers required to move toward the goal or the ultimate attainment of it. This explains why the typical goal setter makes the same goals year after year. No one to hold them accountable.</li>
<li>Goal setters tend to fall in love with the goal instead of falling in love with the things that need to be done to accomplish the goal. In other words, they fall in love with the effect (goal) instead of the cause (critical drivers). If the critical driver for goal achievement were to want it bad enough or to visualize rays of sunshine emanating from your head, the human race would be rich, in a loving relationship and in great physical shape.</li>
<li>Often the goal setter compares her business to her friends’ or competitors’ to decide what goal to set, or she finds what’s wrong and fantasizes about what the business would be like if she was there and not here. In other words, this type of goal setting makes where she is bad (wrong) and what she wants good (right). Being critical or judgmental about your current conditions is a guaranteed way to create massive unhappiness. What I am suggesting is that a dose of gratitude be injected into the process, because everything is not “bad” We all have a long list of things to be grateful for. Never say, “It can’t get any worse,” because it can get a lot worse. I love H. Ross Perot’s definition of an entrepreneur: “Someone who is grateful for the progress that has been made and simultaneously dissatisfied with the rate they are making it.”</li>
<li>We know that having clarity on both Point A and Point B is critical to success. We also know that overcoming some obstacle that is preventing attainment of this outcome is fundamental to success. Amazon has been particularly adept at walking this fine line with its willingness to invest, make mistakes, learn, and adjust to match the demand in the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a look at where you are in your life today. Chances are these three things are true:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where you are today is beyond your wildest dreams compared to what you thought was possible when you were eighteen years old.</li>
<li>The route you took to get here was totally unpredictable from your vantage point as an eighteen-year-old.</li>
<li>The path that got you here was anything but linear or planned. If your life even remotely resembles mine, your path to this point is the most convoluted and tortuous route imaginable. Yet, here I am!</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When I think about the outcomes (goals) we have set for the coming quarter or year, where do I need to get clarity about my starting point in terms of environment, resources, competition, etc.?</li>
<li>Who can I ask to help me think through our reality so that I minimize the likelihood of tricking myself about our starting point or current capabilities?</li>
<li>What is the specific path/plan we have designed to move us from here to there, and what additional color or specificity do I need to add to this path to make it executable?</li>
<li>What would it take to transition our plans from “shoulds” (wouldn’t it be nice if…) to “musts” (failure is not an option)?</li>
<li>What are the hard decisions and actions I have been postponing in the irrational hope I can “goal” it away?</li>
<li>What are the nonnegotiable standards we must establish?</li>
<li>What am I tolerating in my business that is sabotaging my results or that is incongruent with my standards?</li>
<li>How do we build in the accountability required for the critical driver standards and outcomes we have committed to achieving?</li>
<li>What is the specificity I need to add to our plan so that everyone on the team has a clear, measurable metric (target) they are shooting for? • What are the specific causes I must identify that will enable the effect I want to happen?</li>
<li>What have we done well and what am I grateful for?</li>
<li>What are the unexpected opportunities that are being presented that might move us in the direction we want but don’t look the way we thought they would look? (Where is there a gaggle of quacking ducks?)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Leaders inspire…Managers control. To be successful in business, we need both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without a dashboard, you get a story. Dashboards tell you what you need to know, not what you want to believe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without coaching and consequences, good intentions and “the best I can” will become the excuse du jour. Without coaching and consequences, critical drivers and outcomes will become suggestions, not standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they [your employees] create it [the plan], they own it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot babysit your way to high performance and accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information is simply data that has been organized, which is the role of a dashboard. I need knowledge, not more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The specific measurable outcomes (or standards) you—as Owner/ CEO/leader-have prioritized for the business.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The primary obstacle that is prohibiting the forward progress from Point A (where you are) to Point B (where you would like to be). Clarity on this “gap” is critical to understanding the problem and converting the problem into an opportunity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The plan or strategy your team has created (with your adult supervision and input) to overcome this obstacle. The plan will also describe the resources required to execute the plan as well as the timelines, including milestones (interim targets) and delivery dates.</li>
<li>The process, machine, tactics, tasks, and executables required to put rubber on the road and to make actual sustainable progress. The key is identifying the specific resources, skills, training, processes, systems, equipment, best practices, and operations required to drive results.</li>
<li>The team of A players who have a high internal, emotional need to succeed, the requisite execution intelligence (been there, done that), and a scorecard to set performance standards of excellence. (Sweat, long hours, good intentions, likability, loyalty, and tenure are sorry excuses for results and equally pathetic benchmarks for employee evaluation and compensation.)</li>
<li>The critical drivers and standards that must be executed, measured, and analyzed to ensure the accurate and timely delivery of the outcomes. Critical drivers are the “causes” that, when consistently executed, produce the desired “effects.”</li>
<li>The great dashboards that display your critical driver results in a format that allows you and your team to have immediate optics. Regular comparison of the actual critical driver results produced against the benchmark standards established (and the trend line of these results) is critical to understanding where the opportunities are to adjust and correct the execution.
<ul>
<li>Without a dashboard, you get a story. Dashboards tell you what you need to know, not what you want to believe. Regular analysis is mandatory to establish reasons for the progress (or lack thereof) toward the stated outcomes and benchmark standards. Without the analysis, we have more data and information, but no knowledge about what to do differently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The regular, candid (sometimes difficult, many complimentary) accountability and coaching conversations with the team members to make the necessary corrections and adjustments. Without coaching and consequences, good intentions and “the best I can” will become the excuse du jour. Without coaching and consequences, critical drivers and outcomes will become suggestions, not standards.</li>

<li>Where (exactly) have we fallen short on the Big 8 and what (exactly) do I need to do to create the accountability and culture of high performance?</li>
<li>When I honestly evaluate our current progress, how much of my frustration is attributable to a miss on the Big 8 process? Where are the misses and what needs to be done now?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What are the few specific measurable outcomes I am optimizing for? (The clear, measurable target on the wall.)</li>
<li>What are the specific expectations I have about what these outcomes look like when they are achieved? (What does success look like… specifically?)</li>
<li>How do I successfully communicate these outcomes and create 100% clarity with my team about my expectations?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary Gap/Obstacle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the primary obstacle that is impeding our progress between Point A and Point B?</li>
<li>If this obstacle is so obvious, why haven’t we seen or addressed this obstacle previously? (Is this really the obstacle or is it a symptom disguising the real problem?)</li>
<li>What sacrifices will we need to make or risks we will need to take to overcome this obstacle?</li>
<li>By saying “yes” to solving this obstacle, what are we required to say “no” to?</li>
<li>If we are to be successful in overcoming this obstacle, what must we start doing and what must we stop doing?</li>
<li>What is the specific measurable gap between where I am and where I want to be?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy/Plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the specific plan that will serve as our road map and guide on closing the gap so that we always know where we are in relation to the desired outcomes and have clarity on what needs to be executed and corrected?</li>
<li>What are the specific measurable tasks that need to be performed to deliver these outcomes?</li>
<li>Who will perform these tasks?</li>
<li>What are the skill sets and execution intelligence required to perform these tasks?</li>

<p><strong>A Players</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the scorecard I have created for each person on the team? Without a scorecard to proactively measure and grade results and specific deliverables against a benchmark/standard, I have no ability to either grade or coach performance. <a href="#ceo-scorecard">CEO store card</a></li>
<li>In evaluating my current team, where have I settled and, therefore, produced mediocrity?</li>
<li>When I really look at the quality, capability, and performance of the people I have on my team, where is there an opportunity to reset expectations, train, upgrade, or replace?</li>
<li>Knowing what I now know, are there any people on my current team that I would not rehire… and what am I prepared to do about it? (Where are the weak links?)</li>
<li>What can I do to upgrade the quality of my choices for enhancing the number of A players on my team?</li>
<li>Since the team I have represents the vast majority of the leverage I enjoy, what needs to be done to guarantee their success?</li>
<li>Is part of the problem with my team a reflection of the culture I have created or tolerated? What are the changes I must make to our culture and how am I going to do that? (See both “Culture Is King (You Get What You Tolerate)” and “The Apology” for practical guidance on this topic.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critical Drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I know that what gets measured is what gets managed, so what are the three to five critical activities that must be performed and measured on a regular basis to ensure significant progress toward my standards and outcomes? (The chapter “Cause and Effect” will be extremely useful for you to reread in thinking about critical drivers.) • What are the specific measurable standards of performance I have for each critical driver activity?</li>
<li>I know that anyone who doesn’t want to measure doesn’t want to be held accountable, so what accountability metrics do I need to establish to assess our actual performance against our standards?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dashboards/Measuring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under the heading of transforming data into usable information that can be analyzed and provide me with valuable optics, what dashboard or scoreboard do I need to create and monitor so that I can easily see our progress on executing the critical drivers as well as achievement of our overall outcomes?</li>
<li>What dashboard would I need to create so that my team can look at it and know exactly where performance is deteriorating from prior time periods or in comparison to the standard?</li>
<li>Information is simply data that has been organized, which is the role of a dashboard. I need knowledge, not more information. The key to knowledge is analysis of the information. When I look at my dashboards, what are the insights and distinctions I can glean about our execution and performance in comparison to the standards we have set and outcomes we have prioritized?</li>
<li>What critical or interdependent relationships do I need to analyze to be able to see what is actually happening to sabotage our results?</li>
<li>Based on this analysis, what course corrections are needed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coaching/Consequences</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under the theory that nothing can change until the unsaid is spoken, what are the hard conversations I know I need to have but have avoided in my misguided desire to keep the peace or minimize the disruption of the status quo?</li>
<li>Where have I lowered my standards and tolerated mediocrity in my team’s performance?</li>
<li>Who needs the hard coaching and reset on expectations for deliverables or culture?</li>
<li>What are the clear consequences for missing the standards and outcomes we have set?</li>
<li>Since my employees do not need to beg for their paychecks, why do I constantly find myself begging them to do their job, and what do I need to do about this problem?</li>
<li>What can I do to consistently communicate my appreciation and acknowledgment for a job well done?</li>
</ul>

<p>. The only constant in business is change.
. The reason companies lose relevance, go broke, or fade into the sunset is because they continue to grow, but fail to evolve. They rely on the wrong questions and old answers. Great questions, an open mind, flexibility, and a healthy dose of paranoia are your best friends in business. No business is safe: 435 of the Fortune 500 (87%) from 1955 are now gone… disappeared… kaput. The business environment kept on changing requiring a different set of answers-and they didn’t come up with a better question. Stupid!</p>

<p>. When I see this kind of poor performance on a consistent basis, it can only be a result of one of four things:
. Incompetent and uncaring employees (This is a hiring and culture issue.)
.A lack of training
. No measurements or accountability
.A lack of supervision
.A discount for future services as compensation for poor performance
on past services is analogous to getting salmonella at a restaurant and the restaurant owner offering me a free dessert the next time I eat there. I already got sick from this ill-conceived trip, and your idea of helping me get over the food poisoning is to offer a token discount on my next trip?</p>

<p>• We make promises to ourselves, but we break them with alarming regularity. For some reason, promises we make to ourselves are less sacred than the promises we make to others. Having an accountability partner who will hold you to your commitments is a key ingredient to making sustainable progress and for success. Someone who will tell you the truth; someone who will not buy into your cheap excuses for why you fell off the wagon or didn’t get the job done; someone to tell you “no.”
.The higher you go or the better you want to get, the greater the requirement to have someone in your life who will hold you accountable and tell you the truth.</p>

<p>.The only things “small” has going for it are flexibility and intimacy of relationships.
• Survival requires more curiosity and less arrogance; more humility and less need to be right; better questions and fewer answers. SIMPLIFYING GROWTH
. The reason we gravitate to a tactical answer is because we are hardwired to get busy… to do something… to take action. The illusion we live with is that being active is synonymous with being productive. Dumb!
. Who do I want to buy from me?
. What must happen to cause them to buy?
. What must happen to keep them coming back?
• What could happen to cause them not to buy?</p>

• Business is not a bathrobe. One size does not fit all. Different problems in different environments for different people at different stages of development require different solutions. Never ask an encyclopedia salesman if you need an encyclopedia. He has the kind of one-size-fits all mentality that will wreck your business</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The 8 CEOs studied in the book far outperformed the S&#x26;P 500 over a 20-30 year period and this is attributed to their capital allocation strategies. All CEOs are investors AND managers, but the ‘investors’ part is typically ignored. As Buffett says, capital allocation is one of the most important tasks of a CEO, yet almost none of the people who rise to be CEOs are trained for it. They rise to the top based on their engineering, marketing, sales or other skills. This is analogous to a master musician being promoted to being Chairman of the Federal Reserve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The capital allocation toolkit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ways to deploy capital:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invest in existing operations</li>
<li>Acquire other businesses</li>
<li>Pay down debt</li>
<li>Issue dividends</li>
<li>Repurchase stock</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ways to raise capital:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap internal cash flow</li>
<li>Issue debt</li>
<li>Raise Equity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together, these 8 mechanisms form a tool-kit. Long-term returns provided by a company to its shareholders will depend heavily on how the CEO uses these 8 options. Companies with identical operating results and different approaches to allocating capital will lead to different outcomes for shareholders.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Free cash-flow, not earnings:</strong> Pay attention not to earnings, but cash-flow. Quarterly earnings reports are a distraction. This shapes company decisions including accounting policies.</li>
<li><strong>Clever buy/sell of own stock:</strong> Buy-back own company’s stock aggressively when it is running low and attractively priced. Use the stock to finance acquisitions or get cheap debt when the stock price runs high. Stock repurchases are a more tax-efficient method of returning capital to shareholders than dividends, which are taxed twice (corporate and individual level).</li>
<li><strong>Fly under the radar:</strong> Wall Street and the press are a distraction, ignore them. Great CEOs (as measured by return delivered in multiples over S&#x26;P 500) also avoid frequent magazine covers, interviews etc and fly under the radar.</li>
<li><strong>Anorexic HQ:</strong> Run decentralized operations, with rigorous budget monitoring. Headquarters should be ‘anorexic’, with only enough staff as absolutely needed to support the general managers of the various business units. The GMs are given utmost authority and autonomy.</li>
<li><strong>Traits as an investor:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concentration:</strong> “Be comfortable with concentration and buy only a few things that you understand well.”</li>
<li><strong>Patience:</strong> Be willing to wait long periods of time  (while the market complains about your inactivity), often a decade or more, for the right opportunity to emerge.</li>
<li><strong>Boldness:</strong> Each of the 8 CEOs made at least one acquisition or more that exceeded 25% of their firm’s enterprise value.</li>
<li><strong>Frugality &#x26; Tax Minimization</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Focus on ‘value per share’:</strong> Do not shy away from shrinking the company if that is the best move. Most of corporate America focuses on growth, these 8 CEOs focused on increasing ‘value per share’.</li>
<li><strong>Individualistic thinking:</strong> “Cut through the glare of peer activity and conventional wisdom to see the core economic reality and act accordingly.”</li>
<li><strong>To sum it up, their advantage relative to their peers was one of temperament, not intellect.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>Sign of a well-run great company: Diaspora are all over the industry. For Capital Cities, the alumni went to Disney (Bob Iger, CEO), Pulitzer (CEO). Dan Burke’s son Steve was COO of Comcast, followed by CEO of NBCUniversal.</li>
<li>Bought ABC, when it was 4 times bigger than Capital Cities. Warren Buffett helped finance the deal in exchange for a 25% stake in the combined company.</li>
<li>Most companies fall into the trap of a ‘prosperity blinded indifference to unnecessary costs’. CC executives remained focused on the core businesses.</li>
<li>Simple cycle that Tom Murphy used, which most people fail to remember or apply:
<ul>
<li>Look for attractive economic characteristics in a business or undertaking</li>
<li>Use whatever leverage you can apply to get that attractive business</li>
<li>Once you have it, improve operations.</li>
<li>Use the cash flow from the improved operations to pay down debt.</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The above practice today is known as a ‘roll-up‘. Many companies collapsed under the burden of bad roll-up debt – they acquired too rapidly and did not integrate and improve operations well.</li>
<li>Tom Murphy finally sold to Disney for an extraordinary $19 billion.</li>
<li><em>“Paint the two sides facing the road, leaving the other two sides untouched.”</em> – Murphy when asked to touch up a building for the advertisers who visited it.</li>
<li>Be frugal, but invest heavily where it is needed – every one of CC’s TV stations led in its region, because they invested heavily in the news talent and technology.</li>
<li>What employees and general managers said about CC – <em>“the system corrupts you with so much authority and autonomy that you cannot imagine leaving.”</em></li>

<li>While Teledyne’s own stock ran at P/E multiples in the 20-50 ranges, CEO Henry Singleton never bought companies with a P/E multiple higher than 12.</li>
<li>Great investors are able to sell high and buy low: Teledyne’s stock issuances happened at P/E multiples of ~25 and buybacks at around ~8.</li>
<li>Singleton, like Buffett designed an organization that allowed him to focus on capital allocations, not operations. Both viewed themselves primarily as investors, not managers.</li>

<ul>
<li>Bill Anders, CEO, had been the lunar module pilot on Apollo 8. <em>“After orbiting the moon, mundane business problems did not faze him.”</em></li>
<li>Anders’ turn-around strategy to exit all businesses with low returns, commodity businesses and ones which it did not know well. He systematically shrunk the company in an era where CEOs prided on size and growth.</li>
<li>Warren Buffett bought 16% of General Dynamics in 1992 after two years of observing Anders’ work.</li>
<li>Nick Chabraja, a successor, sold almost one-third of company stock to acquire GulfStream when GD was trading at 23 P/E multiples (history, was 16). This was counter-intuitive as such massive stock selling hadn’t happened before. <strong>The best capital allocators are opportunistic, practical and flexible. They are not bounded by strategy or ideology.</strong> Nick sold the stock at its highest P/E and got a company that provided almost 50% of the combined company’s cash flow.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ditch Wall Street’s metrics:</strong> John Malone at Tele-communications Inc was among the first to realize that the first among the cable operators to hit high scale would be able to lower programming costs and create a virtuous loop (higher subscribers, move leverage with content programming costs, lower costs imply more ability to buy subscribers..). This scaling would come at the expense at EPS, which was the holy grail of Wall Street.</li>
<li>It pays better to be a technology “settler” rather than a “pioneer” in traditional industries like cable – John Malone waited for other companies to test out the merits of a new technology before investing in it.</li>
<li>Comcast took until mid-1980s to realize this and switch from EPS-focused to growth-focused approach.</li>
<li>John Malone introduced the concept of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).</li>

<ul>
<li>Learnings from Dick Smith – recognize the strong, underlying demographic trends of your generation (sub-urban theatres would be beneficial in the 1960s) and then go after them trying to gain an advantage over others (used lease financing to expand theatres faster rather than buying land like everyone else was).</li>
<li>He repeated the same act with the beverage bottling businesses – recognizing that they would grow in the coming decade (1970s) and creatively growing them (financing via a sale/leaseback of the manufacturing facilities).</li>
<li>Be opportunistic and willing to make sizeable bets when the circumstances warrant it (the HBJ acquisition was 62% of General Cinema’s value at that time, but it was an attractive bet since they were buying a business at 6 times its cash flow. They would later sell it for 11 times the cash flow).</li>
<li>“It is remarkable how much value can be created by a small group of highly talented people.” – Spoken by a media investor about the General Cinema team.</li>

<li>Being part of the insider circles help – Buffett was friends with both Katharine and Tom Murphy of CC, so when FCC rules forced CC to divest some of its stations, the Washington Post got to take an exclusive look at the deal and they bought it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Until age 35, Warren Buffett ran a non-descript investment partnership out of Omaha. He did a ‘hostile takeover’ of Berkshire Hathaway, a 100-year-old but undifferentiated/unremarkable textile company based in MA.</li>
<li>Charlie Munger – <em>“Berkshire’s long-term success stems from its ability to generate funds at 3% and invest them at 13%.“</em></li>
<li>Advantage of being an outsider CEO (Buffett was an investment manager before Berkshire – he did not hesitate to divest the textile holdings when he did not see growth and good returns in the textile business) – <strong>you are not wedded to a particular business or industry.</strong> It is easier for you to exit businesses/industries with low returns and concentrate on those which are likely to meet their investment targets.</li>
<li><em>“Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.“</em></li>
<li>Buffett’s portfolio management philosophy: a high degree of concentration and extremely long holding periods.</li>
<li>Warren Buffett to students – your investments results will improve if, at the beginning of your careers, you are handed a 20 hole punch-card symbolizing the total number of investments you can make in your investing lifetimes.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Institutional Imperative” – this is the big-company/CEO equivalent of ‘teenage peer pressure.’ Buffett scorns this.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus the company on outcomes and results.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Establish clear and concise outcomes for the company and maintain an outcomes-based organization chart. Establish clear links between the company’s outcomes and an individual’s outcomes and results. Make sure each employee understands how they contribute to the company’s mission, outcomes, and results. Ensure that each leader, manager, and staff member has an outcomes-based scorecard that maps to the company’s outcomes and results. Plan and run meetings based on outcomes and results. Help design briefings, reports, agendas, and meeting materials that are focused on outcomes and results. Avoid allocating time to discussions of subjects such as activities, busyness, or hours worked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be strategic in your thinking and tactical in your actions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Being clear on the problem, obstacle, or gap to be bridged is critical, since solving the problem that isn’t is a waste of time and resources (and, to be candid, irritates me). Developing a specific plan to overcome this obstacle is critical; otherwise, we run the risk of running the wrong direction enthusiastically. Finally, being tactical in your actions puts rubber on the road and facilitates forward progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Always be willing to ask the question “What can I do today to improve our situation?”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not let perfect get in the way of possible. You might not have the final answer, but you can find two or three things to do to improve our current position. When in doubt, do these two or three things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preserve relationships.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It really is a small world, and what comes around goes around.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be good at being both kind and driven.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Address everyone with kindness and consideration regardless of the topic at hand, even if the topic is missed expectations or poor performance. Demonstrate the ability to remain focused on outcomes and results while doing so in a manner that is attractive to our leaders, managers, and staff. Run and participate in meetings in a manner that elicits input from everyone. React to input and ideas in a way that makes people glad they spoke up and leads them to speak again. Make it clear to everyone around you that you actively desire input, new ideas, and feedback and that it will be used to actually make the company better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be a master at delegation, and do not abdicate your leadership.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be efficient and effective by delegating an outcome or result rather than an activity or a task. Ensure that the person clearly understands the outcome and the time frame in which the result is expected. Determine if the person responsible for delivering an outcome understands how to produce the result by working closely with them to develop their achievement plan. Provide coaching or training if needed and conduct periodic progress sessions. Stay close to the delegated task and remain part of the success of its achievement. Work with the person so they understand and accept the reasoning behind the delegated outcome and why they received it. It is important that they understand this even if they disagree with being the recipient of the delegated outcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be physically present and involved.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get out of your office and spend face time with our staff. Get out of your office and spend face time physically with our customers. Make it a scheduled, embedded part of your calendar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attract, hire, develop, and retain only A players.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build our organization with A players. Demonstrate that you have proven ways to identify A-player talent and that you can teach this skill to other leaders. Demonstrate the ability to hire these A players into our company and how you can help them develop both personally and professionally. Show that you know how to retain this level of talent within our organization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thrive in a competitive market.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the competition as well as the marketplace (environment). Both change frequently. Understand our customers’ pains to avoid and gains to get criteria and how our business intersects with these vectors. Understand and proactively act on the risks, friction points, differences that make the difference, and success proposition criteria of both our existing customers as well as our marketplace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend at least X hours per week in Thinking Time sessions with a high- quality question. While some of these questions will be tactical, the majority should be strategic and be based on bottlenecks, gaps in performance, leverage, underutilized assets, priorities, direction, and asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be successful and comfortable in a small business.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be comfortable acting on the old motto “No challenge is too large and yet no task is too small.” Be comfortable working in a small, tight-knit family of people all carrying multiple, simultaneous responsibilities. Demonstrate your understanding of the fact that you need these people far more than they need you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make us better by learning lessons.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make the company better with each event. We have the ability to learn from each success and failure. When an A player joins us, let’s learn why, and when an A player leaves, let’s learn why they made this decision. When a strategy works, let’s learn why; and when strategies fail, let’s figure out what went wrong and how we can avoid this mistake in the future. Create and oversee a company improvement initiative with expected results and actions as well as periodic follow-ups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leave your ego out.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your success will not be based on being right, righteous, or smart. Your success is measured by producing results, regardless of the source of the idea that produced them. Be humble and give the team the credit. After all, you are merely pointing the flashlight; they are doing all the digging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be intelligent.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn fast and demonstrate the ability to quickly and proficiently understand and absorb new information. Be able to structure and process qualitative or quantitative data and draw insightful conclusions from it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on your outcomes and results-produce.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly understand the outcomes and standards expected of you and your position. Commit to your outcomes, establish clear work plans (MBOs) to achieve each outcome, and measure yourself as well as your team. Know at all times if you are meeting your commitments, attaining your outcomes, and producing the value expected of you. Get and stay organized. Get and stay focused on your outcomes. Prioritize and operate with a major objective as the goal line. Be proactive and pay attention to detail. Avoid interesting activities (shiny pennies) that distract you from your outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be flexible and adaptable.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>___ is a small business that is growing fast and expanding into new markets. Outcomes, standards, responsibilities, approaches, methodologies, and strategies will change from time to time-sometimes with your consent and approval; sometimes without. Be able to adjust quickly to changing priorities and conditions and be able to cope effectively with complexity and change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Always invest in learning, growing, and improving yourself.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Never be good enough. Never be smart enough. Never know all there is to know about leading, attracting new business, servicing our customers, or building the team. Demonstrate a continuous desire to learn by reading books (I read two to three per week), watching videos, attending seminars, and going to formal training. Be willing to spend your own money and your personal time in addition to the company’s. Demonstrate that you are participating in your own development, your own success, and your own growth. Visibly bring back what you learn to the company and teach others. Help others grow with you.</li>

<p>“Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.”</p>
<p>Operators react and sweat. Owners think and plan</p>
<p>“I insist on a lot of time being spent thinking, almost every day, to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. I read and think. So I do more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most people in business. I do it because I like this kind of life.” —Warren Buffett</p>
<p>The key to defining the root problem is discovering the obstacle (it resides in the gap) that is impeding your progress from here to there. It is the obstacle that is the problem, not the dissatisfaction with your current circumstances!</p>
<p>“Mistakes are not a sin unless it is not admitted. Until you admitted and take responsibility, it will be hard to learn the lesson and move forward. More importantly, you might not be able to foresee when that mistake wants to happen and you will definitely fall into the same trap and make a worse mistake.</p>
<p>You are right not because others agree with you, but because your facts and reasoning are sound.” – Benjamin Graham</p>
<p>“Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.“</p>
<p>“Success is not an accident. Sustainable business success requires leverage, and one of the most critical forms of leverage available to a business Owner is the leverage of structure.”</p>
<p>“When the environment radically changes and you are confronted with moments of uncertainty and danger, clinging to the old “right” way might seem like a good idea, but it can frequently be deadly.”</p>

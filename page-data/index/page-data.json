These five practices include automating the build for continuously integrating software as it is written, collaborating with team members through pair programming, practicing agile design skills that enable testability, using test-first development to drive design, and refactoring code to reduce technical debt.</p>\n<p>Together, these five practices are proving to be essential for sustained success with Scrum development. But many Scrum teams have not been exposed to the benefits of these practices or how to use them effectively. In this session, we explore these engineering practices and how to use them to reduce risk and build quality in at every level of the development process.</p>\n<p>Bio:\nDavid Bernstein’s continuing passion for software design and construction has led him to train more than 10,000 developers since 1990 for clients that have included Microsoft, IBM, Yahoo, Boeing, AT&#x26;T, Sprint, Medtronic, SunGard, State Farm, MetLife, and Weyerhaeuser. As a longtime IBM consultant, David has trained software engineers around the globe, giving them the skills to write the next generation of applications and operating system software. Since 2006, David has devoted his consulting practice to providing organizations with training and coaching for software developers and teams transitioning to Agile and Scrum.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the book, Beyond Legacy Code: Nine Practices to Extend the Life (and Value) of Your Software, visit <a href=\"http://BeyondLegacyCode.com\">http://BeyondLegacyCode.com</a>.

He has generously provided a 20% discount, if you use the code “Crafter” at checkout.</p>\n<p>Become a Certified Scrum Developer online and master XP practices.\nThis immersive, thirty-six-hour Scrum Developer Certification training program contains a set of two comprehensive component courses that provide the knowledge and skills to become a successful Scrum developer and a valuable member of a Scrum development team. In the Certified Scrum Developer course, you will explore the Scrum Framework and how to use it to support faster and simpler software development as well as discover core design principles and patterns to guide you in building more maintainable code. In the Advanced-Certified Scrum Developer course, you’ll learn how to write higher quality code more quickly and with fewer defects using practices from Extreme Programming (XP) that include test-first development, refactoring, and emergent design, as well as a variety of Agile problem-solving techniques. The next class begins October 5 and is divided into 4-hour digestible online sessions. Crafters get an additional 20% off when you register for both classes and use discount code Crafter at <a href=\"https://sdc20211005.eventbee.com\">https://sdc20211005.eventbee.com</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"David Bernstein - Five Developer Practices for Agile Software","path":"/david-bernstein-5-developer-practices/","category":"AgileTechnicalPractices","tags":["TDD","Refactor","CI","AgileTechnicalPractices"],"description":"Five Developer Practices for Agile Software with David Bernstein","date":"2021/09/07","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/b94527745e12757e369c342dd2615d58/02c2d/david-bernstein.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b94527745e12757e369c342dd2615d58/1ada3/david-bernstein.jpg 125w,\n/static/b94527745e12757e369c342dd2615d58/8f7df/david-bernstein.jpg 250w,\n/static/b94527745e12757e369c342dd2615d58/02c2d/david-bernstein.jpg 429w","sizes":"(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px"}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Emergent design is a cornerstone of eXtreme programming, TDD and Refactoring.

Back in the States, while studying drafting in high school, he started fire eating, sleight of hand magic, and once rode a unicycle 6 miles. After learning to juggle torches, he joined an acrobatics group in college where he specialized on the trampoline and walking a slack rope.\nLater, he learned to play the doumbek (a type of drum), to accompany a belly dancing girlfriend.</p>\n<p>He can calculate the cube root of any perfect cube under 1,000,000 in his head, as well as pick a standard lock. He can rollerblade down a flight of stairs, backwards. Llewellyn studied Tai Chi for 2 years, can throw a knife at 20 feet, and a playing card at 50. He has taught swing dancing, and loves to salsa. He is also an accomplished speed chess player. He has been scuba diving over 20 times, became a guitarhero, and broken his personal paddle balling record over 200 times.</p>\n<p>Llewellyn attributes his success to the large amount of caffeine he has consumed, and enjoys computer programming in his spare time.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Duplication Coloring Book with Llewellyn Falco","path":"/llewellyn-duplication-coloring-book/","category":"AgileTechnicalPractices","tags":["Refactor","AgileTechnicalPractices"],"description":"Duplication Coloring Book with Llewellyn Falco","date":"2021/05/11","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/011f804321a652f2ede911a52f27792a/0f3a1/llewellyn-falco.jpg","srcSet":"/static/011f804321a652f2ede911a52f27792a/1ada3/llewellyn-falco.jpg 125w,\n/static/011f804321a652f2ede911a52f27792a/8f7df/llewellyn-falco.jpg 250w,\n/static/011f804321a652f2ede911a52f27792a/0f3a1/llewellyn-falco.jpg 500w,\n/static/011f804321a652f2ede911a52f27792a/4fe8c/llewellyn-falco.jpg 600w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Everyone is talking about event-driven architectures and streaming data.

There are many types of thinking which include: big-picture thinking, focus thinking, creative thinking, realistic thinking, strategic thinking, possibility thinking, reflecting thinking, questioning popular thinking, shared thinking, unselfish thinking and bottom-line thinking. You don’t need to be a master at all the thinking types but simply find people who can compensate for the weak areas. <strong>every day, set aside a certain time to think, find a thinking place and have a system/process that works for you.

A great craftsman wants you to inspect his work, to look closely at its finest details. In contrast, sloppy people hide their work.

That kind of commitment will take you where halfhearted people will never go.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In general, people approach daily commitment in one of two ways. They focus on the external or the internal. Those who focus on the external expect conditions to determine whether they keep their commitments. Because conditions are so transitory, their commitment level changes like the wind. In contrast, people who base their actions on the internal usually focus on their choices. Each choice is a crossroad that will either confirm or compromise their commitments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expect that commitment will be a struggle, but it is worth it. Focus on your choices and stick with them. This requires hard work and dedication. It helps you go when life gets rough, and the pain becomes great.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>don’t rely on talent alone.

Methods always change, Values never do.”</p>\n<p>“Today, 2.5 percent of our income goes to charitable giving. That’s lower than it was during the Great Depression (2.9 percent). And 80 percent of Americans who earn at least $1 million a year leave nothing to charity in their wills.”</p>\n<p>“Greatness is not defined by what a person receives, but by what that person gives.”</p>\n<p>“You are not here merely to make a living.

The reality is that this type of action is programming our subconscious mind with the instructions that it is okay for us to not follow through with the things we intended to do”.</p>\n<p>“Always remember that who you’re becoming is far more important than what you’re doing, and yet it is what you’re doing that is determining who you’re becoming”.</p>\n<p>“Virtually all highly successful people—from CEOs to professional athletes to the President of the United States—embrace a high degree of accountability”.</p>\n<p>“Accountability is the act of being responsible to someone else for some action or result”.</p>\n<p>“Here’s the problem: accountability was never something you and I asked for, but rather something that we endured as children, teens, and young adults. As it was forced upon us by adults, most of us unconsciously grew to resist and resent accountability altogether”.</p>\n<p>“Our levels of success will rarely exceed our level of personal development, because success is something we attract by who we become”.</p>\n<p>“Remember this truth: now matters more than any other time in your life, because it’s what you are doing today that is determining who you’re becoming, and who you’re becoming will always determine the quality and direction of your life”.</p>\n<p>“Every time you hit the snooze button, you’re in a state of resistance to your day, to your life, and to waking up and creating the life you say you want”.</p>\n<p>“It’s been said that nobody actually likes waking up early, but everyone loves the feeling of having woken up early.The first key to waking up is to remember [to set your intentions before bed]: Your first thought in the morning is usually the last thought you had before you went to bed”.</p>\n<p>“If you keep your alarm clock next to your bed, then you are still in a partial sleep-state when the alarm goes off, and it makes it much more difficult to wake yourself up”.</p>\n<p>“It’s crucial that you hydrate yourself first thing every morning. After 6-8 hours without water, you’ll naturally be mildly dehydrated, and dehydration causes fatigue”.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dansilvestre.com/miracle-morning/\">https://dansilvestre.com/miracle-morning/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.getstoryshots.com/books/the-miracle-morning-summary/\">https://www.getstoryshots.com/books/the-miracle-morning-summary/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"miracle morning by El Harod summary","date":"July 25, 2022","description":"miracle morning by El Harod summary"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-talk-to-anyone-summary/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"how to talk to anyone by Leil Lowndes summary"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/mindset-new-psychology-success/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"mindset new psychology of success by Carol summary"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5fa216cc-0b65-57da-8b03-e5d0326e6130","previousPostId":"4037f140-48df-59fd-87bd-0d2a9fa60236","nextPostId":"df1046fe-8798-59d2-bc15-d3f741d8a5d5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}

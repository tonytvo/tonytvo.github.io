Give the modules the names that become part of the ubiquitous language. Modules are part of the model, and their names should reflect insight into the domain.</li>\n<li>Seek low coupling in the sense of concepts that can be understood and reasoned about independently.

Highlighting any sharing, isolation mechanism, and levels of influence.</li>\n<li>Map the existing terrain. Take up the transformations later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>partnership</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>when teams in two contexts succeed or fail together, a cooperative relationship often emerges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>where development failure in either of two contexts would result in delivery failure for both, forging a partnership between the teams in charge of the two contexts. Institute a process for coordinated planning of development and joint management of integration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The teams must cooperate on the evolution of their interface to accommodate the developments needs of both systems.</li>\n<li>Interdependent features should be scheduled to complete for the same release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>shared kernel</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>sharing a part of the model and associated code is a very intimate interdependency, which can leverage design work or undermine it.</li>\n<li>Design with an explicit boundary some subset of the domain model that the teams agree to share. Keep this kernel small.</li>\n<li>Within this boundary, include this subset of the model, the subset of code or the database design associated with that part of the model.</li>\n<li>This explicitly shared stuff has a special status and shouldn’t be changed without consultation with the other team.</li>\n<li>When functional integration is limited, the overhead of continuous integration of a significant context may be deemed too high. This may especially be true when the team does not have the skill or the political organization to maintain continuous integration or when a single team is simply too big and unwieldy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>customer/supplier development</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>when 2 teams are in an upstream-downstream relationship, where the upstream team may succeed independently of the fate of the downstream team, the needs of the downstream come to be addressed in a variety of ways with a wide range of consequences.</li>\n<li>Establish a clear customer/supplier relationship between the two teams, meaning downstream priorities factor into upstream planning.</li>\n<li>Negotiate and budget tasks for downstream requirements so that everyone understands the commitment and schedule</li>\n<li>jointly developed automated acceptance tests and validate the expected interface from the upstream. Adding these tests to the upstream team’s test suite, to be run as part of its continuous integration, will free the upstream team to make changes without fear of downstream side effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>conformist</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>similar to customer/supplier, but the upstream has no motivation to provide for the downstream team’s need</li>\n<li>to eliminate the complexity of translation between bounded contexts by slavishly adhering to the model of the upstream team.</li>\n<li>Ubiquitous language with your upstream team will be shared.</li>\n<li>Altruism may be sufficient to get them to share information with you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>anticorruption layer</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Translation becomes more complex when control or communication is insufficient to pull off a shared kernel, partner, or customer/supplier relationship. As a result, the translation takes on a more defensive tone.</li>\n<li>As a downstream client, create an isolating layer to provide your system with the functionality of the upstream system in terms of your own domain model.</li>\n<li>This layer talks to the other system through its existing interface, requiring little or no modification to the other system. Internally, the layer translates in one or both directions as necessary between the two models.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>open-host service</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Where integration is one-off, this approach of inserting a translation layer for each external system avoids corruption of the models with a minimum cost.</li>\n<li>Define a protocol that gives access to your subsystem as a set of services. Then, open the protocol so that all who need to integrate with you can use it.</li>\n<li>Enhance and expand the protocol to handle new integration requirements, except when a single team has idiosyncratic needs. Then, use a one-off translator to augment the protocol for that particular case so what the shared protocol can stay coherent and straightforward.</li>\n<li>When a subsystem has to be integrated with many others, customizing a translator for each can bog down the team. There is more and more to maintain and more and more to worry about when changes are made.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Published language</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The translation between the models of two bounded contexts requires a common language.</li>\n<li>Use a well-documented shared language to express the necessary domain information as a common communication medium, translating as essential into and out of that language.</li>\n<li>Published language is often combined with open-host service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>separate ways</h2>\n<p>declare a bounded context to have no connection to the others, allowing developers to find simple, specialized solutions within this small scope.</p>\n<h2>big ball of mud</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>well-defined context boundaries only emerge from intellectual choices and social forces (even though the people creating the systems may not always have been consciously aware of these causes at the time).</li>\n<li>Draw a boundary around the entire mess and designate it as a big ball of mud. Do not try to apply sophisticated modelling within this context.</li>\n<li>Be alert to the tendency for such systems to sprawl into other contexts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Distillation for strategic design</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>how do you focus on your central problem and keep from drowning in a sea of side issues?</li>\n<li>Distillation is the process of separating the components of a mixture to extract the essence in a form that makes it more valuable and useful</li>\n<li>A model is a distillation of knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>core domain</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>to make a domain model an asset, the critical core of that model has to be sleek and fully leveraged to create application functionality.</li>\n<li>Boil the model down. Define a core domain and provide a means of easily distinguishing it from the mass of supporting model and code.</li>\n<li><strong>Bring the most valuable and specialized concepts into sharp relief. Make the core small.</strong></li>\n<li>Apply top talent to the core domain, and recruit accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend the effort in the core to find a deep model and develop a supple design - sufficient to fulfill the system’s vision.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>generic subdomains</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>some parts of the model add complexity without capturing or communicating specialized knowledge.</li>\n<li>Identify cohesive subdomains that are not the motivation for your project, factor out generic models of these subdomains and place them in separate modules.</li>\n<li>Leave no trace of your specialties in them.</li>\n<li>once they have been separated, give their continuing development lower priority than the core domain, and avoid assigning your core developers to the tasks (because they will gain little domain knowledge from them)</li>\n<li>also, consider off-the-shelf solutions or published models for these generic subdomains.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>domain vision statement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>the critical aspects of the domain model may span multiple bounded contexts, but by definition, these distinct models can’t be structured to show their common focus.</li>\n<li>Write a short description (about one page) of the core domain and the value it will bring, the “value proposition.” ignore those aspects that do not distinguish this domain model from others.</li>\n<li>Write this statement early and revise it as you gain new insight.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>highlighted core</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>a domain vision statement identifies the core domain in broad terms, but it leaves the identification of the specific core model elements up to the vagaries of individual interpretation. Unless there is an exceptionally high level of communication on the team, the vision statement alone will have little impact.</li>\n<li><strong>The mental labour of constantly filtering the model to identify the essential parts absorbs concentration better spent on design thinking, and it requires comprehensive knowledge of the model. Therefore, the core domain must be made easier to see.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Write a brief document (3-7 sparse pages) describing the core domain and the primary interactions among core elements.</strong></li>\n<li>Flag the elements of the core domain within the primary repository of the model without particularly trying to elucidate its role. Make it effortless for a developer to know what is in or out of the core.</li>\n<li>Although the vision statement and highlighted core inform and guide, they do not modify the model or the code itself.</li>\n<li>Partitioning generic subdomains physically removes some distracting elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>cohesive mechanisms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>structurally change the model and the design to make the core domain more visible and manageable.</li>\n<li><strong>The conceptual “what” is swamped by the mechanistic “how.” Many methods that provide algorithms for resolving the problem obscure the methods that express the problem.</strong></li>\n<li>Partition a conceptually cohesive mechanism into a separate lightweight framework. Particularly watch for formalisms or well-documented categories of algorithms.</li>\n<li><strong>Expose the capabilities of the framework with an intention-revealing interface.</strong></li>\n<li>The other elements of the domain can focus on expressing the problem (“what”), delegating the intricacies of the solution (“how”) to the framework.</li>\n<li><strong>Factoring out generic subdomains reduces clutter, and cohesive mechanisms serve to encapsulate complex operations. This leaves behind a more focused model, with fewer distractions that add no particular value to how users conduct their activities.</strong></li>\n<li>You are unlikely to find good homes for everything in the domain model that is not core.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The segregated core</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>approach to structurally marking off the core domain.</li>\n<li>Refactor the model to separate the core concepts from supporting players (including ill-defined ones) and strengthen the cohesion of the core while reducing its coupling to other code.</li>\n<li>Factor all generic or supporting elements into other objects and place them into different packages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>abstract core</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The core domain model usually has so much detail that communicates the big picture.</li>\n<li>Identify the most fundamental differentiating concepts in the model and factor them into distinct classes, abstract classes, or interfaces.</li>\n<li>Design this abstract model to express most of the interaction between significant components.</li>\n<li>Place this abstract model in its own module, while the specialized, detailed implementation classes are left in their own modules defined by the subdomain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>large scale structure for strategic design</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A “large-scale structure” is a language that lets you discuss and understand the system in broad strokes. A set of high-level concepts or rules, or both, establishes a pattern of design for an entire system.</li>\n<li><strong>Devise a pattern of rules or roles and relationships that will span the entire system and allow some understanding of each part’s place in the whole-even without detailed knowledge of the part’s responsibility.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>evolving order</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Architectures can straitjacket a project with up-front design assumptions and take too much power away from the developers/designers of particular application parts. Soon, developers/designers of specific details of the applications will dumb down the application to fit the structure, or they will subvert it and have no structure, bringing back the problems of uncoordinated development.</li>\n<li>Let this large-scale conceptual structure evolve with the application, possibly changing to a completely different type of structure along the way. Don’t constraint the detailed design and model decisions that must be made with thorough knowledge.</li>\n<li>The large-scale structure should be applied when a structure can be found that dramatically clarifies the system without forcing unnatural constraints on model development. Because an ill-fitting structure is worse than none, it is best not to shoot for comprehensiveness but rather to find a minimal set that solves the emerging problem. Less is more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>system metaphor</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>software designs tend to be abstract and hard to grasp. Developers and users alike need tangible ways to understand the system and share a view of the system as a whole.</li>\n<li>When a concrete analogy to the system emerges that captures the imagination of team members and seems to lead thinking in a helpful direction, adopt it as a large-scale structure.</li>\n<li>Organize the design around this metaphor and absorb it into the ubiquitous language.</li>\n<li>The system metaphor should facilitate communication about the system and guide the development. This increases consistency in different system parts, potentially even across different bounded contexts.</li>\n<li>Because all metaphors are inexact, continually reexamine the metaphor for overextension or inaptness, and be ready to drop it if it gets in the way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>responsibility layers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>look at the conceptual dependencies in your model and the varying rates and sources of change of different parts of your domain.</li>\n<li>If you identify natural strata in the domain, cast them as broad abstract responsibilities.</li>\n<li><strong>These responsibilities should tell a story of your system’s high-level purpose and design.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Refactor the model so that the responsibilities of each domain object, aggregate, and module fit neatly within the responsibility of one layer.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>knowledge level</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>a group of objects that describe how another group of objects should behave.</li>\n<li>Create a distinct set of objects that can define and constrain the structure and behaviour of the basic model.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep these concerns separate as 2 “levels,” one very concrete, the other reflecting rules and knowledge that a user or super-user can customize.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pluggable component framework</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>a pluggable component framework usually only comes into play after a few applications have already been implemented in the same domain.</li>\n<li>Distill an abstract core of interfaces and interactions and create a framework that allows diverse implementations of those interfaces to be freely substituted. Likewise, it will enable any application to use those components, so long as it operates strictly through the interfaces of the abstract core.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Getting DDD started with Legacy Systems</h1>\n<h2>strategy 1: bubble context</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>the legacy system already has an established model, albeit implicit, which can seldom be changed with a reasonable effort.</li>\n<li>Simply adding objects that express a distinct model without changing the ones already there will lead to conflicting rules and concepts.</li>\n<li>Introducing a complex new set of development principles and techniques is best done incrementally as in a pilot project, in a way that allows members of the team to gain experience and allows the organization to assess the approach.</li>\n<li><strong>This pilot project allows a small team to achieve a modest objective involving some complex domain logic and, ideally, one with some strategic value that is difficult to solve in a legacy context. Therefore, it is recommended to cherry-pick a small, self-disciplined team with control over its code to evolve a model that addresses the chosen area, relatively unconstrained by the concepts of the legacy systems.</strong></li>\n<li>The new functionality does not disappear. It will continue to be maintained as an extension of the legacy systems. The organization now has the experience to undertake more ambitious use of DDD.</li>\n<li>no synchronization risk (uses a legacy database)</li>\n<li><strong>works when there is a limited range of data needed from legacy</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A ‘bubble’ is a small bounded context established using an Anticorruption Layer (ACL) for the purpose of a particular development effort and not intended necessarily to be expanded or used for a long time.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 358px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8d362aceaf91448df6fa280da41a0808/39185/acl-backed-repository-implementation.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 112.0253164556962%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"ACL-Backed Repository Implementation\"\n        title=\"ACL-Backed Repository Implementation\"\n        src=\"/static/8d362aceaf91448df6fa280da41a0808/39185/acl-backed-repository-implementation.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8d362aceaf91448df6fa280da41a0808/c26ae/acl-backed-repository-implementation.png 158w,\n/static/8d362aceaf91448df6fa280da41a0808/6bdcf/acl-backed-repository-implementation.png 315w,\n/static/8d362aceaf91448df6fa280da41a0808/39185/acl-backed-repository-implementation.png 358w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ACL should be explicitly addressed in budgeting and planning.

Then it must be mapped into the bubble context, increasing the dependency between the two systems. Clearly, this is not the strategy to introduce crucial new information.</li>\n<li>Development in the autonomous bubble is not so tightly bound to the older contexts. Therefore, the model in this context can be more innovative and trow more freely, and a fresh new product can be created.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strategy 3: exposing legacy assets as services</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>one of the main challenges of SOA is the lack of attention to bounded contexts.</li>\n<li>Integrating with the legacy system, every new development effort gets dragged back into the old concepts and potentially tangled into the old implementation.</li>\n<li>Legacy assets were developed with a particular feature set in mind and are highly coupled to those features. This makes it hard to access what you want directly without going through layers designed for a very different purpose.</li>\n<li>open host service over anticorruption layer</li>\n<li>Commons Context, the most basic and widely used information, can be interchanged throughout the organization via one standard interchange model, the “Tragedy of the Commons.” But, unfortunately, the commons are prone to dumping.</li>\n<li>FIX has a way of describing an enormous range of financial trades and transactions and is used to interchange data between all sorts of organizations.</li>\n<li>a focused language, crafted for a modest suite of related services, usually gives the most satisfying balance between the fragmentation of the one-off service model and the total unification of the commons and the industry-standard</li>\n<li>we should get over the attitude that the ultimate goal is to eventually replace these older systems. That is a futile treadmill. Creating a bubble can allow you to selectively move responsibilities for the core domain, where you want to innovate, out into a new context.</li>\n<li>Open host services over an ACL can give convenient, decoupled access to functionality and data assets embedded in the older systems. Once the legacy system is stable, not responsible for the core domain, and provides access to assets, why not let it be? You have better things to do right now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>strategy 4: expanding a bubble</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>one challenge that is particularly acute in a bubble is how critical it is to coordinate the incremental development of the new business functionality and the anticorruption layer in parallel. This affects the design and the planning of the sequence in which the features are written.</li>\n<li>design freedom is the point of a bubble, the bubble context with an umbilical ACL gives a little freedom, while the autonomous bubble can give a lot if properly managed.</li>\n<li>things to think about for ACL\n<ul>\n<li>does the new feature draw on information that is already being brought in by the existing anti-corruption layer</li>\n<li>will it require new mapping of legacy information? what is the scope of that work?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>if multiple features were chosen for the iteration call for new mapping, are they drawing on the same information, or does each call for different information?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>to make development manageable, the priority of business features must be balanced with the need to group work on features that use similar legacy data sets, with parallel planning of the necessary enhancements to the anticorruption layer.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if not careful, the bulk of the project’s effort will go into implementing a big translator interface, each element of which is only sparsely used. This gives a low ROI for the context boundary, and eventually an unsustainable maintenance burden. Or developers would take shortcuts by making sloppy mappings or simply bypassing the ACL, pull the data they need directly from the legacy system, and the context boundary will erode and collapse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the developers working on various features all drawing that same data can collaborate to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>model the new information by adding concepts to the bubble context</li>\n<li>extend the ACL to bring in the new information. (This should be an explicit development task, not just part of a ‘user story’)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Trying to reuse the fields/data from legacy without a mapping is a mistake. The concept represented by those fields was never mapped to a concept in the downstream context. We have no idea what they mean in the downstream context or how they relate to other concepts in the downstream model. It creates bigger objects with more dependencies and that is poorly defined.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when you must make choice, try to make the bubble’s model capable of expressing the essential meaning of the new information in terms consistent with the other concepts of that model. It is inadvisable to load objects down with information that does not directly pertain to their jobs, so it is best to do a bit more modelling work to find good homes for the new information.</li>\n<li>bypass the context altogether, give the client access to the context where the information originated or pass it some other way (particularly when the new data is for display only) Sometimes this is a good time to expose a legacy asset with a service as in Strategy 3.</li>\n<li>pass the information unchanged through new context. (Not recommended) since you have bored a tunnel through your anticorruption layer and compromised your ability to evolve your new model independently of the legacy system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>adding data is a modelling job</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is a way of referring to some aspect of some business situation, and the goal when translating this new element into your bubble context is to enrich the ubiquitous language to be able to express these concerns.</li>\n<li>explore new scenarios in the DDD modelling whirlpool</li>\n<li>in order to pull in more data to use in logic or key definitions in your context, you should follow the whirlpool steps\n<ul>\n<li>hammer out a reference scenario that illustrates why you need a new information</li>\n<li>brainstorm model changes that incorporate that information organically</li>\n<li>context boundary leakage gets out of hand quickly and suddenly you may wake up to realize that your new software is conforming to the legacy model and does not give the desired fresh start for the business.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“Sub-domain is a problem space concept, Bounded context is a solution space concept.”</p>\n<p>“As software developers, we fail in two ways: We build the thing wrong, or we build the wrong thing.”</p>\n<p>“A project faces serious problems when its language is fractured.”</p>\n<p>“Integration is always expensive, and sometimes the benefit is small.”</p>\n<p>“Architectures can straitjacket a project with up-front design assumptions and take too much power away from the developers/designers of particular parts of the application. Soon, developers/designers of particular parts of the applications will dumb down the application to fit the structure, or they will subvert it and have no structure at all, bringing back the problems of uncoordinated development..”</p>\n<p>“Each time we decide to call upon such a capability for some new purpose, someone has to meticulously sift through it all, finding an odd combination of inputs that will evoke the behaviour or return the information we want without messing anything else up, it takes trial and error and extensive testing, and the result is typically brittle. The developer who made it work walks away exhausted, successful on his terms, leaving the system even more complex than before.

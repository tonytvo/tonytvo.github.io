State these assertions in the ubiquitous language of a specific bounded context.</li>\n<li>Give the service a name, which also becomes a ubiquitous language.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>modules</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>concepts should be divided into modules.</li>\n<li>Choose modules that tell the story of the system and contain a cohesive set of ideas. Give the modules the names that become part of the ubiquitous language. Modules are part of the model, and their names should reflect insight into the domain.</li>\n<li>Seek low coupling in the sense of concepts that can be understood and reasoned about independently. Then, refine the model until it partitions according to high-level domain concepts and decouples the corresponding code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>aggregates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>it challenging to guarantee the consistency of changes to objects in a model with complex associations.</strong></li>\n<li>Cluster the entities and value objects into aggregates and define boundaries around each.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose one entity to be the root of each sum, and allow external objects to hold references to the source only (regarding internal members passed out for use within a single operation only.</strong></li>\n<li>define properties and invariants for the aggregate as a whole and give enforcement responsibility to the root or some designated framework mechanism</li>\n<li>Use the exact aggregate boundaries to govern transactions and distribution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>within an aggregate edge, apply consistency rules synchronously.

Keep application logic focused on the model, delegating all object storage and access to the repositories.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>factories</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>shift the responsibility for creating instances of complex objects and aggregates to a separate object, which may itself have no responsibility in the domain model but is still part of the domain design.</li>\n<li>Provide an interface that encapsulates all complex assemblies and does not require the client to reference the concrete classes of the instantiated objects.</li>\n<li><strong>Create an entire aggregate as a piece, enforcing its invariants.</strong></li>\n<li>Create complex value objects like a piece, possibly after assembling the elements with a builder.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Supple design</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Supple design complements the deep modelling</li>\n<li>client developer, who weaves the domain objects into the application code or other domain layer code.</li>\n<li><strong>The client developer can flexibly use a minimal set of loosely coupled concepts to express a range of scenarios in the domain.</strong></li>\n<li>The effects of its code must be transparently obvious, so the consequences of a change will be easy to anticipate.</li>\n<li><strong>Making behaviour obvious</strong></li>\n<li><strong>reduces the cost of change</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>intention-revealing interfaces</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>name classes and operations to describe their effect and purpose, without reference to how they do what they promise.</strong></li>\n<li>This relieves the client developer of the need to understand the internals.</li>\n<li><strong>These names should conform to the ubiquitous language so that team members can quickly infer their meaning.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Before creating it, write a test for behaviour to force your thinking into client developer mode.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>assertions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>state post-conditions of operations and invariants of classes and aggregates with assertions</li>\n<li><strong>if assertions cannot be coded directly in your programming language, write automated unit tests for them.</strong></li>\n<li>Write them into documentation or diagrams to fit the project’s development process style.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>closure of operations (not very clear to me yet)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>where it fits, define a function whose return type is the same as its arguments</li>\n<li>if the implementer has a state used in the computation.

This includes the implicit models of non-object-oriented subsystems.</li>\n<li>Name each bounded context, and make the names part of the ubiquitous language</li>\n<li>describe the point of contact between the models, outlining explicit translation for any communication. Highlighting any sharing, isolation mechanism, and levels of influence.</li>\n<li>Map the existing terrain. Take up the transformations later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>partnership</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>when teams in two contexts succeed or fail together, a cooperative relationship often emerges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>where development failure in either of two contexts would result in delivery failure for both, forging a partnership between the teams in charge of the two contexts. Institute a process for coordinated planning of development and joint management of integration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The teams must cooperate on the evolution of their interface to accommodate the developments needs of both systems.</li>\n<li>Interdependent features should be scheduled to complete for the same release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>shared kernel</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>sharing a part of the model and associated code is a very intimate interdependency, which can leverage design work or undermine it.</li>\n<li>Design with an explicit boundary some subset of the domain model that the teams agree to share. Keep this kernel small.</li>\n<li>Within this boundary, include this subset of the model, the subset of code or the database design associated with that part of the model.</li>\n<li>This explicitly shared stuff has a special status and shouldn’t be changed without consultation with the other team.</li>\n<li>When functional integration is limited, the overhead of continuous integration of a significant context may be deemed too high. This may especially be true when the team does not have the skill or the political organization to maintain continuous integration or when a single team is simply too big and unwieldy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>customer/supplier development</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>when 2 teams are in an upstream-downstream relationship, where the upstream team may succeed independently of the fate of the downstream team, the needs of the downstream come to be addressed in a variety of ways with a wide range of consequences.</li>\n<li>Establish a clear customer/supplier relationship between the two teams, meaning downstream priorities factor into upstream planning.</li>\n<li>Negotiate and budget tasks for downstream requirements so that everyone understands the commitment and schedule</li>\n<li>jointly developed automated acceptance tests and validate the expected interface from the upstream. Adding these tests to the upstream team’s test suite, to be run as part of its continuous integration, will free the upstream team to make changes without fear of downstream side effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>conformist</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>similar to customer/supplier, but the upstream has no motivation to provide for the downstream team’s need</li>\n<li>to eliminate the complexity of translation between bounded contexts by slavishly adhering to the model of the upstream team.</li>\n<li>Ubiquitous language with your upstream team will be shared.</li>\n<li>Altruism may be sufficient to get them to share information with you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>anticorruption layer</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Translation becomes more complex when control or communication is insufficient to pull off a shared kernel, partner, or customer/supplier relationship. As a result, the translation takes on a more defensive tone.</li>\n<li>As a downstream client, create an isolating layer to provide your system with the functionality of the upstream system in terms of your own domain model.</li>\n<li>This layer talks to the other system through its existing interface, requiring little or no modification to the other system. Internally, the layer translates in one or both directions as necessary between the two models.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>open-host service</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Where integration is one-off, this approach of inserting a translation layer for each external system avoids corruption of the models with a minimum cost.</li>\n<li>Define a protocol that gives access to your subsystem as a set of services. Then, open the protocol so that all who need to integrate with you can use it.</li>\n<li>Enhance and expand the protocol to handle new integration requirements, except when a single team has idiosyncratic needs. Then, use a one-off translator to augment the protocol for that particular case so what the shared protocol can stay coherent and straightforward.</li>\n<li>When a subsystem has to be integrated with many others, customizing a translator for each can bog down the team. There is more and more to maintain and more and more to worry about when changes are made.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Published language</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The translation between the models of two bounded contexts requires a common language.</li>\n<li>Use a well-documented shared language to express the necessary domain information as a common communication medium, translating as essential into and out of that language.</li>\n<li>Published language is often combined with open-host service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>separate ways</h2>\n<p>declare a bounded context to have no connection to the others, allowing developers to find simple, specialized solutions within this small scope.</p>\n<h2>big ball of mud</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>well-defined context boundaries only emerge from intellectual choices and social forces (even though the people creating the systems may not always have been consciously aware of these causes at the time).</li>\n<li>Draw a boundary around the entire mess and designate it as a big ball of mud. Do not try to apply sophisticated modelling within this context.</li>\n<li>Be alert to the tendency for such systems to sprawl into other contexts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Distillation for strategic design</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>how do you focus on your central problem and keep from drowning in a sea of side issues?</li>\n<li>Distillation is the process of separating the components of a mixture to extract the essence in a form that makes it more valuable and useful</li>\n<li>A model is a distillation of knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>core domain</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>to make a domain model an asset, the critical core of that model has to be sleek and fully leveraged to create application functionality.</li>\n<li>Boil the model down. Define a core domain and provide a means of easily distinguishing it from the mass of supporting model and code.</li>\n<li><strong>Bring the most valuable and specialized concepts into sharp relief. Make the core small.</strong></li>\n<li>Apply top talent to the core domain, and recruit accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend the effort in the core to find a deep model and develop a supple design - sufficient to fulfill the system’s vision.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>generic subdomains</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>some parts of the model add complexity without capturing or communicating specialized knowledge.</li>\n<li>Identify cohesive subdomains that are not the motivation for your project, factor out generic models of these subdomains and place them in separate modules.</li>\n<li>Leave no trace of your specialties in them.</li>\n<li>once they have been separated, give their continuing development lower priority than the core domain, and avoid assigning your core developers to the tasks (because they will gain little domain knowledge from them)</li>\n<li>also, consider off-the-shelf solutions or published models for these generic subdomains.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>domain vision statement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>the critical aspects of the domain model may span multiple bounded contexts, but by definition, these distinct models can’t be structured to show their common focus.</li>\n<li>Write a short description (about one page) of the core domain and the value it will bring, the “value proposition.” ignore those aspects that do not distinguish this domain model from others.</li>\n<li>Write this statement early and revise it as you gain new insight.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>highlighted core</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>a domain vision statement identifies the core domain in broad terms, but it leaves the identification of the specific core model elements up to the vagaries of individual interpretation. Unless there is an exceptionally high level of communication on the team, the vision statement alone will have little impact.</li>\n<li><strong>The mental labour of constantly filtering the model to identify the essential parts absorbs concentration better spent on design thinking, and it requires comprehensive knowledge of the model. Therefore, the core domain must be made easier to see.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Write a brief document (3-7 sparse pages) describing the core domain and the primary interactions among core elements.</strong></li>\n<li>Flag the elements of the core domain within the primary repository of the model without particularly trying to elucidate its role. Make it effortless for a developer to know what is in or out of the core.</li>\n<li>Although the vision statement and highlighted core inform and guide, they do not modify the model or the code itself.</li>\n<li>Partitioning generic subdomains physically removes some distracting elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>cohesive mechanisms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>structurally change the model and the design to make the core domain more visible and manageable.</li>\n<li><strong>The conceptual “what” is swamped by the mechanistic “how.” Many methods that provide algorithms for resolving the problem obscure the methods that express the problem.</strong></li>\n<li>Partition a conceptually cohesive mechanism into a separate lightweight framework. Particularly watch for formalisms or well-documented categories of algorithms.</li>\n<li><strong>Expose the capabilities of the framework with an intention-revealing interface.</strong></li>\n<li>The other elements of the domain can focus on expressing the problem (“what”), delegating the intricacies of the solution (“how”) to the framework.</li>\n<li><strong>Factoring out generic subdomains reduces clutter, and cohesive mechanisms serve to encapsulate complex operations. This leaves behind a more focused model, with fewer distractions that add no particular value to how users conduct their activities.</strong></li>\n<li>You are unlikely to find good homes for everything in the domain model that is not core.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The segregated core</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>approach to structurally marking off the core domain.</li>\n<li>Refactor the model to separate the core concepts from supporting players (including ill-defined ones) and strengthen the cohesion of the core while reducing its coupling to other code.</li>\n<li>Factor all generic or supporting elements into other objects and place them into different packages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>abstract core</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The core domain model usually has so much detail that communicates the big picture.</li>\n<li>Identify the most fundamental differentiating concepts in the model and factor them into distinct classes, abstract classes, or interfaces.</li>\n<li>Design this abstract model to express most of the interaction between significant components.</li>\n<li>Place this abstract model in its own module, while the specialized, detailed implementation classes are left in their own modules defined by the subdomain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>large scale structure for strategic design</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A “large-scale structure” is a language that lets you discuss and understand the system in broad strokes. A set of high-level concepts or rules, or both, establishes a pattern of design for an entire system.</li>\n<li><strong>Devise a pattern of rules or roles and relationships that will span the entire system and allow some understanding of each part’s place in the whole-even without detailed knowledge of the part’s responsibility.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>evolving order</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Architectures can straitjacket a project with up-front design assumptions and take too much power away from the developers/designers of particular application parts. Soon, developers/designers of specific details of the applications will dumb down the application to fit the structure, or they will subvert it and have no structure, bringing back the problems of uncoordinated development.</li>\n<li>Let this large-scale conceptual structure evolve with the application, possibly changing to a completely different type of structure along the way. Don’t constraint the detailed design and model decisions that must be made with thorough knowledge.</li>\n<li>The large-scale structure should be applied when a structure can be found that dramatically clarifies the system without forcing unnatural constraints on model development. Because an ill-fitting structure is worse than none, it is best not to shoot for comprehensiveness but rather to find a minimal set that solves the emerging problem. Less is more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>system metaphor</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>software designs tend to be abstract and hard to grasp. Developers and users alike need tangible ways to understand the system and share a view of the system as a whole.</li>\n<li>When a concrete analogy to the system emerges that captures the imagination of team members and seems to lead thinking in a helpful direction, adopt it as a large-scale structure.</li>\n<li>Organize the design around this metaphor and absorb it into the ubiquitous language.</li>\n<li>The system metaphor should facilitate communication about the system and guide the development. This increases consistency in different system parts, potentially even across different bounded contexts.</li>\n<li>Because all metaphors are inexact, continually reexamine the metaphor for overextension or inaptness, and be ready to drop it if it gets in the way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>responsibility layers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>look at the conceptual dependencies in your model and the varying rates and sources of change of different parts of your domain.</li>\n<li>If you identify natural strata in the domain, cast them as broad abstract responsibilities.</li>\n<li><strong>These responsibilities should tell a story of your system’s high-level purpose and design.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Refactor the model so that the responsibilities of each domain object, aggregate, and module fit neatly within the responsibility of one layer.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>knowledge level</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>a group of objects that describe how another group of objects should behave.</li>\n<li>Create a distinct set of objects that can define and constrain the structure and behaviour of the basic model.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep these concerns separate as 2 “levels,” one very concrete, the other reflecting rules and knowledge that a user or super-user can customize.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pluggable component framework</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>a pluggable component framework usually only comes into play after a few applications have already been implemented in the same domain.</li>\n<li>Distill an abstract core of interfaces and interactions and create a framework that allows diverse implementations of those interfaces to be freely substituted. Likewise, it will enable any application to use those components, so long as it operates strictly through the interfaces of the abstract core.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a href=\"/ddd-with-legacy-code\">DD with legacy code</a></h1>\n<h1>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“Sub-domain is a problem space concept, Bounded context is a solution space concept.”</p>\n<p>“As software developers, we fail in two ways: We build the thing wrong, or we build the wrong thing.”</p>\n<p>“A project faces serious problems when its language is fractured.”</p>\n<p>“Integration is always expensive, and sometimes the benefit is small.”</p>\n<p>“Architectures can straitjacket a project with up-front design assumptions and take too much power away from the developers/designers of particular parts of the application.

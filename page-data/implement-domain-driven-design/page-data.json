The code become the expression of the model, so a change to the code may be a change to the model. its effect must ripple through the rest of the project’s activities accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To tie implementation slavishly to a model usually requires software development tools and languages that support a modeling paradigm, such as object-oriented programming.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The underlying model of the system should be the same model shown to users. Otherwise, confusion will arise and the language will not be descriptive enough. Having different models can also cause unexpected behaviors to the users. An example to that is how Microsoft Internet Explorer modeled the bookmarks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the user, “Favorites” was a list of URLs but to the actual implementation a “Favorite” is a file that contains a URL. This meant that URL names had to follow windows file naming restrictions. So if a user saved a URL and named it “AOT: 3” they will get an error stating that file names cannot contain special characters like ”:” which is very confusing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DDD_Model_Exploration_Whirlpool.png\">model exploration whirlpool</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if the people who write the code do not feel responsible for the model, or don’t understand how to make the model work for an application, then the model has nothing to do with the software. If developers don’t realize that changing code changes the model, then their refactoring will weaken the model rather than strengthen it. Meanwhile, when a modeler is separated from the implementation process, he or she never acquires, or quickly loses, a feel for the constraints of implementation. The basic constraint of MODEL-DRIVEN-DESIGN - that the model supports an effective implementation and abstracts key domain knowledge - is half gone, and the resulting models will be impractical. Finally, the knowledge and skills of experienced designers won’t be transferred to other developers if the division of labor prevents the kind of collaboration that conveys the subtleties of coding a MODEL-DRIVEN-DESIGN.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>any technical person contributing to the model must spend some time touching the code, whatever primary role he or she plays on the project. Anyone responsible for changing the model must learn to express a model through the code. Every developer must be involved in some level of discussion about the model and have contact with domain experts. Those who contribute to different ways must consciously engage those who touch the code in a dynamic exchange of model ideas through the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"layered-architecture\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#layered-architecture\" aria-label=\"layered architecture permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>layered architecture</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>isolate the expression of the domain model and the business logic, and eliminate any dependency on infrastructure, user interface, or even application reason that is not business logic.

A year later, the team found itself bogged down unable to deliver the second version due to complexity in business logic.</li>\n<li>project 2 has incisive model, repeatedly refined and expressed in code, as the team gained new insight into the new domain, the model deepened. The quality of communication improved not only among developers, but also between developers and domain experts, and the design, far from imposing an ever heavier maintenance burden, became easier to modify and extend.</li>\n<li>project 3 involves teams with good tools and good understanding of business and it gave careful attention to modeling. But a poorly chosen separation of developer roles disconnected modeling from implementation, so that the design did not reflect the deep analysis that was going on. Repeated iteration produced no improvement in code, due to uneven skill levels among developers, who had no awareness of the informal body of style and technique for creating model-based objects that also function as practical running software. As months rolled by, development work became mired in complexity and the team lost its cohesive vision of the system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a domain model is not a particular diagram, it is the idea that the diagram is intended to convey.

Design is how it works</p>\n<p>People think that design is styling. Design is not style. It’s not about giving shape to the shell and not giving a damn about the guts. Good design is a renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need, and beauty to produce something that the world didn’t know it was missing.</p>\n<p>design is intelligence made visible</p>\n<p>[Design is] a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose.</p>\n<p>What is design? it’s where you stand with a foot in 2 worlds - the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes - and you try to bring the 2 together.</p>\n<p>Design isn’t just to satisfy requirements, but also to uncover requirements.</p>\n<p>perfection is not reached when there is nothing to be added anymore, but when there is nothing to be left out anymore.</p>\n<p>the design process, at its best, integrates the aspirations of art, science, and culture.</p>\n<p>to say that something is designed means it has intentions that go beyond its function. Otherwise, it’s just planning.</p>\n<p>good design defuses the tension between functional and aesthetic goals precisely because it works within the boundaries defined by the functional requirements of communication problem. Unlike the fine arts, which exists for their own sake, design must always solve a particular real-world problem.</p>\n<p>in practice, designing seems to proceed by oscillating between sub-solution and sub-problem areas, as well as decomposing the problem and combining sub-solutions.</p>\n<p>when you specify something to be designed, tell what properties you need, not how they are to be achieved.</p>\n<p>the trick is to hold “process” off long enough to permit great design to occur, so that the lesser issues can be debated once the great design is on the table - rather than smothering it in the cradle.</p>\n<p>good design is good business</p>\n<p>if you think it’s expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur</p>\n<p>design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all… good design must primarily serve people.</p>\n<p>questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point: design is inevitable. The alternative to good design is bad design, not no design at all. Everyone makes design decisions all the time without realizing it - like Moliere’s M. Jourdain who discovered he had been speaking prose all his life, and good design is simply the result of making these decisions consciously, at the right stage, and in consultation with others as the need arises.</p>\n<p>a good design is not the one that correctly predicts the future, it’s one that makes adapting to the future affordable</p>\n<p>everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.</p>\n<p>it’s very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better.</p>\n<p>we’ve probably designed 4000 products at IDEO over my career, and for every one of them I’d like to send a little note with it that says, “I’m sorry that it’s in this present state.

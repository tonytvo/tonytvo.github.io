They differ from ordinary dialogues because the opinions of the participants vary, their emotions are high and the stakes are significant. The way you deal with these important discussions can have a positive or negative result and change the course of your life. Some examples of crucial conversations include breaking up or reconciling with a partner, giving your boss feedback or asking for a pay rise. Often, people shy away from such conversations or handle them poorly. The best way to deal with such situations is to face up to the conversation and handle it with skill.</li>\n<li>Research with more than 20,000 people in hundreds of organizations showed that influential people – those who have successfully achieved their goals and built strong personal and professional relationships – develop an ability to handle crucial conversations effectively. They are skilled in discussing difficult, controversial, high-stakes topics. Cultivating that ability will improve your career prospects, your relationships and even your health. You will increase the level of productivity in your company, because you will be better equipped to deal with challenging working relationship topics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"to-excel-at-crucial-conversations-you-must-master-the-art-of-engaging-in-dialogue\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#to-excel-at-crucial-conversations-you-must-master-the-art-of-engaging-in-dialogue\" aria-label=\"to excel at crucial conversations you must master the art of engaging in dialogue permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>To excel at crucial conversations, you must master the art of engaging in dialogue.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>At the heart of mastering crucial conversations is the ability to engage in dialogue. Essentially, this means you are able to open an interaction and converse freely with another person.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For example, a corporate vice president once had reservations about the CEO’s wish to move to a new location. Others in the firm feared the move, but also were afraid to speak up. At a crucial meeting, the VP expressed his concerns in a quiet yet powerfully diplomatic way. The CEO then realized that he had been trying to force his opinion on others and gracefully backed down.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since a successful conversation depends upon the participants providing information and sharing knowledge, sharing information actually leads to smarter decisions. Even the smartest people are more prone to making mistakes when they don’t have all the necessary information available to them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"to-elicit-more-information-so-you-can-make-better-decisions-create-a-shared-pool-of-ideas-and-understandings\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#to-elicit-more-information-so-you-can-make-better-decisions-create-a-shared-pool-of-ideas-and-understandings\" aria-label=\"to elicit more information so you can make better decisions create a shared pool of ideas and understandings permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>To elicit more information so you can make better decisions, create a “shared pool” of ideas and understandings.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>When two or more people enter into a crucial conversation, they don’t share the same thoughts and opinions. Masters of dialogue create an atmosphere where everyone feels safe about adding his or her own views to the shared pool of ideas being expressed. Even if someone’s ideas seem wrong, step out of line with prevailing beliefs or provoke controversy, he or she should feel free to articulate them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Creating this “Pool of Shared Meaning” enables people to make better choices and decisions, since they have more accurate, relevant input and information. The process may take time, but the decision will be more valuable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When people participate in shaping the meaning of an event, they are more willing to implement its outcome. They act faster and with more commitment. Building this pool of shared meaning by making it safe for others to open up and express themselves is the key to engaging in dialogue in a crucial conversation. Keep your own goals and interests in mind so you can guide the dialogue toward those goals, while also considering what others want.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Furthermore, people are more likely to fully commit to solutions resulting from an open dialogue where ideas and information are freely shared. When we can see how a solution has been distilled from the available ideas, we’re more likely to be convinced that it’s the best solution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conversely, we tend to resist decisions made without our consultation. In fact, we’re more likely to commit to ideas that we don’t agree with as long as we can participate in the discussion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"to-promote-effective-dialogue-make-everyone-feel-safe-in-expressing-what-they-really-want-to-say\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#to-promote-effective-dialogue-make-everyone-feel-safe-in-expressing-what-they-really-want-to-say\" aria-label=\"to promote effective dialogue make everyone feel safe in expressing what they really want to say permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>To promote effective dialogue, make everyone feel safe in expressing what they really want to say.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>So how do you master the art of fruitful dialogue? The first step is to “take a long hard look at yourself” and your style of conversing. Then “start with heart.” This means making sure you are engaging in a crucial conversation for all the right reasons and concentrating on your goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"focus-on-what-you-really-want-to-achieve-in-order-to-create-a-productive-dialogue\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#focus-on-what-you-really-want-to-achieve-in-order-to-create-a-productive-dialogue\" aria-label=\"focus on what you really want to achieve in order to create a productive dialogue permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Focus on what you really want to achieve in order to create a productive dialogue.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Keep your focus in one of two ways: First, know exactly what you want. This centers your concentration on your goals. When you are engaged in a crucial conversation, you need to ask what you want for yourself, for others and for your relationship with the other parties in the discussion. Look to your personal code, your “North Star,” for guidance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second, avoid the “Sucker’s Choice” trap. This occurs when you think you can only choose between two bad options, A and B. However, a better choice, C, is usually available through dialogue if you focus on what you want to achieve.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In order to prevent yourself from becoming overly emotional, take a brief moment to focus on what it is you want to achieve from the dialogue. Ask yourself questions like: What is my aim here? What information do I want to ensure I clearly articulate to my conversational partner?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After having identified what you really want from the conversation, you can shift your focus to identifying what you really don’t want. In other words, what is the one thing you really want to avoid in a conversation? You’re liable to want to avoid walking away from it empty-handed ‒ otherwise you wouldn’t be engaging in a dialogue to begin with!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For example, if you want to tell your partner something that might upset them, think: What do I actually want? What do I want to avoid? This simple exercise can help you rationally convey information and keep everyone calm, thus allowing you to say what needs to be said without risking a flying vase to the face.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"recognize-a-crucial-conversation-by-noting-certain-physical-emotional-and-behavioral-signs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#recognize-a-crucial-conversation-by-noting-certain-physical-emotional-and-behavioral-signs\" aria-label=\"recognize a crucial conversation by noting certain physical emotional and behavioral signs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Recognize a crucial conversation by noting certain physical, emotional and behavioral signs.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>To know when a crucial conversation is looming, you must learn to watch out for signs that your discussion is becoming unhealthy. Pay attention to the “content of the conversation” while simultaneously perceiving the “conditions,” such as other participants’ actions, reactions and tone of voice. This pre-emptive protective measure is a form of “social first aid.” To invoke the dialogue process successfully, respond quickly – before emotions mount – to keep it from turning into a casualty case. Avoid engaging in a high-stakes exchange that turns into an argument.</li>\n<li>Three key signs will tell you that it is time to act before the conversation becomes a problem:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your discussion involves high stakes, heightened emotions and differing opinions</strong> – These are sure signs that your conversation is becoming crucial. Look for physical signals, such as your stomach tightening up; for emotional signals, such as feeling scared, hurt or angry; or for behavior cues, such as raising your voice or pointing your finger.</li>\n<li><strong>People show signs that they feel unsafe</strong> – They may become silent or reluctant to speak their mind to protect themselves. Alternatively, they may show signs of aggression, which can manifest itself in name calling, or threatening and domineering behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>You feel yourself becoming stressed</strong> – Take heed if you react silently (by masking your feelings or withdrawing) or violently (by being overly controlling or verbally attacking the person with whom you are speaking).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>people display telltale signs of aggression when they’re feeling unsafe in a conversation. In fact, these behaviors can typically be broken down into two categories: silent and violent\n<ul>\n<li>You can identify a silent reaction when people start to deliberately hide their opinions in a conversation. A good example of this is sarcasm, in which an opinion is deliberately (and obviously) hidden. For instance, someone might tell you, “Wow, what a flattering shirt! No one will ever think that it’s three sizes too small for you!”</li>\n<li>You can identify a silent reaction when people start to deliberately hide their opinions in a conversation.

Construct a sense of security when others fall silent or seem to be moving toward anger or violence. Once you see either condition developing, remove yourself from the conversation. Let tensions cool and try to return to a starting point of mutual concerns.</li>\n<li>When everyone feels safe again, return to the issue at hand. Two major safety risks can occur, and they require different responses. The first is “mutual purpose,” which can be a casualty of a crucial conversation if others believe you have “malicious intent,” or think you want to harm them. Then they won’t trust your motives. In response, look for a united purpose so that others will be willing to listen to your concerns. For example, try to explain to your boss how his behavior may be hampering productivity.</li>\n<li>The second major safety risk, “mutual respect,” manifests when people sense you are being insolent toward them. As a result, they start to defend their dignity. In response, apologize for any action that may have shown contempt and emphasize that you do respect them.</li>\n<li>Consider this case: A team of factory employees have worked through the night to prepare for a site visit from the division vice president. When the VP arrives, he wants to meet with you to discuss the future of the firm rather than conduct a tour of the plant. You have not communicated this change of plan to the expectant workers, who now have labored through the night for no reason. When you come face-to-face with them, they irately confront you. “That’s the last time we’re busting our hump for you,” they assert. How should you react? Don’t go on the defensive. Step back and think. Realize that the workers’ anger is a “sign of violated safety.” If you feel mutual intent or mutual respect have gone awry, apologize for the misunderstanding.</li>\n<li>Reinforce your sentiments by using the “contrast technique.” This involves first saying what you did not mean to communicate and then following it up with your intended meaning. For instance, “The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don’t value your work…I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular.” Explain what you really want. If you are arguing at cross purposes, use the CRIB technique to frame a mutual purpose: “Commit” to find a mutual purpose, “recognize” an existing purpose or “invent” a new one, and “brainstorm” new approaches and strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"control-your-emotions-in-a-dialogue-to-stay-on-task\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#control-your-emotions-in-a-dialogue-to-stay-on-task\" aria-label=\"control your emotions in a dialogue to stay on task permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Control your emotions in a dialogue to stay on task.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When you get annoyed, you are reacting to external events. Therefore, it is you who are making yourself mad, not anybody else. “You and only you create your emotions.” Master your feelings when you are angry, afraid or hurt by following these four steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“See/hear”</strong> – Start with the facts as you understand them.</li>\n<li><strong>“Tell a story”</strong> – Explain to yourself what’s happening.</li>\n<li><strong>“Feel”</strong> – Experience certain emotions in response to this knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>“Act”</strong> – Take steps based on your feelings and understandings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To gain complete control over your emotions, retrace this path, one step at a time.

Recognize your role and motives in creating problems.  Beware especially of three kinds of tales:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“Victim sagas”</strong> – You claim another person is harming you and is at fault.</li>\n<li><strong>“Villain stories”</strong> – You see the other person as having negative motives.</li>\n<li><strong>“Helpless stories”</strong> – You depict yourself as unable to resolve a problem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To get what you want, replace stories that trigger negative emotions with stories that provoke positive feelings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Manage your emotions by ensuring that you’ve gotten the facts straight before you interpret</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ask yourself whether you’re misinterpreting someone’s words whenever you start to feel your emotions flare up. And be sure to separate your explanation from your emotional response so you can stay level-headed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"state-what-you-want-explore-what-others-need-and-move-onward-to-action\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#state-what-you-want-explore-what-others-need-and-move-onward-to-action\" aria-label=\"state what you want explore what others need and move onward to action permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>State what you want, explore what others need and move onward to action.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Now that you have reined in your emotions, you can effectively express your position. Speak to persuade others, but don’t be abrasive, especially when you are involved in controversial or risky discussions. Share your information with confidence, humility and skill. When you are confident, you can speak candidly to say what needs to be said. Humility demonstrates your openness to other people’s opinions, and skill is your ability to speak about touchy subjects with honesty.</li>\n<li>Use the “STATE” acronym as a guide in knowing what to say and how: “Share” what you know to be true, “Tell” the story you want to present, “Ask” others to express their stories or paths, “Talk” cautiously and “Encourage” others to speak so you can test the impact your views had on your audience.</li>\n<li>Mastering crucial conversations also involves listening to others, even when they blow up in anger or shut down in silence. First, ask them to express their point of view. Then (metaphorically) “hold a mirror up to them” to show how you are perceiving their argument – including body language and tone or voice. Calmly “paraphrase” what you have heard. This creates safety. If you feel the conversation is going nowhere, “prime” the other person into opening up by stating what you believe others may be thinking.</li>\n<li>Remember your ABC’s: “Agree” with others where you can, “Build” on what has been said with more complete information and “Compare” your path with the other party’s path.</li>\n<li><strong>Make others feel safe in a conversation by creating an atmosphere where they feel their opinions are valued</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Start by showing your conversation partner that you care about what’s making them unhappy. Ask them about their motives and, where necessary, confront them on their behavior</li>\n<li>Once they start to open up, encourage them to go on by paraphrasing what they’ve said.</li>\n<li>Sometimes, however, you might be in a position where you disagree with what your conversation partner tells you.

As you imagine how the conversation might play out, do you feel queasy and apprehensive? This is a normal reaction, but avoiding difficult conversations is not the solution. In fact, often it will make things worse. Yet, experience tells you that having the conversation will create a very uncomfortable situation. You wrestle with different approaches and look for just the right diplomatic language to avoid a confrontation.</li>\n<li>However, certain methods can help you deal with this circumstance. Every conversation has a three-part structure, even if the participants don’t realize that such an underlying framework exists. The structure is built on conversations within the conversation. Understanding these internal conversations can help you avoid the pain of letting difficult talks run their usual course.</li>\n<li>The first part of a conversation is “What Happened?” This section, which is about assigning blame and fault, and asserting dominance, can lead to struggles and bad feelings.</li>\n<li>The second part is about “Feelings.” Whose feelings are appropriate? Do you have a right to your feelings? Do other people have a right to theirs? Often, the conversation does not specifically address the participants’ feelings, but these emotions inform it, and determine its intensity and course.</li>\n<li>The third part is about “Identity,” which is internal to each person. Are you right or wrong? Are you to blame? Do you deserve love?</li>\n<li>If the conversation threatens your sense of self, shifting your stance to try to regain your balance is natural, even if it does not help the outcome of the conversation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“When disagreement occurs, arguing may seem natural, even reasonable.

We disagree with people all the time, and often no one cares very much.”</p>\n<p>“Our initial purpose for having a difficult conversation is often to prove a point, to give a piece of our mind, or to get others to do what we want.

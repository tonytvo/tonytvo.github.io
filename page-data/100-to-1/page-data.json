Say it earns a 20 percent return on its capital in one year. A 20 percent return implies $20 in earnings. But the key to a really great idea would be a business that could then take that $20 and reinvest it alongside the original $100 and earn a 20 percent return again and again and again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway said, Over the long term, it’s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you’re not going to make much different than a 6% return—even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you’ll end up with a fine result.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s not the ROE only factor because high-ROE companies can still be lousy investments .</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"reinvestmentconsistent-high-roeroce\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reinvestmentconsistent-high-roeroce\" aria-label=\"reinvestmentconsistent high roeroce permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>REINVESTMENT+CONSISTENT HIGH ROE/ROCE</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I would instead emphasize looking for high returns on capital and the ability to reinvest and produce high returns for years and years</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, we should prefer a company that can reinvest all of its earnings at a high clip. If it pays a dividend, that’s less capital that it has to reinvest. And that reduces the rate of return</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consistent ROE shows management’s skill to reinvest as explained below</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say we have a business with $100 million in equity, and we make a $20 million profit. That’s a 20 percent ROE. There is no dividend. If we took that $20 million at the end of the year and just put it in the bank, we’d earn, say, 2 percent interest on that money. But the rest of the business would continue to earn a 20 percent ROE. “That 20 percent ROE will actually come down to about 17 percent in the first year and then 15 percent as the cash earning a 2 percent return blends in with the business earning a 20 percent return,”</li>\n<li>“So when you see a company that has an ROE of 20 percent year after year, somebody is taking the profit at the end of the year and recycling back in the business so that ROE can stay right where it is.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A lot of people don’t appreciate how important the ability to reinvest those profits and earn a high ROE is.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jason told me when he talks to management, this is the main thing he wants to talk about: How are you investing the cash the business generates</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ROE doesn’t have to be a straight line. Jason used the example of Schlumberger, an oil-and-gas-services firm. He’ll use what he calls “through-the-cycle ROE.” If in an off year ROE is 10 percent, and in a good year it’s 30 percent, then that counts as a 20 percent average. “I’m comfortable buying that kind of stock,” Jason said,</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"dont-focus-for-small-gains-only-focus-for-100-baggers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#dont-focus-for-small-gains-only-focus-for-100-baggers\" aria-label=\"dont focus for small gains only focus for 100 baggers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>DONT FOCUS FOR SMALL GAINS ONLY FOCUS FOR 100 BAGGERS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>5 reasons why going for 100  bagger not as risky as aiming for lower returns</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Always a market for the best of anything – people will always pay up for quality</strong> … That is as true of stocks and bonds as it is of real estate and antiques.</li>\n<li>Buying for max long-term growth avoids the pitfall of underestimating other people</li>\n<li>When you buy a stock with a superior profit margin, an above-average rate of return on invested capital, and sales that are growing faster than the industry’s or the country as a whole, you have time on your side.</li>\n<li><em>In real life anyone smart enough to make a better mouse trap would not stop there</em></li>\n<li><strong>Don’t buy a stock in hope that it will change, buy if you love it the way it is</strong>. <em>“Don’t marry a man to reform him,” a wise mother counselled her daughter.

I think it brings the alignment with shareholders closer together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Basic economic principals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All market value is in the mind.</li>\n<li>All laws made by men, can be changed by men, will be changed by men as soon as people decide that they would be better off if the laws are changed.</li>\n<li>No one’s title or right to property is worth anymore than his fellow creatures willingness to defend it.</li>\n<li>If a company seems to be operating in ignorance or defiance of these 3 principles, don’t stop and figure – RUN.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ask yourself if the company you plan to invest into is going to make the world a better place.

Diligence and integrity also vital</li>\n<li>Beware egonomics and an aging business getting comfortable / complacent</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The moral cancer thus introduced cannot be extirpated simply by removing the evil genius at the top. It may take a generation under a good management to purge the organization of the unprincipled sharp-shooter brought in by a bad management. Hence it is unwise to look for a quick turnaround in an organization whose management has demonstrated a lack of moral principle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>investing more and more is just a people business and that management is critically important for a couple of reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One of my favorite Buffett quotes is the one where he talks about a CEO who is on a job for 10 years and he’s allocating 10% of the profits so whatever, it comes to an enormous number that that CEO is responsible for allocating that capital. That’s very important and has a big impact on returns. The honesty of management, if there’s any question about management, if there’s anything in their history that gives you pause, I would not mess with it because the market’s always going to test you.</li>\n<li>Management’s definitely very, very important. I spent a lot of time trying to evaluate the track record there and the integrity of the people involved.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Families are generally a positive when there’s large family ownership in the business. There’s empirical research on this too that families, in general, are good stewards of capital because they tend to be less levered and less aggressive. They are more willing to invest long-term and not play the quarterly earnings game.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A lot of times in broader history, families transitions don’t really go so well but there are always exceptions. For example, John Elkann of Exor, who has shown he’s a pretty good capital allocator, a pretty good manager, and he was groomed for that role very young. I think that’s one way to look at it is to say, “Has this person been involved in the business when they were very young?

Not just ones that are there for the profit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The corporate economist thinks of making the company bigger than more profitable. When you see a company delivering a low return on capital and continuing capital expenditure year on year to improve market share – you probably are dealing with a corporate economist.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usually the market pays what you might call an entertainment tax, a premium, for stocks with an exciting story.

But none of these approaches always beats the market. Even the best lag it, and often.</li>\n<li>As an individual, though, you have a great advantage in that you can ignore the benchmark chasing.</li>\n<li>Keep that in mind before you reshuffle your portfolio after looking at year-end results. Don’t chase returns! And don’t measure yourself against the S&#x26;P 500 or any other benchmark. Just focus on trying to buy right and hold on</li>\n<li>Invest like a Dealmaker.</li>\n<li>Most people chase returns. As an example, consider one of my favorite studies of all time, by Dalbar. It showed that the average mutual fund earned a return of 13.8 percent per year over the length of the study. Yet the average investor in those funds earned just 7 percent. Why? Because they took their money out after funds did poorly and put it back in after they had done well. Investors were constantly chasing returns</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>DO IGNORE FORECASTERS</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One large study covered nearly 95,000 consensus estimates from more than two decades.

Digging deeper, he finds the analysts made consistent errors in one direction: they were too optimistic</li>\n<li>So if you put the two together, you quickly come to realize the odds of you owning a stock that doesn’t suffer a negative earnings surprise is pretty small.</li>\n<li>Many people spend a great deal of time trying to guess where the economy or the stock market is going. And yet, there are countless studies that show the folly of such forecasting</li>\n<li>They have missed every recession in the last four decades</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>IGNORE MACRO</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a world of noise out there. The financial media is particularly bad. Every day, something important happens, or so they would have you believe.\n<ul>\n<li>They narrate every twist in the market.</li>\n<li>They cover every Fed meeting.</li>\n<li>They document the endless stream of economic data and reports.</li>\n<li>They give a platform for an unending parade of pundits.</li>\n<li>Everybody wants to try to call the market, or</li>\n<li>They predict where interest rates will go or</li>\n<li>They predict the price of oil or whatever.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>MARKET CRASH-HUGE OPPORTUNITY</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2008 like disasters create “easier” opportunities to make hundredfold returns</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>avoid companies with lots of debt.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>avoid companies that are really deeply cyclical. I’m not going to be interested in say mining companies, or I’m not going to spend a lot of time looking at tanker stocks, or these heavy industrial, very cyclical names where you look at their performance over the last 10 years. I’m not going to invest in say little biotech names with one or two drugs,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I don’t have a skill set in that area so that’s easy to kill.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are a lot of businesses that are not really that good they’re just mediocre. When you see businesses their return on assets is low single digits, the only way they get into a double-digit return on equity is they’re using a lot of debt. Businesses that don’t really have much of competitive advantage for there are lots of competitors and it’s nothing particularly special about it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if there’s any whiff of that there might be some fraud or any whiff that there are accounting issues, I stay away from those, overly complicated things.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally, I’ve been reluctant to get involved with roll-ups, where these companies do a lot of acquisitions but I’ve changed that recently. As I wrote down the blog, there are some companies that have been very skilled at acquiring lots of companies, Constellation Software is one that I’ve written about I do not own. HEICO, of course, is another skill acquired. Brown &#x26; Brown is an insurance broker that I own, has proven to be a very good acquisition over a long period of time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>check if a company is earning a pretty stable return on invested capital over that time (last 10 years), or look at some return metrics ROA, ROE, ROI, CEOs</li>\n<li>companies constantly writing down those acquisitions and three or four years later, they’re writing them down. This company is probably not doing a good job on acquisitions</li>\n<li>company that’s doing a lot of acquisitions and over time you see slow degradation in returns on capital, that would also be a sign that they’re not doing such a good job.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if a full position is something around eight or nine or 10. Say between eight and nine. Then I might start something around three or four and then quickly get it to three or four.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>some money managers who just like to even take very small positions maybe 1% or 2% just because they know that now they own it, it raises their awareness to another level</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"dividends\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#dividends\" aria-label=\"dividends permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>DIVIDENDS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t scoff at dividends when you are looking at capital gains as, the route through highest capital gains is often though valuation based on dividends.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When a company pays a dividend, it has that much less capital to reinvest. Instead, you have it in your pocket—after paying taxes. Ideally, you want to find a company that can reinvest those dollars at a high rate of ROE . You wind up with a bigger pile at the end of the day and pay less in taxes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the company had paid dividends, the story would be quite different. Say it paid out one-third of its earnings. It would then take 15 years to quadruple its capital, not 10.

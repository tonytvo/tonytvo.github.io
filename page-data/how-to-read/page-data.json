Look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pictures, diagrams, and any images.</li>\n<li>Bold and italicized words.</li>\n<li>Section headings</li>\n<li>Summaries.</li>\n<li>Questions at the end of the chapter.</li>\n<li>Doing a picture walk of a chapter before you read it gives you the helicopter view of what the chapter is about. When I train leaders, I advise them to preview the entire book before they read. The focus is not on one chapter at a time, but on the entire book. In the book, you’re advised to zone out to solve a problem. This is consistent with the information on problem-solving and creativity models</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there’s a difference between reading for understanding and reading for information</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lots of people confuse knowing the name of something with understanding. While great for exercising your memory, regurgitating facts without solid understanding and context gains you little in the real world.</li>\n<li><strong>anything easily digested is reading for information.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://fs.blog/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/\">work required to have an opinion</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if you’re a knowledge worker, you’re paid to use your brain, so it’s in your best interest to make that brain as efficient as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The number of pages you read is not as important as the fact you’re enjoying it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>review the notes and highlight them often with post-reading apps such as readwise.io</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>skim a lot of books and read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>when you lose interest, give it five more pages. Then skim the next chapter. If you’re still not interested, put it down. It’s the author’s job to keep your attention</li>\n<li>marking a book is indispensable to reading it\n<ul>\n<li>keep you awake, not merely conscious, but wide awake</li>\n</ul>\nIf it is active, reading is thinking and tends to express itself in words, spoken or written.\n<ul>\n<li>writing your reactions down helps you to remember the thoughts of the author</li>\n<li>an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pomodoro method</p>\n<ul>\n<li>optimal time for a task is 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. Each 25-minute chunk is called a “Pomodoro.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>skip liberally: skip anything that doesn’t interest you.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>skip, but do so intelligently\n<ul>\n<li>return to it later and ask yourself, “why did I skip this?” Did it offend you? Seem beneath you? Seem too difficult? And did you arrive at that by thinking it through, or is it a reflection of biases inherited from your parents and others? Very often, “our” beliefs are not our own</li>\n<li>This practice is how you create yourself instead of discovering yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>find your 100 favorites books and keep re-reading them</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"finding-more-time-to-read\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#finding-more-time-to-read\" aria-label=\"finding more time to read permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Finding more time to read</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>find time to read boils down to choices about how you allocate your time.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>reading isn’t something to be done once a week to check a box; it’s something to do every day</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>What gets in the way of reading?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>avoid time commuting</li>\n<li>avoid time shopping</li>\n<li>avoid watching TV</li>\n<li>combine reading with idle activities, waiting for a bus, waiting for a taxi, on the train, on the plane, waiting for your flight.</li>\n<li><strong>what I read depends on the situation</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>if there are few minutes, read something simple, rather disposable, and easily digested.</li>\n<li>early in the evening, around 8-9, read something without interruption</li>\n<li>before going to bed, read something light or something requiring more thought so I can ponder an idea while I’m falling asleep.</li>\n<li>when I’m not reading, I’m trying to think about what I have just read (like waiting in the checkout line at the grocery store)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"4-levels-of-reading\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#4-levels-of-reading\" aria-label=\"4 levels of reading permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4 levels of reading</h1>\n<h2 id=\"elementary-reading\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#elementary-reading\" aria-label=\"elementary reading permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Elementary reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>level of reading taught in our elementary schools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"inspectional-reading\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#inspectional-reading\" aria-label=\"inspectional reading permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Inspectional reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>skimming and superficial reading can be used effectively to increase understanding</li>\n<li>inspectional reading allows us to look at the author’s blueprint and evaluate the merits of a deeper reading experience.</li>\n<li>2 sub-types of inspectional reading\n<ul>\n<li>systematic skimming\n<ul>\n<li>a quick check of the book by\n<ul>\n<li>reading preface</li>\n<li>studying the table of contents</li>\n<li>checking the index</li>\n<li>reading inside the jacket</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>give you sufficient knowledge to understand the chapters in the book, pivotal to the author’s argument.</li>\n<li>skimming helps you reach a decision point: Does this book deserve more of my time and attention?

Take a couple of minutes to recall the information you’re trying to learn. This is one way you can move something from short-term memory into long-term memory. And even recalling the information in different physical environments can help your brain grasp it better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Illusions of Competence</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The best way to learn is to recall.</li>\n<li>Reduce the number of highlights. Try to understand the main idea first and then highlight. Highlighting or underlining can also lead to this illusion of learning.</li>\n<li>Notes and helpful words are great. Tests yourself.</li>\n<li>You can master a new subject by interleaving (jumping between different problems/situations, using different tools/strategies)problems/situations, use different techniques/strategies)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sleep</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Getting enough sleep is important to learning. Sleep:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleans toxic products in your brain.</li>\n<li>Erases the less important parts of memories.</li>\n<li>Strengthens areas you need or want to remember.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Concentrate intently during the day when learning. The brain changes when you learn. Practice what you learn, so you do not forget. Space your practice to remember longer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Neurons are throughout your body and not just your brain. When you learn something new, practice and get enough sleep. You grow new dendritic spines and synaptic links. The more you do this, the more it happens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I love this — practice makes it permanent. Space out your learning to allow time to sleep on it after practice. When you learn something new, practice active recall to solidify learning. Build on what you already learned. Each subject you study, give it your full attention. To learn a new subject, after you finish your reading each day, take 10 minutes to recall what you read that day.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author.

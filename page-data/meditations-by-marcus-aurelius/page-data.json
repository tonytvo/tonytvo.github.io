Live in the present moment and use your time wisely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other people are outside of your control. The best you can do is to show them. Let your deeds do the talking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If something bad happens, dig to find the gains. Don’t cling on the negative side of things.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Above all, you need to be a reasonable person. To live in harmony with nature and to make sure that you are the same person both in difficult times and in good times. When hardship enters the scene, as it will inevitably happen, to face it and act nobly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the book, Marcus Aurelius teaches us how to become just, righteous, reasonable human beings who get up every day with a desire to make the world a better place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One of his struggles, after reading this short book, I believe, is the lack of people who shared his world views. That’s probably one of the reasons he kept writing in his diary. To find clarity. To remain sane while surrounded by injustice and illogical people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ultimate lesson in the book is the following: Happiness is a byproduct of thinking and acting in ways that are just, generous, resolute, purposeful, and free of a desire for lust and more physical things. If you find meaningful tasks in your life and abstract yourself from things that are outside of your power, you’ll live a healthy and aspiring life.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The most important lesson to take away from Meditations is that our minds have great power</strong>. We can choose how we perceive events and we can always choose to be virtuous. If we practice, we can instantly erase any bad impressions from our mind. We are completely in control of our thoughts and actions. Remember the two quotes: “You have power over your mind – not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>People will always do awful (or at least unpleasant) things and we are only responsible our own virtue</strong>. We can choose to be good even when we are surrounded by wrong. When another harms us, we can react with kindness, advising them of their errors if possible but being okay with it if they ignore this advice. When another angers us, we must immediately consider their point of view, remember that we have our own faults, and respond with positivity and indifference to any supposed harm done to us.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The deepest lesson in Meditations relates to our mortality and the shortness of life.</strong> We shall soon be replaced, and we ought not waste our lives being distressed. We should focus on doing good for the others with the unknowable amount of time we have left to live. To make this a part of our lives we must reflect regularly on the fact that we will die. This can result in some of the deepest understandings available to humans, therefore death should be confronted no matter how unpleasant it may be to think about. We should reflect on all the people that have come before us, what is left of them now, and what will later be left of us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The Evil That Men Do Harms You Only if You Do Evil in Response</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Marcus reminded himself to not be upset by the misdeeds of others and to correct them if possible, but if they were stubborn and would not change, to accept it. In reacting to such people, we must never allow our own principles to be violated. Moreover, we should never be surprised by the wicked deeds of others, and avoid wishing that men are not as they are (prone to evil acts) because then we are wishing for the impossible. He believed that people do bad things out of ignorance of what is good and evil, and that we should forgive them for their errors, even when they harm us. Marcus stresses that social animals such as humans are meant to live in harmony.</p>\n<p>He likened his relation to bad people to them being different body parts of the same person. Good and bad people are both part of the same universal nature and they are meant to interact and cooperate. Marcus Aurelius—and indeed all the Stoics—believed that we were part of an inner-connected organism. That you couldn’t hurt one person without hurting them all. “What injures the hive, injures the bee,” he said. “The best revenge,” he said, “is not to be like that.” Meaning: When you hurt others, you hurt the group and you hurt yourself.</p>\n<p>It is against nature to despise evil people and try to avoid them. When we find ourselves judging others, we ought to consider our own faults first. Then we will find that we are less prone to blaming them. Rather than judge and be disturbed by others, which sets us up for disappointment and distress, we ought to focus on self-improvement. Marcus said,</p>\n<p>“It is a ridiculous thing for a man not to fly from his own badness, which is indeed possible, but to fly from other men’s badness, which is impossible.”</p>\n<p>Or as another translation would put it,</p>\n<p>“It’s silly to try to escape other people’s faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.”</p>\n<p>And today, in a hyperconnected, information driven world, compared to Marcus’s time, we also know a lot about other people. We know about the comings and goings of celebrities and politicians. We get real time updates on everything our friends do. We see what they say on social media and we get their texts and photos.</p>\n<p>There’s no question that this has increased the amount of so-called drama in our lives. We have opinions on whether so-and-so should have done this and we watch the media chatter about it. We get offended when our friends say this or that. Not a day goes by that we don’t hear gossip or speculation about someone we know.</p>\n<p>This is a trap. This is a distraction. Even 2,000 years ago Marcus knew this. “Other people’s mistakes?” he reminded himself, should be left to their makers.</p>\n<p>Forget what other people are doing, forget what they’re doing wrong. You’ve got enough on your plate. Focus on yourself—focus on what you might be doing wrong. Fix that. Keep an eye fixed on your own life. There’s no need—and frankly, there’s not enough time—to waste a second spying on other people.</p>\n<p>Mind your business.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Fame and Desires are Not Worth Pursuing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Marcus repeatedly explains why the pursuit of fame and praise is foolish and why we especially should not care about what others think of us after we die. He points out that so many famous men have been forgotten, that those who would praise one posthumously will themselves soon die. He explains that there are no immortal actions:</p>\n<p>“Consider that as the heaps of sand piled on one another hide the former sands, so in life the events which go before are soon covered by those which come after.”</p>\n<p>Fame, no matter how great, will always fade into oblivion and pursuit of it merely demonstrates one’s vanity.</p>\n<p>He also explains that nothing is made better by praise, the beauty of things comes from the thing itself and not what people say about it. To think then that we are gaining something by being praised is a mistake.</p>\n<p>Marcus would say,</p>\n<p>“When you’ve done well and another has benefited by it, why like a fool do you look for a third thing on top— credit for the good deed or a favor in return?”</p>\n<p>Marcus and the Stoics see doing good as the proper job of a human being. So why on earth do you need thanks or recognition for having done the right thing? It’s your job. Why would you need to be famous? Because you were talented? Because you were brilliant? Because you were successful? These things are part of the job too.</p>\n<p>The desire for fame is just one of the pitfalls in life. There are many other desires, all of which can potentially lead us to act immorally. He cites a philosopher, Theophrastus, who claims that bad acts committed because of desires are more blameworthy than evils done out of anger. A person who has been harmed was wronged, whereas the person with strong desires is ignoring the well-being of others because they want something more than they want to be virtuous. Desires can also lead to despair. Marcus addresses this when he talks about prayer, claiming that one should not asks the gods to satisfy a desire or prevent something feared, but ask them if they can remove the desire and be okay with whatever life gives to them.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The Universe is Change</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius’s strongest philosophy comes when he speaks on the eternally changing nature of the universe and the acceptance of death. He reminds us that all of us will die, however, we only ever lose the present moment because that is all we ever have. Nobody “loses more” by dying early. The longest and shortest life will end the same way and be finished for the same eternity.</p>\n<p>He also reminds us that we could die at any moment and to live to the fullest while we still can.</p>\n<p>“Not to live as if you had endless years ahead of you. Death overshadows you. While you’re alive and able — be good.”</p>\n<p>Marcus teaches that we should act quickly to get our affairs in order and take advantage of our fleeting existence and live well. “Thou wilt soon die, and thou art not yet simple, not free from perturbations, nor without suspicion of being hurt by external things, nor kindly disposed towards all; nor dost thou yet place wisdom only in acting justly.”</p>\n<p>It is the way of our world that substances should change into new things. The changing of anything into something else is never harmful to the universe, and Marcus applies that lack of harmfulness to every part of the universe, including us. “Nothing is evil which is according to nature,” he asserts.</p>\n<p>He even casts our fear of change (including our death) in a somewhat ridiculous light, saying,</p>\n<p>“Is any man afraid of change? What can take place without change? What then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature? And canst thou take a bath unless the wood undergoes a change? And canst thou be nourished, unless the food undergoes a change? And can anything else that is useful be accomplished without change?”</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Problems are Created in the Mind</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Being superior to pain and pleasure allows us to fully accept the course of nature and focus on being virtuous. Our perceptions of events as troublesome are the real source of any unhappiness we experience, not the events themselves. Marcus believed that a person could immediately wipe any upsetting impressions from their mind and be at peace. He also recommended remembering the following whenever we experience anxiety:</p>\n<p>“Let not future things disturb you, for you will come to them, if it shall be necessary, having with you the same reason which you now use for present things.”</p>\n<p>If we don’t let events make us worse people, we are never truly harmed by them. He explains it perfectly when he says,</p>\n<p>“Whatever anyone does or says, I must be good, just as if the gold, or the emerald, or the purple were always saying this, whatever anyone does or says, I must be emerald and keep my color.”</p>\n<p>Or as he put it in what would become one of the most emblematic quotes from Meditations, “Choose not to be harmed — and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed — and you haven’t been.”</p>\n<p>Events can cause people to lose their cool and act immorally, but still they are not harmed by the events, but rather their reaction to them.</p>\n<p>And when it comes to problems, we find in Marcus a formula, an art known as turning obstacles upside down. As he would write,</p>\n<p>“Our actions may be impeded … but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting.”</p>\n<p>And then he concluded with powerful words destined for maxim.</p>\n<p>“The impediment to action advances action.</p>\n<p>What stands in the way becomes the way.”*</p>\n<p>To act with “a reverse clause,” so there is always a way out or another route to get to where you need to go. So that setbacks or problems are always expected and never permanent. Making certain that what impedes us can empower us.</p>\n<p>Coming from this particular man, these were not idle words. In his own reign of some nineteen years, he would experience nearly constant war, a horrific plague, possible infidelity, an attempt at the throne by one of his closest allies, repeated and arduous travel across the empire—from Asia Minor to Syria, Egypt, Greece, and Austria—a rapidly depleting treasury, an incompetent and greedy stepbrother as co-emperor, and on and on and on.</p>\n<p>*This is the quote that inspired the bestselling cult Stoic classic, The Obstacle Is the Way. It shows how some of the most successful people in history—from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs—have applied Stoicism to overcome difficult or even impossible situations.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Your Rational Mind is Your Greatest Asset</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Marcus knew that our ability to reason is what sets us apart from the animals and is an important power that we must use to the fullest. He believed (like all Stoics) that our reason could be used to understand the universal reason present in nature, which would lead to agreement with it even if events seemed harmful. Our rational minds have complete power over our opinions and the mind only experiences suffering when it itself creates a desire for a specific outcome in life.</p>\n<p>Marcus—who had more control over his environment than most—was also the pen behind these lines: “You have power over your mind – not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”</p>\n<p>Marcus teaches that our mind is a thing that controls itself completely and is separated from the world; it cannot be affected by events unless it makes itself be affected. Every appearance is the result of what the mind wills it to appear to be and the mind makes itself exactly what it is. Since this is so, there is no reason we should not agree with nature, since nature has provided us with the means to rationally accept the course of events no matter where they take us.</p>\n<h1 id=\"all-you-have-is-the-present-moment\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#all-you-have-is-the-present-moment\" aria-label=\"all you have is the present moment permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>All You Have Is The Present Moment</h1>\n<p>Imagine what it was to live 2000 years ago – no fresh water, zero security, lack of food, continuous wars. People were surely daydreaming, hoping, for something good to happen. After all, how would anyone prevail the daily challenges if there wasn’t some sort of promise for a better future?</p>\n<p>Yet, apart from instilling hope, hoping for a better future gives you a false sense of joy and accomplishment. What you really have is now, this present moment. Nothing else.</p>\n<p>That’s what Marcus Aurelius persistently noted in his journal. He realized that moaning about the past and imagining a future where things are different, better, is just a waste of time. What we really have is the present moment. We neither hold yesterday nor have access to tomorrow. We have only now.</p>\n<p>If you fail to harness the present moment and make your daily deeds worthy, it’s irrelevant of how many years you’ve stayed on this planet. Even if you live for thousands of years, you wasted all of them if you spend your time daydreaming or doing petty tasks.</p>\n<p>“Enjoy the present moment. Expect nothing, fear nothing, speak truly, and act heroically. No one can stop you.” Marcus Aurelius</p>\n<p>Lesson #2: Accept People As They Are\nWhen we look at others, we imagine that they hold the same principles, ambitions, and intentions as we do. But when you come to think about it, you’ll easily spot how this claim is decisive.</p>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius reported the same thing in his daily journaling. He wrote the following:</p>\n<p>Begin each morning by saying to yourself: Today I will meet people who are noisy, ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, and unsocial. They can’t help it—they are ignorant of the difference between good and bad.”</p>\n<p>“How is this helping me,” you might think?</p>\n<p>Well, firstly, it will lower your bar. You’ll stop expecting wonders from others. Secondly, it will help you stay calm when you face self-absorbed characters.</p>\n<p>As a person who’s guided by reason, you should know that there are others who don’t know the stuff you do. People who don’t have ambitions, goals, and simply live to see how others fail. Such folks are ignorant of their ignorance.</p>\n<p>Hence, your task in life when you’re interacting with such conflicting characters, is to remain calm. Don’t try so hard to reason them. Convey your message using words but don’t expect grand results. And above all, don’t take it personally when they speak of you.</p>\n<p>Lesson #3: Transform Obstacles Into Opportunities\nWorthy things don’t come easy. There’s always some barrier preventing you from getting what you want. Especially if the item you wish to obtain promises more happiness, money, stability, or status. That’s why there aren’t a lot of rich, physically fit, or mentally stable people – we all have our limits and most of us give up when we continuously face bumps on our road.</p>\n<p>But there is another way to look at things. Instead of considering the obstacles we daily face as wretched, we can see them as stepping stones for our progression as people.</p>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius advises: “Is there an obstacle blocking your way? Make it part of your plan and turn it to your advantage.”</p>\n<p>Think of it like that: If a task is easily achievable, it’s not worth doing. If there are mountains of challenges ahead, you’re on the right path.</p>\n<p>Anticipate hardship. Desire suffering. That’s the only way you can “leave this world contentedly.”</p>\n<p>Lesson #4: To Change Your Experience, Change Your Opinion\nThere are no good or bad events. There are good or bad ways we frame what happens to us. It’s always you who is defining the events. You make them good or bad, delightful or awful.</p>\n<p>“But what if I was just fired from my highly paid job? That’s certainly a bad thing,” you might say.</p>\n<p>Not necessarily. There’s always a positive side. If you no longer have your cool job, you can find another one – a much better one. Start your own business. Focus on the things you always wanted. Take some time off to find yourself and your meaning. And most importantly, learn from the experience – no matter how awful and dreadful it seems.</p>\n<p>Even if there seemingly isn’t a positive thing to be found in something that just happened – say, decease of a relative. Stoics don’t focus on such matters. On events that cannot be undone. They center their attention on their opinion.</p>\n<p>“If your opinions cause you distress, change your opinions,” is mentioned a lot in the book.</p>\n<p>While it’s surely hard to practice this mantra when unfortunate events come knocking on your door, it’s the most logical and reasonable thing to do.</p>\n<p>If something bad occurs, find the positive side to tune your mind. That’s the only way you can keep going and keep your sanity.</p>\n<p>Lesson #5: You Have Three Responsibilities In LIfe\nWhile we push hard to gain more friends and more followers online, we often forget to nurture the relationships that truly matter in life. And I’m not talking about our real friends and family members (though these too matter), I’m talking about the relationship we have with our body, the universe in general, and with other human beings as a whole.</p>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius points out that we have three responsibilities in life, based on the three relationships above, that are of major importance:</p>\n<p>To be a reasonable person.\nTo accept what happens to you.\nTo be generous to others.\nHere’s a little more guidance to attend these three responsibilities:</p>\n<p>Act with reason: By default, our first response to everything is emotional. Someone just cut you off? You get angry. Your favorite show was canceled? You start crying. If you learn to pause your sensations and act with reason you’ll become a much better decision-maker.\nAmor fati: This is a principle confessed by all Stoics. In translation, amor fati means “love of fate.” Or in other words, to accept what happens to you no matter how difficult or horrifying. A true master can turn painful, humiliating events, into a beautiful piece of art.\nGenerosity to others: Part of your stay here is to help others thrive. Aid them in their journey but expect nothing in return. The act of help is its own reward.\n“And so you have three responsibilities: First, to use your reason to master your body and make right judgments; second, to gratefully accept all that happens in the universe; third, to treat all people with justice and generosity.”</p>\n<p>Actionable Notes:\nExpect less: Especially from others. Aurelius writes: “If you expect an ignorant person to act like a knowledgeable one, that’s your mistake.” Do everything in your power to teach the people around you but don’t assume wonders. At the end of the day, you control only yourself.\nYour mind is in control: If you take away all of your possessions, the fancy toys you so vividly aspire, the people around you, you’re left with a body composed of flesh and bones. But these things are nothing without the brain. Your arms and legs are obedient to your mind. Therefore, the main objective should be to direct your thoughts towards something worthy. This way the rest of the body will follow.\nManage your opinion: Along the way, distressful things will occur. If you act as you’re the victim, you won’t do much to make progress. You’ll feel pain but won’t do anything to change it. In this case, your thoughts are causing you pain. Fortunately, you can easily correct this. How? By changing your opinion. By re-framing the events happening in your head. The moment you switch from “I”m the victim” to “I can do something about this,” the sooner you’ll feel better.\nFocus on improving yourself: The only thing you can control in life is yourself – your own body and mind. There’s no point in trying to convince others of your rightfulness. So, essentially, your main duty should be to get better at what you do. Get better in your work and as a person. That’s the best way you can spend your time.\nBecome independent: The more you rely on other people and on tools to do your work, the more dependent you’ll become. Swordsman in the past were easy prey when they lost their swords. Wrestlers, on the other hand, are people who count only on their fists to beat the opponent. Aspire to become a wrestler – an independent person who relies only on his own capabilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“Ordinary men hate solitude. But the Master makes use of it, embracing his aloneness, realizing he is one with the whole universe.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>So… How’s your stillness workin’ for you? You hate it or embrace it? Can you turn off the TV or the talk radio or the Internet (+ the cell phone and iPod and …) and immerse yourself in some sacred silence today? (and tomorrow and… :)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Fame or integrity: which is more important? Money or happiness: which is more valuable?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Success or failure: which is more destructive? If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never truly be fulfilled. If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself. Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.”</p>\n<p>“The Master gives himself up to whatever the moment brings. He knows that he is going to die, and he has nothing left to hold on to: no illusions in his mind, no resistances in his body. He doesn’t think about his actions; they flow from the core of his being. He holds nothing back from life; therefore he is ready for death, as a man is ready for sleep after a good day’s work.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beautiful. Reminds me of Marcus Aurelius’ wisdom from his classic Meditations (see Notes). He advises us: “Take it that you have died today, and your life’s story is ended; and henceforward regard what future time may be given you as an uncovenanted surplus, and live it out in harmony with nature.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“A great nation is like a great man: When he makes a mistake, he realizes it. Having realized it, he admits it. Having admitted it, he corrects it. He considers those who point out his faults as his most benevolent teachers. He thinks of his enemy as the shadow that he himself casts.”</p>\n<p>“Prevent trouble before it arises. Put things in order before they exist. The giant pine tree grows from a tiny sprout. The journey of a thousand miles starts from beneath your feet.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>So… What’s your next step? All you EVER have to worry about is the next step. And the next and the …</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“The best athlete wants his opponent at his best. The best general enters the mind of his enemy. The best businessman serves the communal good. The best leader follows the will of the people. All of them embody the virtue of non-competition. Not that they don’t love to compete, but they do it in the spirit of play. In this they are like children and in harmony with the Tao.”</p>\n<p>“You are to become a creator, not a competitor; you are going to get what you want, but in such a way that when you get it every other man will have more than he has now.”</p>\n<p>“If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to.”</p>\n<p>“Trying to control the future is like trying to take the master carpenter’s place. When you handle the master carpenter’s tools, chances are that you’ll cut yourself.”</p>\n<p>the only true expression of the Tao is that which is lived, not that which is written about or discussed.</p>\n<p>2 - We live in a relative world, there is no thing that is absolute. High reveals low, short shows us long.</p>\n<p>3 - A focus on material wealth (as revealed through the concept in 2) will fill the heart with anguish and desire to be more, to want more. Do not show wealth to others, or even yourself.</p>\n<p>4 - The Tao is directly imperceptible, infinite and outlasts all. Given enough time, our greatest achievements and wonders and knowledge will all disappear.</p>\n<p>‘Too many words hasten failure / cannot compare to keeping quiet.’</p>\n<p>5 - The quietness of simplicity wins over the unnecessary and burdensome noise and busyness of bureaucracy. ‘When utilized, it is never exhausted.’</p>\n<p>6 - Life creates life and thus extends infinitely into the future.</p>\n<p>7 - Placing yourself last and ending up in front: the paradox of selflessness. If you prioritise yourself and your gains you may win something, but lose much.</p>\n<p>8 - Be like water. The nature of water is to flow into the lowest place and find its level. Being like this we respond in truth, we act with kindness to all, we move and change with the world as it changes around us without fighting it.</p>\n<p>9 - There is nothing good about an overflowing cup. With achievement and success it is best to discretely step aside, otherwise your hubris will invite problems into your life.</p>\n<p>11 - All that is useful does not always have substance. Emptiness, a lack of anything, is important. A doorway, a bottle, an arena - all are useful for the space and emptiness they create.</p>\n<p>12 - ‘The sages care for the stomach and not the eyes’; constantly striving for greater distraction and speed and wealth can leave us senseless and overloaded. Instead, take care of the simple things in life.</p>\n<p>13 - Comparison, approval, fear of disgrace… all bad habits that centre around the ego. If we let go of them and learn to love ourselves in equal measure with how we love the world then we are more likely to make our way more peacefully through life.</p>\n<p>16 - Troubles and pain are caused by a discrepancy between wanting things to be a certain way and accepting them as they are. ‘Knowing constancy’ and the true nature of how the world works is to know yourself and to know/understand the responsibility you have to guide your life with these things in mind.</p>\n<p>17 - ‘The highest rulers, people do not know they have them’. When in a leadership position, there are some means of leadership that are better than others. The best is for the people to believe they did it all themselves, the worst is to fear who leads them. Act quietly and subtly to the benefit of those you lead.</p>\n<p>19 - There are great pitfalls to knowledge. Too much of it, or an obsession with gaining more of it, can hold us back and frustrate us at every turn. It is not enough to grow your knowledge and keep your nose stuck in your books, you have to live your life and get wise that way also.</p>\n<p>22 - A position or a view or an argument does not gain strength or additional validity through defense. It merely is. To spend energy defending it is a great waste, instead yield and spend energy on something more constructive than fighting against another who holds a different view.</p>\n<p>23 - Sparse, infrequent speech is better than drawn out platitudes. In this respect, we have the agency to choose how we communicate and the mandate to determine our own thinking. Imposing discipline on our thoughts and actions, we can best determine how we move forward in life. We reap what we sow - if we think on loss, we find ourselves losing; if we think on gains, we find ourselves gaining also.</p>\n<p>26 - ‘Heaviness is the root of lightness’. While a light approach to daily troubles and happenings is a wonderful thing, many of life’s challenges should be approached with the required level of gravity. If we approach important things lightly, they will go wrong. We can only be light if we carried the heavy before. Heaviness is the root of lightness.</p>\n<p>29 - The world cannot be controlled. Those who would try, fail. Those who would grasp a thing, lose the thing. The wise instead cast off extremes, excesses and extravagances. They know the world for what it really is, a spiritual instrument.</p>\n<p>30 - Force and violence beget more of the same. If it must be used, never further than is absolutely necessary. Ideally not at all, ideally never. Instead work with courtesy and calm, consensus and teamwork.</p>\n<p>33 - ‘Those who understand others are intelligent. / Those who understand themselves are enlightened.’</p>\n<p>36 - Pride goes before fall, thus ‘If one wishes to shrink it / one must first expand it.’ Likewise, you reap what you sow in life: ‘If one wishes to seize it / one must first give it’.</p>\n<p>38 - Virtue is highest, followed by benevolence, followed by righteousness, followed by etiquette. There is high virtue, and there is low virtue: ‘Low virtue takes contrived action / And acts without agenda’. This  reminds me of Matthew 6:2, ‘So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.’ Those that proclaim their virtuous actions on social media would do well to heed this sort of advice.</p>\n<p>39 - ‘Do not wish to be shiny like jade / Be dull like rocks.’</p>\n<p>44 - ‘Excessive love must lead to great spending / Excessive hoarding must lead to heavy loss.’ The way of the Tao is contentment and knowing when to stop, and how to let go.</p>\n<p>45 - Those that have truly mastered an art or technique do not look perfect or complete to the untrained eye. Their abilities mask the long periods of work at their craft or profession. It is much like knowing someone with ‘all the gear and no idea’ who does not understand why a professional, using basic equipment, gets far better results. ‘Great skill seems unrefined / Great eloquence seems inarticulate.’</p>\n<p>46 - ‘There is no greater calamity / Than not knowing what is enough.’</p>\n<p>53 - Many think there is a quick fix or solution that can shortcut our progress through life, but there is not. That way, says the Tao, leads to barren fields, empty warehouses and charlatans parading their wealth. But this is figuratively and literally bankrupt. Better to grow slowly and consistently through repeated right action than to think you can jump ahead of the queue.</p>\n<p>54 - Live the Tao by applying it to life and rooting it deeply. Don’t just play with the ideas.</p>\n<p>55 - We are in a marathon, not a sprint. Take all in moderation. Lots to consider in this chapter.</p>\n<p>61 - Principles that work well on an interpersonal level work well on all other levels. Do not pretend that things change on different scales; it’s all human interaction after all. Treat people well on your way up, because you will surely meet them on your way down.</p>\n<p>63 - ‘Act without action / Manage without meddling’. ‘The difficult tasks of the world / Must be handled through the small tasks’. Therefore, never attempt great deeds. Instead, repeatedly do small things very well.</p>\n<p>64 - A long journey starts directly under your feet (often mistranslated as ‘a single step’.) Proceed at the end as you do at the beginning and your work won’t be ruined.</p>\n<p>66 - Power and leadership require humility to be effective. ‘Those who would be above / Must speak as if they are below / Those who would lead / Must speak as if they are behind.’</p>\n<p>67 - Three treasures of the Tao: compassion, frugality, not daring to think yourself ahead in the world. Each in their turn give access to true courage, the ability to reach far and wide and the ability to be a true leader.</p>\n<p>69 - Judo and Aikido are based on the words in this chapter. ‘I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to withdraw a foot.’</p>\n<p>70 - ‘The sage wears rough clothing, but carries jade inside.’</p>\n<p>72 - Know yourself as well as you can. Neither glorify yourself, nor bottle yourself up. These are extremes that we can push and push and push… but they will ultimately reverse on us and deal great damage within and without.</p>\n<p>75 - ‘The people’s hunger is due to the excess of their ruler’s taxation so they starve’, much the same with our own spiritual hunger if we tax ourselves too much and spend too much energy obsessed with material wealth.</p>\n<p>77 - The Tao of heaven increases the deficient and reduces the excessive. The Tao of people goes the opposite way: to those that have shall more be given, to those that have not shall it be taken away. The wise are those who know when they have enough and are capable of helping others and giving away what they have and not heaping praise onto those who have already achieved acclaim and riches.</p>\n<p>79 - Those who give in accordance with the Tao receive abundantly.</p>\n<p>II. THE ART OF SELF-REFLECTION</p>\n<p>The moment you open the first pages of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations and begin reading, you’ll be struck by the fluidity of the man’s self-reflection.</p>\n<p>Self-reflection is a trait that forms the very foundation of his thoughts. The ability to accurately self-reflect is a powerful tool for personal growth and development. It does not matter where we’re born, who we are, or where we are; it offers a window into the inner landscape of our minds and hearts, allowing us to see what’s going on in our inner world and, in doing so, giving us clarity on how we think and how we feel.</p>\n<p>In this section, we shall explore the role of self-reflection in the Meditations and unveil strategies for incorporating this transformative practice into our daily lives.</p>\n<p>SELF-REFLECTION IN MARCUS AURELIUS’ MEDITATIONS\nAt the core of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations is the practice of self-reflection, an ongoing dialogue with his innermost thoughts and emotions. By engaging in this introspective journey, the Roman Emperor sought to better understand himself and, by extension, how he could develop himself. After all, it’s difficult to grow if we don’t know what we’re working with.</p>\n<p>His writings reveal a profound awareness of his own character, as well as a commitment to personal growth and self-improvement.</p>\n<p>Through the lens of self-reflection, Marcus Aurelius confronts the complexities of human nature and his individual nature, examining the motivations, fears, and desires that drive our thoughts and actions. Through reading his work we can learn to do the same for ourselves.</p>\n<p>INCORPORATING SELF-REFLECTION IN OUR DAILY LIVES\nAs we continue to leaf through the pages written by Marcus Aurelius, we may wonder how best to incorporate the practice of self-reflection into the fabric of our modern lives. Here are a few strategies for weaving this timeless art into our own daily routines:</p>\n<p>Set aside time: Firstly we must dedicate a specific time each day for self-reflection, whether it be in the morning with a cup of tea, during a lunchtime walk, or in the evening as you unwind from the day’s activities. By establishing a consistent routine, we create a sacred space for introspection and growth.</p>\n<p>Keep a journal: Just as Marcus Aurelius recorded his thoughts in the Meditations, consider keeping a journal to capture your own reflections. This practice not only helps to crystallize our ideas but also serves as a tangible reminder of our personal development over time.</p>\n<p>Engage in mindful meditation: Mindfulness meditation can be a powerful catalyst for self-reflection, as it encourages us to observe our thoughts and emotions without judgment. By cultivating a heightened sense of self-awareness, we become better equipped to navigate the inner landscape of our minds.</p>\n<p>Seek solitude: In our hyperconnected world, it can be difficult to find moments of quiet and solitude. However, it is in these moments of stillness that we can truly engage with our inner selves. Carve out time for solitude, whether it be through a walk in nature, a quiet corner at home, or even a brief respite during the workday.</p>\n<p>If we spend the time to embrace a little self-reflection, as exemplified by Marcus Aurelius, we open ourselves to the potential of rapid personal growth and self-discovery.</p>\n<p>“When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive-to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.”</p>\n<p>―Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</p>\n<p>Page Break Image of a Greek Temple</p>\n<p>III. EMBRACING THE DICHOTOMY OF CONTROL\nJourneying further into the depths of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, we encounter one of the most powerful and enduring tenets of Stoic philosophy: the dichotomy of control.</p>\n<p>Often attributed to the excellent work of Epictetus, this dichotomy is the learning to distinguish between what lies within our power and what does not. This, when applied correctly, unlocks the door to a life of greater serenity, self-mastery, and empowerment.</p>\n<p>In this section, we shall explore Marcus Aurelius’ teachings on the dichotomy of control and unveil practical applications of this transformative wisdom in our modern lives.</p>\n<p>“You have power over your mind – not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”</p>\n<p>―Marcus Aurelius</p>\n<p>UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS WITHIN OUR CONTROL AND WHAT IS NOT\nIn his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius repeatedly emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limits of our control. He teaches us that while we cannot dictate the external circumstances of our lives, we possess the power to shape our inner responses to those circumstances.</p>\n<p>Through learning to focus our energy on what we can control – our thoughts, emotions, and actions – we liberate ourselves from the shackles of worry and anxiety that so often accompany our futile attempts to control the uncontrollable.</p>\n<p>This dichotomy of control serves as a cornerstone of Stoic philosophy, guiding us towards a life of greater tranquility and self-mastery.</p>\n<p>PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE DICHOTOMY OF CONTROL IN MODERN LIFE\nIn our fast-paced, ever-changing world, the dichotomy of control can be a powerful antidote to the stress and uncertainty that so often pervade our lives.</p>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius and his teachings give us a practice we can use to transform our approach to the challenges we face, nurturing a sense of empowerment and serenity. Here are a few practical applications of the dichotomy of control to consider:</p>\n<p>Responding to adversity: When faced with setbacks or obstacles, focus on the aspects that you can control, such as your attitude, effort, and response. By doing so, you can transform adversity into an opportunity for growth and learning.</p>\n<p>Managing relationships: In our interactions with others, we often encounter situations that test our patience and ability to exercise compassion. By recognizing that we cannot control the actions or emotions of others, we free ourselves to focus on our own responses, fostering greater empathy and compassion.</p>\n<p>Navigating uncertainty: In times of uncertainty or change, it can be tempting to cling to the illusion of control, finding comfort in the lie. However, by acknowledging the limits of our power, we can cultivate a sense of adaptability and resilience, allowing us to navigate the unknown with grace and equanimity.</p>\n<p>Cultivating emotional well-being: Embrace the knowledge that your emotional well-being lies within your control. When accept full responsibility for our wellbeing and cultivate positive thoughts and habits, we can create a more balanced and fulfilling emotional landscape.</p>\n<p>Embracing the dichotomy of control puts us on the path to greater serenity and self-mastery, guided by the wisdom of the Stoics and the enduring principles of Stoic philosophy.</p>\n<p>Page Break Image of a Greek Temple</p>\n<p>IV. CULTIVATING INNER RESILIENCE AND ADAPTABILITY\nResilience and adaptability serve as important ingredients in the recipe for personal growth. Resilience enables us to weather the storms of life with fortitude and grace without allowing them to overwhelm us, and adaptability helps us find new ways to do things more constructively.</p>\n<p>In this section, we’ll draw upon insights from the Meditations to find a path to inner strength and flexibility, and share techniques for building resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity.</p>\n<p>DEVELOPING INNER STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY\nThroughout the Meditations, Marcus Aurelius offers a wealth of insights into the cultivation of inner resilience. He teaches us to embrace the inevitability of change, recognizing that the ebb and flow of life’s circumstances offer valuable opportunities for growth and learning.</p>\n<p>When we develop an understanding of our own capacity for inner strength and accept that the nature of the world around us is to change, we become better equipped to navigate the flow of life, even when we don’t like what comes our way.</p>\n<p>Aurelius also highlights the importance of being flexible in our thoughts and actions, encouraging us to adapt our perspectives in response to changing conditions.</p>\n<p>This means cultivating an open and adaptable mindset. In doing so, we free ourselves from the constraints of rigid thinking and the suffering that comes from being unable to accept a change in our circumstances</p>\n<p>Cheerfulness. Without requiring other people’s help. Or serenity supplied by others.</p>\n<p>– Marcus Aurelius</p>\n<p>BUILDING RESILIENCE AND ADAPTABILITY IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY\nLooking into the writings of Marcus Aurelius, we can see that there are trends in how he perceives adversity. From these trends we can find the following lessons:</p>\n<p>Embrace change: Change is an inherent part of the human experience, and by embracing it rather than resisting it, we can develop a greater sense of adaptability. Recognize that every change, whether positive or negative, offers an opportunity for growth and learning.</p>\n<p>Practice self-reflection: As we have discussed in previous sections, self-reflection is a powerful tool for personal growth. By engaging in regular introspection, we can identify areas of strength and weakness, and develop strategies for cultivating greater resilience and flexibility.</p>\n<p>Cultivate gratitude: Gratitude is a potent antidote to adversity, as it helps us to focus on the positive aspects of our lives, even in the face of hardship. Make a conscious effort to practice gratitude on a daily basis, and witness the transformative effect it can have on your outlook and resilience.</p>\n<p>Seek out challenges: By actively seeking out challenges and embracing the discomfort they bring, we strengthen our capacity for resilience and adaptability. View each challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow, and you will find that your inner strength blossoms in response.</p>\n<p>Develop a growth mindset: A growth mindset, as opposed to a fixed mindset, involves viewing challenges and setbacks as opportunities for personal development. By adopting this perspective, we cultivate a greater sense of resilience and adaptability, as we view adversity as a catalyst for growth rather than a source of defeat.</p>\n<p>V. THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM AND VIRTUE\nThe Stoic principles of developing wisdom and living in alignment with virtue serve as guiding stars on our voyage towards self-mastery, fulfilment, and enlightenment.</p>\n<p>In this section, we’ll explore the importance of wisdom and virtue in Marcus Aurelius’ Stoic philosophy and have a close look at some practical steps needed to develop these qualities in our own lives.</p>\n<p>The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature.</p>\n<p>– Marcus Aurelius</p>\n<p>THE IMPORTANCE OF WISDOM AND VIRTUE\nIn the Meditations, Marcus Aurelius places a great deal of emphasis on the pursuit of wisdom and virtue as the ultimate goals of human life. Many of the Stoics viewed virtue as the only good and believed that to live a good and happy life, virtue must be at the top of the list of priorities.</p>\n<p>Aurelius seemed to believe that these qualities were the keys to unlocking not only happiness but also effectiveness as a ruler. Wisdom, in the Stoic sense, refers to the deep understanding of the natural order of the universe and our place within it, while virtue encompasses the ethical principles that guide our thoughts, words, and deeds (the four cardinal virtues being wisdom, justice, temperance, and courage)</p>\n<p>For Marcus Aurelius, the pursuit of wisdom and virtue is not a mere intellectual exercise but a lifelong endeavor that should permeate every aspect of our lives. When we adopt these things into our day-to-day existence, we align ourselves with the highest ideals of Stoic philosophy and get closer to what the Stoics called eudaimonia or flourishing.</p>\n<p>He wrote:</p>\n<p>Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.</p>\n<p>– Marcus Aurelius</p>\n<p>PRACTICAL STEPS FOR ADOPTING WISDOM AND VIRTUE\nSo, what practical steps can we take to help embody wisdom and virtue in our modern lives?</p>\n<p>Seek knowledge and understanding: Actively pursue opportunities for learning and growth, whether through reading, engaging in thoughtful conversations, or exploring new experiences. By broadening our intellectual horizons, we foster the development of wisdom and a deeper understanding of the world around us. When we do this and make an effort to be more objective we also develop the ability to see the world how it it, rather than project our judgements and biases onto it.</p>\n<p>Reflect on moral principles: Contemplate the ethical values that guide your life and consider how they align with the tenets of Stoic philosophy. By cultivating a strong moral compass, we pave the way for a life rooted in virtue and integrity.</p>\n<p>Practice empathy and compassion: Embodying virtue also involves cultivating a deep sense of empathy and compassion for others. Strive to understand the perspectives and emotions of those around you, and respond to their needs with kindness and understanding.</p>\n<p>Embrace self-discipline: Wisdom and virtue are not passive qualities; they require a commitment to self-discipline and perseverance. Cultivate habits that promote temperance, such as regular self-reflection, mindfulness, and the pursuit of meaningful goals.</p>\n<p>This is not an exhaustive list but it can go some way toward helping us follow in the footsteps of Marcus Aurelius and embrace the pursuit of wisdom and virtue as we embark on a path of personal growth and self-discovery.</p>\n<p>When you need encouragement, think of the qualities the people around you have: this one’s energy, that one’s modesty, another’s generosity, and so on. Nothing is as encouraging as when virtues are visibly embodied in the people around us, when we’re practically showered with them. It’s good to keep this in mind.</p>\n<p>– Marcus Aurelius</p>\n<p>Page Break Image of a Greek Temple</p>\n<p>VI. NURTURING COMPASSION AND EMPATHY\nAnother core of Aurelius’ philosophy is the fostering of compassion and empathy, the qualities that bind us together and nurture the bonds of human connection.</p>\n<p>In this section, we’ll have a look at how we can adopt some of Marcus Aurelius’ teachings on fostering compassion and empathy towards others and share strategies for enhancing our connections with those around us through the prism of Stoicism.</p>\n<p>COMPASSION AND EMPATHY TOWARDS OTHERS\nThroughout the Meditations, Marcus Aurelius demonstrates a capacity for compassion and empathy, emphasizing their importance in fostering a sense of connectedness and understanding with others.</p>\n<p>He encourages us to see beyond our own perspectives and to recognize the shared humanity that unites us all, urging us to embrace the role of “citizens of the world” and to act in the best interests of the collective.</p>\n<p>He reminds us that we are all on this journey of life together and that by extending our compassion and empathy to others, we contribute to the greater good and enrich our own lives in the process.</p>\n<p>He wrote:</p>\n<p>“Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil. But for my part I have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility, the nature of evil and its meanness, and also the nature of the culprit himself, who is my brother (not in the physical sense, but as a fellow creature similarly endowed with reason and a share of the divine); therefore none of those things can injure me, for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading. Neither can I be angry with my brother or fall foul of him; for he and I were born to work together, like a man’s two hands, feet or eyelids, or the upper and lower rows of his teeth. To obstruct each other is against Nature’s law – and what is irritation or aversion but a form of obstruction.”</p>\n<p>―Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</p>\n<p>STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCING OUR CONNECTIONS WITH OTHERS\nThe following strategies can help you nurture compassion and empathy in your daily life, enhancing your connections with others:</p>\n<p>Practice active listening: Engage fully in conversations, listening attentively to the thoughts and feelings of others without judgment or interruption.</p>\n<p>Cultivate self-awareness: By becoming more aware of our own emotions, we are better equipped to empathize with the emotions of others. Practice self-reflection and mindfulness to develop a deeper understanding of your emotional landscape, and use this knowledge to strengthen your empathy towards others.</p>\n<p>Seek to understand before being understood: In our interactions with others, strive to understand their perspectives, emotions, and experiences before attempting to communicate your own.</p>\n<p>Embrace vulnerability: By allowing ourselves to be vulnerable and open with others, we create an environment in which empathy and compassion can flourish. Share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences with others, and encourage them to do the same, fostering a sense of trust and shared humanity.</p>\n<p>Practice loving-kindness meditation: This form of meditation, rooted in Buddhist tradition, involves focusing on cultivating feelings of love and compassion towards oneself and others. By practicing loving-kindness meditation, you can enhance your capacity for empathy and compassion, enriching your connections with those around you.</p>\n<p>Page Break Image of a Greek Temple</p>\n<p>VII. ACCEPTING IMPERMANENCE AND CHANGE\nAs we continue to journey through the pages of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, we encounter the profound wisdom of embracing impermanence and change. These fundamental aspects of existence serve as the backdrop against which the drama of life unfolds, inviting us to relinquish our desire for control and surrender to the natural rhythms of the universe. In this section, we shall explore the role of impermanence and change in Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations and share techniques for finding peace amidst life’s uncertainties by embracing the impermanent nature of all things.</p>\n<p>“Loss is nothing else but change, and change is Nature’s delight.”</p>\n<p>– Marcus Aurelius</p>\n<p>THE ROLE OF IMPERMANENCE AND CHANGE\nIn his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius contemplates the ceaseless dance of change and impermanence, urging us to recognize and accept the transient nature of our existence. He teaches that our lives, like the seasons of the year, are in a constant state of flux, subject to the ebb and flow of fortune and circumstance. Through the acknowledgement of the inevitability of change, we liberate ourselves from the fruitless pursuit of permanence and awaken to the beauty and richness of life’s unfolding story.</p>\n<p>Aurelius also encourages us to view impermanence as a catalyst for growth and transformation, recognizing that change brings with it the opportunity for renewal, evolution, and the need for adaptability.</p>\n<p>When we understand that the nature of the universe is change and we embrace that nature, we bring ourselves closer to wisdom and become more resilient to the negative impact of changing circumstances.</p>\n<p>He wrote:</p>\n<p>“Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What’s closer to nature’s heart? Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take place without something being changed? Can’t you see? It’s just the same with you—and just as vital to nature.”</p>\n<p>―Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</p>\n<p>TECHNIQUES FOR EMBRACING IMPERMANENCE AND FINDING PEACE\nHere are a few pointers to help you develop this perspective on change in your own life:</p>\n<p>Practice mindfulness: Develop awareness of the present moment, recognizing that each experience, thought, and emotion is fleeting and will eventually give way to something new.</p>\n<p>Reflect on the transient nature of all things: Contemplate the impermanence of life and its manifestations, from the changing seasons to the cycles of birth and death. This reflection can help you develop a greater appreciation for the beauty and fragility of existence, fostering a sense of peace and acceptance.</p>\n<p>Cultivate non-attachment: Release your attachment to outcomes, possessions, and relationships, recognizing that all things are subject to change and impermanence. By embracing non-attachment, we free ourselves from the suffering that arises from clinging to the transient and allow ourselves to experience life with greater ease and grace.</p>\n<p>Focus on the process, not the outcome: In your endeavors, strive to appreciate and enjoy the journey, rather than becoming fixated on the end result. Through focusing on the process, you cultivate an attitude of openness and flexibility, allowing you to adapt and thrive in the face of change and uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Foster gratitude for the present moment: Practice gratitude for the present moment and all that it offers, recognizing that each experience is a unique and transient gift. Cultivating gratitude helps to anchor us in the present, allowing us to embrace the impermanence of life with a sense of appreciation and wonder.</p>\n<p>VIII. CONCLUSION OF MEDITATIONS\nHopefully some of the lessons above help explain the value that can be found in the Meditations. I highly recommend picking up a copy of the book for yourself and reading through it. Although I’ve tried to summarise the words as best I can, the source material is full of practical wisdom that can add lasting benefits to those who are looking for insight into Stoic philosophy.</p>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures. Simple in actions and in thoughts, you return to the source\nof being. Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are. Compassionate toward yourself, you reconcile all beings in the world.” ~ Lao Tzu from Tao te Ching</p>\n<p>“Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.” ~ Lao Tzu</p>\n<p>If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.</p>\n<p>This present moment is all the life we ever have.

No matter how many years stretch behind or in front of us, the present moment remains the same.” Marcus Aurelius</p>\n<p>Like a horse after running a race, or a bee after making honey, a good person doesn’t stop and look around for applause or rewards. They go on to produce another good deed, as a vine produces more grapes in season.” Marcus Aurelius</p>\n<p>Am I unhappy because of what happened to me?

And on freeing\nyourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can—if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions\noverride what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that’s all even the gods can ask of you.”</p>\n<p>“We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.”</p>\n<p>“Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren’t packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human—however imperfectly—and fully embrace the pursuit that you’ve embarked on.”</p>\n<p>“How easy it is to repel and to wipe away every impression which is troublesome or unsuitable, and immediately to be in all tranquility.”</p>\n<p>“You could leave life right now.

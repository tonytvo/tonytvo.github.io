Until recently redundancy of hardware components was sufficient for most applications. As data volumes increase, more applications use a larger number of machines, proportionally increasing the rate of hardware faults. <strong>There is a move towards systems that tolerate the loss of entire machines</strong>. A system that tolerates machine failure can be patched one node at a time, without downtime of the entire system (<em>rolling upgrade</em>).</li>\n<li><strong>Software errors</strong>. It is unlikely that a large number of hardware components will fail at the same time. Software errors are a systematic error within the system, they tend to cause many more system failures than uncorrelated hardware faults.</li>\n<li><strong>Human errors</strong>.

When a user requests their home timeline, look up all the people they follow, find all the tweets for those users, and merge them (sorted by time). This could be done with a SQL <code class=\"language-text\">JOIN</code>.</li>\n<li>Maintain a cache for each user’s home timeline. When a user <em>posts a tweet</em>, look up all the people who follow that user, and insert the new tweet into each of their home timeline caches.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Approach 1, systems struggle to keep up with the load of home timeline queries. So the company switched to approach 2. The average rate of published tweets is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the rate of home timeline reads.</p>\n<p>Downside of approach 2 is that posting a tweet now requires a lot of extra work. Some users have over 30 million followers. A single tweet may result in over 30 million writes to home timelines.</p>\n<p>Twitter moved to an hybrid of both approaches. Tweets continue to be fanned out to home timelines but a small number of users with a very large number of followers are fetched separately and merged with that user’s home timeline when it is read, like in approach 1.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"describing-performance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#describing-performance\" aria-label=\"describing performance permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Describing performance</h4>\n<p>What happens when the load increases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How is the performance affected?</li>\n<li>How much do you need to increase your resources?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a batch processing system such as Hadoop, we usually care about <em>throughput</em>, or the number of records we can process per second.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"latency-and-response-time\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#latency-and-response-time\" aria-label=\"latency and response time permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Latency and response time</h5>\n<p>The response time is what the client sees.

The simplest indexing strategy is to keep an in-memory hash map where every key is mapped to a byte offset in the data file. Whenever you append a new key-value pair to the file, you also update the hash map to reflect the offset of the data you just wrote.</p>\n<p>Bitcask (the default storage engine in Riak) does it like that. The only requirement it has is that all the keys fit in the available RAM. Values can use more space than there is available in memory, since they can be loaded from disk.</p>\n<p>A storage engine like Bitcask is well suited to situations where the value for each key is updated frequently. There are a lot of writes, but there are too many distinct keys, you have a large number of writes per key, but it’s feasible to keep all keys in memory.</p>\n<p>As we only ever append to a file, so how do we avoid eventually running out of disk space? <strong>A good solution is to break the log into segments of certain size by closing the segment file when it reaches a certain size, and making subsequent writes to a new segment file. We can then perform <em>compaction</em> on these segments.</strong> Compaction means throwing away duplicate keys in the log, and keeping only the most recent update for each key.</p>\n<p>We can also merge several segments together at the sae time as performing the compaction. Segments are never modified after they have been written, so the merged segment is written to a new file. Merging and compaction of frozen segments can be done in a background thread. After the merging process is complete, we switch read requests to use the new merged segment instead of the old segments, and the old segment files can simply be deleted.</p>\n<p>Each segment now has its own in-memory hash table, mapping keys to file offsets. In order to find a value for a key, we first check the most recent segment hash map; if the key is not present we check the second-most recent segment and so on. The merging process keeps the number of segments small, so lookups don’t need to check many hash maps.</p>\n<p>Some issues that are important in a real implementation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File format. It is simpler to use binary format.</li>\n<li>Deleting records. Append special deletion record to the data file (<em>tombstone</em>) that tells the merging process to discard previous values.</li>\n<li>Crash recovery. If restarted, the in-memory hash maps are lost. You can recover from reading each segment but that would take long time. Bitcask speeds up recovery by storing a snapshot of each segment hash map on disk.</li>\n<li>Partially written records. The database may crash at any time. Bitcask includes checksums allowing corrupted parts of the log to be detected and ignored.</li>\n<li>Concurrency control. As writes are appended to the log in a strictly sequential order, a common implementation is to have a single writer thread. Segments are immutable, so they can be read concurrently by multiple threads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Append-only design turns out to be good for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appending and segment merging are sequential write operations, much faster than random writes, especially on magnetic spinning-disks.</li>\n<li>Concurrency and crash recovery are much simpler.</li>\n<li>Merging old segments avoids files getting fragmented over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hash table has its limitations too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The hash table must fit in memory. It is difficult to make an on-disk hash map perform well.</li>\n<li>Range queries are not efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"sstables-and-lsm-trees\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sstables-and-lsm-trees\" aria-label=\"sstables and lsm trees permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>SSTables and LSM-Trees</h4>\n<p>We introduce a new requirement to segment files: we require that the sequence of key-value pairs is <em>sorted by key</em>.</p>\n<p>We call this <em>Sorted String Table</em>, or <em>SSTable</em>. We require that each key only appears once within each merged segment file (compaction already ensures that). SSTables have few big advantages over log segments with hash indexes</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Merging segments is simple and efficient</strong> (we can use algorithms like <em>mergesort</em>). When multiple segments contain the same key, we can keep the value from the most recent segment and discard the values in older segments.</li>\n<li><strong>You no longer need to keep an index of all the keys in memory.</strong> For a key like <code class=\"language-text\">handiwork</code>, when you know the offsets for the keys <code class=\"language-text\">handback</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">handsome</code>, you know <code class=\"language-text\">handiwork</code> must appear between those two. You can jump to the offset for <code class=\"language-text\">handback</code> and scan from there until you find <code class=\"language-text\">handiwork</code>, if not, the key is not present. You still need an in-memory index to tell you the offsets for some of the keys. One key for every few kilobytes of segment file is sufficient.</li>\n<li>Since read requests need to scan over several key-value pairs in the requested range anyway, <strong>it is possible to group those records into a block and compress it</strong> before writing it to disk.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How do we get the data sorted in the first place? With red-black trees or AVL trees, you can insert keys in any order and read them back in sorted order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a write comes in, add it to an in-memory balanced tree structure (<em>memtable</em>).</li>\n<li>When the memtable gets bigger than some threshold (megabytes), write it out to disk as an SSTable file. Writes can continue to a new memtable instance.</li>\n<li>On a read request, try to find the key in the memtable, then in the most recent on-disk segment, then in the next-older segment, etc.</li>\n<li>From time to time, run merging and compaction in the background to discard overwritten and deleted values.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the database crashes, the most recent writes are lost. We can keep a separate log on disk to which every write is immediately appended. That log is not in sorted order, but that doesn’t matter, because its only purpose is to restore the memtable after crash. Every time the memtable is written out to an SSTable, the log can be discarded.</p>\n<p><strong>Storage engines that are based on this principle of merging and compacting sorted files are often called LSM structure engines (Log Structure Merge-Tree).</strong></p>\n<p>Lucene, an indexing engine for full-text search used by Elasticsearch and Solr, uses a similar method for storing its <em>term dictionary</em>.</p>\n<p>LSM-tree algorithm can be slow when looking up keys that don’t exist in the database. To optimise this, storage engines often use additional <em>Bloom filters</em> (a memory-efficient data structure for approximating the contents of a set).</p>\n<p>There are also different strategies to determine the order and timing of how SSTables are compacted and merged. Mainly two <em>size-tiered</em> and <em>leveled</em> compaction. LevelDB and RocksDB use leveled compaction, HBase use size-tiered, and Cassandra supports both. In size-tiered compaction, newer and smaller SSTables are successively merged into older and larger SSTables. In leveled compaction, the key range is split up into smaller SSTables and older data is moved into separate “levels”, which allows the compaction to use less disk space.</p>\n<h4 id=\"b-trees\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#b-trees\" aria-label=\"b trees permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>B-trees</h4>\n<p>This is the most widely used indexing structure. B-tress keep key-value pairs sorted by key, which allows efficient key-value lookups and range queries.</p>\n<p>The log-structured indexes break the database down into variable-size <em>segments</em> typically several megabytes or more. B-trees break the database down into fixed-size <em>blocks</em> or <em>pages</em>, traditionally 4KB.</p>\n<p>One page is designated as the <em>root</em> and you start from there. The page contains several keys and references to child pages.</p>\n<p>If you want to update the value for an existing key in a B-tree, you search for the leaf page containing that key, change the value in that page, and write the page back to disk. If you want to add new key, find the page and add it to the page. If there isn’t enough free space in the page to accommodate the new key, it is split in two half-full pages, and the parent page is updated to account for the new subdivision of key ranges.</p>\n<p>Trees remain <em>balanced</em>. A B-tree with <em>n</em> keys always has a depth of <em>O</em>(log <em>n</em>).</p>\n<p>The basic underlying write operation of a B-tree is to overwrite a page on disk with new data. It is assumed that the overwrite does not change the location of the page, all references to that page remain intact. This is a big contrast to log-structured indexes such as LSM-trees, which only append to files.</p>\n<p>Some operations require several different pages to be overwritten. When you split a page, you need to write the two pages that were split, and also overwrite their parent. If the database crashes after only some of the pages have been written, you end up with a corrupted index.</p>\n<p>It is common to include an additional data structure on disk: a <em>write-ahead log</em> (WAL, also know as the <em>redo log</em>).</p>\n<p>Careful concurrency control is required if multiple threads are going to access, typically done protecting the tree internal data structures with <em>latches</em> (lightweight locks).</p>\n<h4 id=\"b-trees-and-lsm-trees\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#b-trees-and-lsm-trees\" aria-label=\"b trees and lsm trees permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>B-trees and LSM-trees</h4>\n<p>LSM-trees are typically faster for writes, whereas B-trees are thought to be faster for reads. Reads are typically slower on LSM-tress as they have to check several different data structures and SSTables at different stages of compaction.</p>\n<p>Advantages of LSM-trees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LSM-trees are typically able to sustain higher write throughput than B-trees, party because they sometimes have lower write amplification: a write to the database results in multiple writes to disk. The more a storage engine writes to disk, the fewer writes per second it can handle.</li>\n<li>LSM-trees can be compressed better, and thus often produce smaller files on disk than B-trees. B-trees tend to leave disk space unused due to fragmentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Downsides of LSM-trees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compaction process can sometimes interfere with the performance of ongoing reads and writes. B-trees can be more predictable. The bigger the database, the the more disk bandwidth is required for compaction. Compaction cannot keep up with the rate of incoming writes, if not configured properly you can run out of disk space.</li>\n<li>On B-trees, each key exists in exactly one place in the index. This offers strong transactional semantics. Transaction isolation is implemented using locks on ranges of keys, and in a B-tree index, those locks can be directly attached to the tree.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"other-indexing-structures\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#other-indexing-structures\" aria-label=\"other indexing structures permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Other indexing structures</h4>\n<p>We’ve only discussed key-value indexes, which are like <em>primary key</em> index.

This can take a long time.</p>\n<p><em>Column-oriented storage</em> is simple: don’t store all the values from one row together, but store all values from each <em>column</em> together instead. If each column is stored in a separate file, a query only needs to read and parse those columns that are used in a query, which can save a lot of work.</p>\n<p>Column-oriented storage often lends itself very well to compression as the sequences of values for each column look quite repetitive, which is a good sign for compression. A technique that is particularly effective in data warehouses is <em>bitmap encoding</em>.</p>\n<p>Bitmap indexes are well suited for all kinds of queries that are common in a data warehouse.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cassandra and HBase have a concept of <em>column families</em>, which they inherited from Bigtable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Besides reducing the volume of data that needs to be loaded from disk, column-oriented storage layouts are also good for making efficient use of CPU cycles (<em>vectorised processing</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Column-oriented storage, compression, and sorting helps to make read queries faster and make sense in data warehouses, where most of the load consist on large read-only queries run by analysts. The downside is that writes are more difficult.</strong></p>\n<p>An update-in-place approach, like B-tree use, is not possible with compressed columns. If you insert a row in the middle of a sorted table, you would most likely have to rewrite all column files.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning <em>materialised aggregates</em> as some cache of the counts ant the sums that queries use most often. A way of creating such a cache is with a <em>materialised view</em>, on a relational model this is usually called a <em>virtual view</em>: a table-like object whose contents are the results of some query. A materialised view is an actual copy of the query results, written in disk, whereas a virtual view is just a shortcut for writing queries.</p>\n<p>When the underlying data changes, a materialised view needs to be updated, because it is denormalised copy of the data. Database can do it automatically, but writes would become more expensive.</p>\n<p>A common special case of a materialised view is know as a <em>data cube</em> or <em>OLAP cube</em>, a grid of aggregates grouped by different dimensions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"encoding-and-evolution\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#encoding-and-evolution\" aria-label=\"encoding and evolution permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Encoding and evolution</h2>\n<p>Change to an application’s features also requires a change to data it stores.</p>\n<p>Relational databases conforms to one schema although that schema can be changed, there is one schema in force at any point in time. <strong>Schema-on-read (or schemaless) contain a mixture of older and newer data formats.</strong></p>\n<p>In large applications changes don’t happen instantaneously.

There are binary encodings for JSON (MesagePack, BSON, BJSON, UBJSON, BISON and Smile), similar thing for XML (WBXML and Fast Infoset).</p>\n<p><strong>Apache Thrift and Protocol Buffers (protobuf) are binary encoding libraries.</strong></p>\n<p>Thrift offers two different protocols:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BinaryProtocol</strong>, there are no field names like <code class=\"language-text\">userName</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">favouriteNumber</code>. Instead the data contains <em>field tags</em>, which are numbers (<code class=\"language-text\">1</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">2</code>)</li>\n<li><strong>CompactProtocol</strong>, which is equivalent to BinaryProtocol but it packs the same information in less space. It packs the field type and the tag number into the same byte.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Protocol Buffers are very similar to Thrift’s CompactProtocol, bit packing is a bit different and that might allow smaller compression.</p>\n<p>Schemas inevitable need to change over time (<em>schema evolution</em>), how do Thrift and Protocol Buffers handle schema changes while keeping backward and forward compatibility changes?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forward compatible support</strong>. As with new fields you add new tag numbers, old code trying to read new code, it can simply ignore not recognised tags.</li>\n<li><strong>Backwards compatible support</strong>. As long as each field has a unique tag number, new code can always read old data. Every field you add after initial deployment of schema must be optional or have a default value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Removing fields is just like adding a field with backward and forward concerns reversed. You can only remove a field that is optional, and you can never use the same tag again.</p>\n<p>What about changing the data type of a field?

Any mismatch in the schema between the reader and the writer would mean incorrectly decoded data.</p>\n<p>What about schema evolution? When an application wants to encode some data, it encodes the data using whatever version of the schema it knows (<em>writer’s schema</em>).</p>\n<p>When an application wants to decode some data, it is expecting the data to be in some schema (<em>reader’s schema</em>).</p>\n<p>In Avro the writer’s schema and the reader’s schema <em>don’t have to be the same</em>. The Avro library resolves the differences by looking at the writer’s schema and the reader’s schema.</p>\n<p>Forward compatibility means you can have a new version of the schema as writer and an old version of the schema as reader. Conversely, backward compatibility means that you can have a new version of the schema as reader and an old version as writer.</p>\n<p>To maintain compatibility, you may only add or remove a field that has a default value.</p>\n<p>If you were to add a field that has no default value, new readers wouldn’t be able to read data written by old writers.</p>\n<p>Changing the datatype of a field is possible, provided that Avro can convert the type. Changing the name of a filed is tricky (backward compatible but not forward compatible).</p>\n<p>The schema is identified encoded in the data. In a large file with lots of records, the writer of the file can just include the schema at the beginning of the file. On a database with individually written records, you cannot assume all the records will have the same schema, so you have to include a version number at the beginning of every encoded record. While sending records over the network, you can negotiate the schema version on connection setup.</p>\n<p>Avro is friendlier to <em>dynamically generated schemas</em> (dumping into a file the database). You can fairly easily generate an Avro schema in JSON.</p>\n<p>If the database schema changes, you can just generate a new Avro schema for the updated database schema and export data in the new Avro schema.</p>\n<p>By contrast with Thrift and Protocol Buffers, every time the database schema changes, you would have to manually update the mappings from database column names to field tags.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Although textual formats such as JSON, XML and CSV are widespread, binary encodings based on schemas are also a viable option. As they have nice properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can be much more compact, since they can omit field names from the encoded data.</li>\n<li>Schema is a valuable form of documentation, required for decoding, you can be sure it is up to date.</li>\n<li>Database of schemas allows you to check forward and backward compatibility changes.</li>\n<li>Generate code from the schema is useful, since it enables type checking at compile time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"modes-of-dataflow\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#modes-of-dataflow\" aria-label=\"modes of dataflow permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Modes of dataflow</h3>\n<p>Different process on how data flows between processes</p>\n<h4 id=\"via-databases\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#via-databases\" aria-label=\"via databases permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Via databases</h4>\n<p>The process that writes to the database encodes the data, and the process that reads from the database decodes it.</p>\n<p>A value in the database may be written by a <em>newer</em> version of the code, and subsequently read by an <em>older</em> version of the code that is still running.</p>\n<p>When a new version of your application is deployed, you may entirely replace the old version with the new version within a few minutes.

The message goes via an intermediary called a <em>message broker</em> (<em>message queue</em> or <em>message-oriented middleware</em>) which stores the message temporarily. This has several advantages compared to direct RPC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can act as a buffer if the recipient is unavailable or overloaded</li>\n<li>It can automatically redeliver messages to a process that has crashed and prevent messages from being lost</li>\n<li>It avoids the sender needing to know the IP address and port number of the recipient (useful in a cloud environment)</li>\n<li>It allows one message to be sent to several recipients</li>\n<li><strong>Decouples the sender from the recipient</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The communication happens only in one direction. The sender doesn’t wait for the message to be delivered, but simply sends it and then forgets about it (<em>asynchronous</em>).</p>\n<p>Open source implementations for message brokers are RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, HornetQ, NATS, and Apache Kafka.</p>\n<p>One process sends a message to a named <em>queue</em> or <em>topic</em> and the broker ensures that the message is delivered to one or more <em>consumers</em> or <em>subscribers</em> to that queue or topic.</p>\n<p>Message brokers typically don’t enforce a particular data model, you can use any encoding format.</p>\n<p>An <em>actor model</em> is a programming model for concurrency in a single process. Rather than dealing with threads (and their complications), logic is encapsulated in <em>actors</em>. Each actor typically represent one client or entity, it may have some local state, and it communicates with other actors by sending and receiving asynchronous messages. Message deliver is not guaranteed.

MySQL uses <em>circular topology</em>, where each nodes receives writes from one node and forwards those writes to another node. Another popular topology has the shape of a <em>star</em>, one designated node forwards writes to all of the other nodes.</p>\n<p>In circular and star topologies a write might need to pass through multiple nodes before they reach all replicas. To prevent infinite replication loops each node is given a unique identifier and the replication log tags each write with the identifiers of the nodes it has passed through. When a node fails it can interrupt the flow of replication messages.</p>\n<p>In all-to-all topology fault tolerance is better as messages can travel along different paths avoiding a single point of failure. It has some issues too, some network links may be faster than others and some replication messages may “overtake” others. To order events correctly. there is a technique called <em>version vectors</em>. PostgresSQL BDR does not provide casual ordering of writes, and Tungsten Replicator for MySQL doesn’t even try to detect conflicts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leaderless-replication\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#leaderless-replication\" aria-label=\"leaderless replication permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Leaderless replication</h3>\n<p>Simply put, any replica can directly accept writes from clients.

If a node is added to the cluster, we can <em>steal</em> a few partitions from every existing node until partitions are fairly distributed once again. The number of partitions does not change, nor does the assignment of keys to partitions. The only thing that change is the assignment of partitions to nodes. This is used in Riak, Elasticsearch, Couchbase, and Voldemport. <strong>You need to choose a high enough number of partitions to accomodate future growth.</strong> Neither too big or too small.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic partitioning.</strong> The number of partitions adapts to the total data volume. An empty database starts with an empty partition. While the dataset is small, all writes have to processed by a single node while the others nodes sit idle. HBase and MongoDB allow an initial set of partitions to be configured (<em>pre-splitting</em>).</li>\n<li><strong>Partitioning proportionally to nodes.</strong> Cassandra and Ketama make the number of partitions proportional to the number of nodes.

The idea of consistency depends on the application’s notion of invariants. Atomicity, isolation, and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency (in an ACID sense) is a property of the application.</li>\n<li><strong>Isolation.</strong> Concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other. It’s also called <em>serializability</em>, each transaction can pretend that it is the only transaction running on the entire database, and the result is the same as if they had run <em>serially</em> (one after the other).</li>\n<li><strong>Durability.</strong> Once a transaction has committed successfully, any data it has written will not be forgotten, even if there is a hardware fault or the database crashes. In a single-node database this means the data has been written to nonvolatile storage. In a replicated database it means the data has been successfully copied to some number of nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Atomicity can be implemented using a log for crash recovery, and isolation can be implemented using a lock on each object, allowing only one thread to access an object at any one time.</p>\n<p><strong>A transaction is a mechanism for grouping multiple operations on multiple objects into one unit of execution.</strong></p>\n<h4 id=\"handling-errors-and-aborts\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#handling-errors-and-aborts\" aria-label=\"handling errors and aborts permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Handling errors and aborts</h4>\n<p>A key feature of a transaction is that it can be aborted and safely retried if an error occurred.</p>\n<p>In datastores with leaderless replication is the application’s responsibility to recover from errors.</p>\n<p>The whole point of aborts is to enable safe retries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"weak-isolation-levels\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#weak-isolation-levels\" aria-label=\"weak isolation levels permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Weak isolation levels</h3>\n<p>Concurrency issues (race conditions) come into play when one transaction reads data that is concurrently modified by another transaction, or when two transactions try to simultaneously modify the same data.</p>\n<p>Databases have long tried to hide concurrency issues by providing <em>transaction isolation</em>.</p>\n<p>In practice, is not that simple.

On top of snapshot isolation, SSI adds an algorithm for detecting serialization conflicts among writes and determining which transactions to abort.</p>\n<p>The database knows which transactions may have acted on an outdated premise and need to be aborted by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Detecting reads of a stale MVCC object version.</strong> The database needs to track when a transaction ignores another transaction’s writes due to MVCC visibility rules. When a transaction wants to commit, the database checks whether any of the ignored writes have now been committed.

Causality defines <em>a partial order</em>, not a total one (incomparable if they are concurrent).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Linearizability is not the only way of preserving causality. <strong>Causal consistency is the strongest possible consistency model that does not slow down due to network delays, and remains available in the face of network failures.</strong></p>\n<p>You need to know which operation <em>happened before</em>.</p>\n<p>In order to determine the causal ordering, the database needs to know which version of the data was read by the application. <strong>The version number from the prior operation is passed back to the database on a write.</strong></p>\n<p>We can create sequence numbers in a total order that is <em>consistent with causality</em>.</p>\n<p>With a single-leader replication, the leader can simply increment a counter for each operation, and thus assign a monotonically increasing sequence number to each operation in the replication log.</p>\n<p>If there is not a single leader (multi-leader or leaderless database):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each node can generate its own independent set of sequence numbers. One node can generate only odd numbers and the other only even numbers.</li>\n<li>Attach a timestamp from a time-of-day clock.</li>\n<li>Preallocate blocks of sequence numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only problem is that the sequence numbers they generate are <em>not consistent with causality</em>. They do not correctly capture ordering of operations across different nodes.</p>\n<p>There is simple method for generating sequence numbers that <em>is</em> consistent with causality: <em>Lamport timestamps</em>.</p>\n<p>Each node has a unique identifier, and each node keeps a counter of the number of operations it has processed. The lamport timestamp is then simply a pair of (<em>counter</em>, <em>node ID</em>). It provides total order, as if you have two timestamps one with a greater counter value is the greater timestamp. If the counter values are the same, the one with greater node ID is the greater timestamp.</p>\n<p>Every node and every client keeps track of the <em>maximum</em> counter value it has seen so far, and includes that maximum on every request. When a node receives a request of response with a maximum counter value greater than its own counter value, it inmediately increases its own counter to that maximum.</p>\n<p>As long as the maximum counter value is carried along with every operation, this scheme  ensure that the ordering from the lamport timestamp is consistent with causality.</p>\n<p>Total order of oepration only emerges after you have collected all of the operations.</p>\n<p>Total order broadcast:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reliable delivery: If a message is delivered to one node, it is delivered to all nodes.</li>\n<li>Totally ordered delivery: Mesages are delivered to every node in the same order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ZooKeeper and etcd implement total order broadcast.</p>\n<p>If every message represents a write to the database, and every replica processes the same writes in the same order, then the replcias will remain consistent with each other (<em>state machine replication</em>).</p>\n<p>A node is not allowed to retroactgively insert a message into an earlier position in the order if subsequent messages have already been dlivered.</p>\n<p>Another way of looking at total order broadcast is that it is a way of creating a <em>log</em>. Delivering a message is like appending to the log.</p>\n<p>If you have total order broadcast, you can build linearizable storage on top of it.</p>\n<p>Because log entries are delivered to all nodes in the same order, if therer are several concurrent writes, all nodes will agree on which one came first. Choosing the first of the conflicting writes as the winner and aborting later ones ensures that all nodes agree on whether a write was commited or aborted.</p>\n<p>This procedure ensures linearizable writes, it doesn’t guarantee linearizable reads.</p>\n<p>To make reads linearizable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can sequence reads through the log by appending a message, reading the log, and performing the actual read when the message is delivered back to you (etcd works something like this).</li>\n<li>Fetch the position of the latest log message in a linearizable way, you can query that position to be delivered to you, and then perform the read (idea behind ZooKeeper’s <code class=\"language-text\">sync()</code>).</li>\n<li>You can make your read from a replica that is synchronously updated on writes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For every message you want to send through total order broadcast, you increment-and-get the linearizable integer and then attach the value you got from the register as a sequence number to the message. YOu can send the message to all nodes, and the recipients will deliver the message consecutively by sequence number.</p>\n<h3 id=\"distributed-transactions-and-consensus\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#distributed-transactions-and-consensus\" aria-label=\"distributed transactions and consensus permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Distributed transactions and consensus</h3>\n<p>Basically <em>getting several nodes to agree on something</em>.</p>\n<p>There are situations in which it is important for nodes to agree:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leader election: All nodes need to agree on which node is the leader.</li>\n<li>Atomic commit: Get all nodes to agree on the outcome of the transacction, either they all abort or roll back.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"atomic-commit-and-two-phase-commit-2pc\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#atomic-commit-and-two-phase-commit-2pc\" aria-label=\"atomic commit and two phase commit 2pc permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Atomic commit and two-phase commit (2PC)</h4>\n<p>A transaction either succesfully <em>commit</em>, or <em>abort</em>.

Within each epoch, the leader is unique.</p>\n<p>Every time the current leader is thought to be dead, a vote is started among the nodes to elect a new leader. This election is given an incremented epoch number, and thus epoch numbers are totallly ordered and monotonically increasing. If there is a conflic, the leader with the higher epoch number prevails.</p>\n<p>A node cannot trust its own judgement. It must collect votes from a <em>quorum</em> of nodes. For every decision that a leader wants to make, it must send the proposed value to the other nodes and wait for a quorum of nodes to respond in favor of the proposal.</p>\n<p>There are two rounds of voting, once to choose a leader, and second time to vote on a leader’s proposal. The quorums for those two votes must overlap.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference with 2PC, is that 2PC requires a “yes” vote for <em>every</em> participant.</p>\n<p>The benefits of consensus come at a cost.

In geographically distributed systems, it often happens that a node falsely believes the leader to have failed due to a network issue.

Data is replicated across all the nodes using a fault-tolerant total order broadcast algorithm.</p>\n<p>ZooKeeper is modeled after Google’s Chubby lock service and it provides some useful features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linearizable atomic operations: Usuing an atomic compare-and-set operation, you can implement a lock.</li>\n<li>Total ordering of operations: When some resource is protected by a lock or lease, you need a <em>fencing token</em> to prevent clients from conflicting with each other in the case of a process pause. The fencing token is some number that monotonically increases every time the lock is acquired.</li>\n<li>Failure detection: Clients maintain a long-lived session on ZooKeeper servers. When a ZooKeeper node fails, the session remains active. When ZooKeeper declares the session to be dead all locks held are automatically released.</li>\n<li>Change notifications: Not only can one client read locks and values, it can also watch them for changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ZooKeeper is super useful for distributed coordination.</p>\n<p>ZooKeeper/Chubby model works well when you have several instances of a process or service, and one of them needs to be chosen as a leader or primary. If the leader fails, one of the other nodes should take over. This is useful for single-leader databases and for job schedulers and similar stateful systems.</p>\n<p>ZooKeeper runs on a fixed number of nodes, and performs its majority votes among those nodes while supporting a potentially large number of clients.</p>\n<p>The kind of data managed by ZooKeeper is quite slow-changing like “the node running on 10.1.1.23 is the leader for partition 7”. It is not intended for storing the runtime state of the application. If application state needs to be replicated there are other tools (like Apache BookKeeper).</p>\n<p>ZooKeeper, etcd, and Consul are also often used for <em>service discovery</em>, find out which IP address you need to connect to in order to reach a particular service. In cloud environments, it is common for virtual machines to continually come an go, you often don’t know the IP addresses of your services ahead of time. Your services when they start up they register their network endpoints ina  service registry, where they can then be found by other services.</p>\n<p>ZooKeeper and friends can be seen as part of a long history of research into <em>membership services</em>, determining which nodes are currently active and live members of a cluster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"batch-processing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#batch-processing\" aria-label=\"batch processing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Batch processing</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Service (online): waits for a request, sends a response back</li>\n<li>Batch processing system (offline): takes a large amount of input data, runs a <em>job</em> to process it, and produces some output.</li>\n<li>Stream processing systems (near-real-time): a stream processor consumes input and produces outputs.

Sorting is performed in stages.</p>\n<p>Whenever a mapper finishes reading its input file and writing its sorted output files, the MapReduce scheduler notifies the reducers that they can start fetching the output files from that mapper. The reducers connect to each of the mappers and download the files of sorted key-value pairs for their partition. Partitioning by reducer, sorting and copying data partitions from mappers to reducers is called <em>shuffle</em>.</p>\n<p>The reduce task takes the files from the mappers and merges them together, preserving the sort order.</p>\n<p>MapReduce jobs can be chained together into <em>workflows</em>, the output of one job becomes the input to the next job. In Hadoop this chaining is done implicitly by directory name: the first job writes its output to a designated directory in HDFS, the second job reads that same directory name as its input.</p>\n<p>Compared with the Unix example, it could be seen as in each sequence of commands each command output is written to a temporary file, and the next command reads from the temporary file.</p>\n<p>It is common in datasets for one record to have an association with another record: a <em>foreign key</em> in a relational model, a <em>document reference</em> in a document model, or an <em>edge</em> in graph model.</p>\n<p>If the query involves joins, it may require multiple index lookpus. MapReduce has no concept of indexes.</p>\n<p>When a MapReduce job is given a set of files as input, it reads the entire content of all of those files, like a <em>full table scan</em>.</p>\n<p>In analytics it is common to want to calculate aggregates over a large number of records. Scanning the entire input might be quite reasonable.</p>\n<p>In order to achieve good throughput in a batch process, the computation must be local to one machine. Requests over the network are too slow and nondeterministic. Queries to other database for example would be prohibitive.</p>\n<p>A better approach is to take a copy of the data (peg: the database) and put it in the same distributed filesystem.</p>\n<p>MapReduce programming model has separated the physical network communication aspects of the computation (getting the data to the right machine) from the application logic (processing the data once you have it).</p>\n<p>In an example of a social network, small number of celebrities may have many millions of followers. Such disproportionately active database records are known as <em>linchpin objects</em> or <em>hot keys</em>.</p>\n<p>A single reducer can lead to significant <em>skew</em> that is, one reducer that must process significantly more records than the others.</p>\n<p>The <em>skewed join</em> method in Pig first runs a sampling job to determine which keys are hot and then records related to the hot key need to be replicated to <em>all</em> reducers handling that key.</p>\n<p>Handling the hot key over several reducers is called <em>shared join</em> method. In Crunch is similar but requires the hot keys to be specified explicitly.</p>\n<p>Hive’s skewed join optimisation requries hot keys to be specified explicitly and it uses map-side join. If you <em>can</em> make certain assumptions about your input data, it is possible to make joins faster. A MapReducer job with no reducers and no sorting, each mapper simply reads one input file and writes one output file.</p>\n<p>The output of a batch process is often not a report, but some other kind of structure.</p>\n<p>Google’s original use of MapReduce was to build indexes for its search engine. Hadoop MapReduce remains a good way of building indexes for Lucene/Solr.</p>\n<p>If you need to perform a full-text search, a batch process is very effective way of building indexes: the mappers partition the set of documents as needed, each reducer builds the index for its partition, and the index files are written to the distributed filesystem. It pararellises very well.</p>\n<p>Machine learning systems such as clasifiers and recommendation systems are a common use for batch processing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"key-value-stores-as-batch-process-output\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#key-value-stores-as-batch-process-output\" aria-label=\"key value stores as batch process output permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Key-value stores as batch process output</h4>\n<p>The output of those batch jobs is often some kind of database.</p>\n<p>So, how does the output from the batch process get back into a database?</p>\n<p>Writing from the batch job directly to the database server is a bad idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making a network request for every single record is magnitude slower than the normal throughput of a batch task.</li>\n<li>Mappers or reducers concurrently write to the same output database an it can be easily overwhelmed.</li>\n<li>You have to worry about the results from partially completed jobs being visible to other systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A much better solution is to build a brand-new database <em>inside</em> the batch job an write it as files to the job’s output directory, so it can be loaded in bulk into servers that handle read-only queries.

The sections we’ve seen had been already implemented in so-called <em>massively parallel processing</em> (MPP) databases.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference is that MPP databases focus on parallel execution of analytic SQL queries on a cluster of machines, while the combination of MapReduce and a distributed filesystem provides something much more like a general-purpose operating system that can run arbitraty programs.</p>\n<p>Hadoop opened up the possibility of indiscriminately dumpint data into HDFS. MPP databases typically require careful upfront modeling of the data and query patterns before importing data into the database’s proprietary storage format.</p>\n<p>In MapReduce instead of forcing the producer of a dataset to bring it into a standarised format, the interpretation of the data becomes the consumer’s problem.</p>\n<p>If you have HDFS and MapReduce, you <em>can</em> build a SQL query execution engine on top of it, and indeed this is what the Hive project did.</p>\n<p>If a node crashes while a query is executing, most MPP databases abort the entire query. MPP databases also prefer to keep as much data as possible in memory.</p>\n<p>MapReduce can tolerate the failure of a map or reduce task without it affecting the job.

It’s very robust, you can use it to process almost arbitrarily large quantities of data on an unreliable multi-tenant system with frequent task terminations, and it will still get the job done.</p>\n<p>The files on the distributed filesystem are simply <em>intermediate state</em>: a means of passing data from one job to the next.</p>\n<p>The process of writing out the intermediate state to files is called <em>materialisation</em>.</p>\n<p>MapReduce’s approach of fully materialising state has some downsides compared to Unix pipes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A MapReduce job can only start when all tasks in the preceding jobs have completed, whereas rocesses connected by a Unix pipe are started at the same time.</li>\n<li>Mappers are often redundant: they just read back the same file that was just written by a reducer.</li>\n<li>Files are replicated across several nodes, which is often overkill for such temporary data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To fix these problems with MapReduce, new execution engines for distributed batch computations were developed, Spark, Tez and Flink. These new ones can handle an entire workflow as one job, rather than breaking it up into independent subjobs (<em>dataflow engines</em>).</p>\n<p>These functions need not to take the strict roles of alternating map and reduce, they are assembled in flexible ways, in functions called <em>operators</em>.</p>\n<p>Spark, Flink, and Tex avoid writing intermediate state to HDFS, so they take a different approach to tolerating faults: if a machine fails and the intermediate state on that machine is lost, it is recomputed from other data that is still available.</p>\n<p>The framework must keep track of how a given piece of data was computed. Spark uses the resilient distributed dataset (RDD) to track ancestry data, while Flink checkpoints operator state, allowing it to resume running an operator that ran into a fault during its execution.</p>\n<h4 id=\"graphs-and-iterative-processing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#graphs-and-iterative-processing\" aria-label=\"graphs and iterative processing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Graphs and iterative processing</h4>\n<p>It’s interesting to look at graphs in batch processing context, where the goal is to perform some kind of offline processing or analysis on an entire graph.

It runs as a server, with producers and consumers connecting to it as clients. Producers write messages to the broker, and consumers receive them by reading them from the broker.</p>\n<p>By centralising the data, these systems can easily tolerate clients that come and go, and the question of durability is moved to the broker instead. Some brokers only keep messages in memory, while others write them down to disk so that they are not lost inc ase of a broker crash.</p>\n<p>A consequence of queueing is that consuemrs are generally <em>asynchronous</em>: the producer only waits for the broker to confirm that it has buffered the message and does not wait for the message to be processed by consumers.</p>\n<p>Some brokers can even participate in two-phase commit protocols using XA and JTA. This makes them similar to databases, aside some practical differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most message brokers automatically delete a message when it has been successfully delivered to its consumers. This makes them not suitable for long-term storage.</li>\n<li>Most message brokers assume that their working set is fairly small. If the broker needs to buffer a lot of messages, each individual message takes longer to process, and the overall throughput may degrade.</li>\n<li>Message brokers often support some way of subscribing to a subset of topics matching some pattern.</li>\n<li>Message brokers do not support arbitrary queries, but they do notify clients when data changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the traditional view of message brokers, encapsulated in standards like JMS and AMQP, and implemented in RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, HornetQ, Qpid, TIBCO Enterprise Message Service, IBM MQ, Azure Service Bus, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.</p>\n<p>When multiple consumers read messages in the same topic, to main patterns are used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Load balancing: Each message is delivered to <em>one</em> of the consumers. The broker may assign messages to consumers arbitrarily.</li>\n<li>Fan-out: Each message is delivered to <em>all</em> of the consumers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to ensure that the message is not lost, message brokers use <em>acknowledgements</em>: a client must explicitly tell the broker when it has finished processing a message so that the broker can remove it from the queue.</p>\n<p>The combination of laod balancing with redelivery inevitably leads to messages being reordered.

This is not the case with AMQP/JMS-style messaging: receiving a message is destructive if the acknowledgement causes it to be deleted from the broker.</p>\n<p>If you add a new consumer to a messaging system, any prior messages are already gone and cannot be recovered.</p>\n<p>We can have a hybrid, combining the durable storage approach of databases with the low-latency notifications facilities of messaging, this is the idea behind <em>log-based message brokers</em>.</p>\n<p>A log is simply an append-only sequence of records on disk. The same structure can be used to implement a message broker: a producer sends a message by appending it to the end of the log, and consumer receives messages by reading the log sequentially. If a consumer reaches the end of the log, it waits for a notification that a new message has been appended.</p>\n<p>To scale to higher throughput than a single disk can offer, the log can be <em>partitioned</em>. Different partitions can then be hosted on different machines. A topic can then be defined as a group of partitions that all carry messages of the same type.</p>\n<p>Within each partition, the broker assigns monotonically increasing sequence number, or <em>offset</em>, to every message.</p>\n<p>Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis Streams, and Twitter’s DistributedLog, are log-based message brokers that work like this.</p>\n<p>The log-based approach trivially supports fan-out messaging, as several consumers can independently read the log reading without affecint each other. Reading a message does not delete it from the log. To eachieve load balancing the broker can assign entire partitions to nodes in the consumer group. Each client then consumes <em>all</em> the messages in the partition it has been assigned. This approach has some downsides.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of nodes sharing the work of consuming a topic can be at most the number of log partitions in that topic.</li>\n<li>If a single message is slow to process, it holds up the processing of subsequent messages in that partition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In situations where messages may be expensive to process and you want to pararellise processing on a message-by-message basis, and where message ordering is not so important, the JMS/AMQP style of message broker is preferable. In situations with high message throughput, where each message is fast to process and where message ordering is important, the log-based approach works very well.</p>\n<p>It is easy to tell which messages have been processed: al messages with an offset less than a consumer current offset have already been processed, and all messages with a greater offset have not yet been seen.</p>\n<p>The offset is very similar to the <em>log sequence number</em> that is commonly found in single-leader database replication. The message broker behaves like a leader database, and the consumer like a follower.</p>\n<p>If a consumer node fails, another node in the consumer group starts consuming messages at the last recorded offset. If the consumer had processed subsequent messages but not yet recorded their offset, those messages will be processed a second time upon restart.</p>\n<p>If you only ever append the log, you will eventually run out of disk space. From time to time old segments are deleted or moved to archive.</p>\n<p>If a slow consumer cannot keep with the rate of messages, and it falls so far behind that its consumer offset poitns to a deleted segment, it will miss some of the messages.</p>\n<p>The throughput of a log remains more or less constant, since every message is written to disk anyway. This is in contrast to messaging systems that keep messages in memory by default and only write them to disk if the queue grows too large: systems are fast when queues are short and become much slower when they start writing to disk, throughput depends on the amount of history retained.</p>\n<p>If a consumer cannot keep up with producers, the consumer can drop messages, buffer them or applying backpressure.</p>\n<p>You can monitor how far a consumer is behind the head of the log, and raise an alert if it falls behind significantly.</p>\n<p>If a consumer does fall too far behind and start missing messages, only that consumer is affected.</p>\n<p>With AMQP and JMS-style message brokers, processing and acknowledging messages is a destructive operation, since it causes the messages to be deleted on the broker. In a log-based message broker, consuming messages is more like reading from a file.</p>\n<p>The offset is under the consumer’s control, so you can easily be manipulated if necessary, like for replaying old messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"databases-and-streams\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#databases-and-streams\" aria-label=\"databases and streams permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Databases and streams</h3>\n<p>A replciation log is a stream of a database write events, produced by the leader as it processes transactions. Followers apply that stream of writes to their own copy of the database and thus end up with an accurate copy of the same data.</p>\n<p>If periodic full database dumps are too slow, an alternative that is sometimes used is <em>dual writes</em>. For example, writing to the database, then updating the search index, then invalidating the cache.</p>\n<p>Dual writes have some serious problems, one of which is race conditions. If you have concurrent writes, one value will simply silently overwrite another value.</p>\n<p>One of the writes may fail while the other succeeds and two systems will become inconsistent.</p>\n<p>The problem with most databases replication logs is that they are considered an internal implementation detail, not a public API.</p>\n<p>Recently there has been a growing interest in <em>change data capture</em> (CDC), which is the process of observing all data changes written to a database and extracting them in a form in which they can be replicated to other systems.</p>\n<p>For example, you can capture the changes in a database and continually apply the same changes to a search index.</p>\n<p>We can call log consumers <em>derived data systems</em>: the data stored in the search index and the data warehouse is just another view. Change data capture is a mechanism for ensuring that all changes made to the system of record are also reflected in the derived data systems.</p>\n<p>Change data capture makes one database the leader, and turns the others into followers.</p>\n<p>Database triggers can be used to implement change data capture, but they tend to be fragile and have significant performance overheads. Parsing the replication log can be a more robust approach.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn’s Databus, Facebook’s Wormhole, and Yahoo!‘s Sherpa use this idea at large scale. Bottled Watter implements CDC for PostgreSQL decoding the write-ahead log, Maxwell and Debezium for something similar for MySQL by parsing the binlog, Mongoriver reads the MongoDB oplog, and GoldenGate provide similar facilities for Oracle.</p>\n<p>Keeping all changes forever would require too much disk space, and replaying it would take too long, so the log needs to be truncated.</p>\n<p>You can start with a consistent snapshot of the database, and it must correspond to a known position or offset in the change log.</p>\n<p>The storage engine periodically looks for log records with the same key, throws away any duplicates, and keeps only the most recent update for each key.</p>\n<p>An update with a special null value (a <em>tombstone</em>) indicates that a key was deleted.</p>\n<p>The same idea works in the context of log-based mesage brokers and change data capture.</p>\n<p>RethinkDB allows queries to subscribe to notifications, Firebase and CouchDB provide data synchronisation based on change feed.</p>\n<p>Kafka Connect integrates change data capture tools for a wide range of database systems with Kafka.</p>\n<h4 id=\"event-sourcing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#event-sourcing\" aria-label=\"event sourcing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Event sourcing</h4>\n<p>There are some parallels between the ideas we’ve discussed here and <em>event sourcing</em>.</p>\n<p>Similarly to change data capture, event sourcing involves storing all changes to the application state as a log of change events. Event sourcing applyies the idea at a different level of abstraction.</p>\n<p>Event sourcing makes it easier to evolve applications over time, helps with debugging by making it easier to understand after the fact why something happened, and guards against application bugs.</p>\n<p>Specialised databases such as Event Store have been developed to support applications using event sourcing.</p>\n<p>Applications that use event sourcing need to take the log of evetns and transform it into application state that is suitable for showing to a user.</p>\n<p>Replying the event log allows you to reconstruct the current state of the system.</p>\n<p>Applications that use event sourcing typically have some mechanism for storing snapshots.</p>\n<p>Event sourcing philosophy is careful to distinguis between <em>events</em> and <em>commands</em>. When a request from a user first arrives, it is initially a command: it may still fail (like some integrity condition is violated). If the validation is successful, it becomes an event, which is durable and immutable.</p>\n<p>A consumer of the event stream is not allowed to reject an event: Any validation of a command needs to happen synchronously, before it becomes an event. For example, by using a serializable transaction that atomically validates the command and publishes the event.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the user request to serve a seat could be split into two events: first a tentative reservation, and then a separate confirmation event once the reservation has been validated. This split allows the validation to take place in an asynchronous process.</p>\n<p>Whenever you have state changes, that state is the result of the events that mutated it over time.</p>\n<p>Mutable state and an append-only log of immutable events do not contradict each other.</p>\n<p>As an example, financial bookkeeping is recorded as an append-only <em>ledger</em>. It is a log of events describing money, good, or services that have changed hands. Profit and loss or the balance sheet are derived from the ledger by adding them up.</p>\n<p>If a mistake is made, accountants don’t erase or change the incorrect transaction, instead, they add another transaction that compensates for the mistake.</p>\n<p>If buggy code writes bad data to a database, recovery is much harder if the code is able to destructively overwrite data.</p>\n<p>Immutable events also capture more information than just the current state. If you persisted a cart into a regular database, deleting an item would effectively loose that event.</p>\n<p>You can derive views from the same event log, Druid ingests directly from Kafka, Pistachio is a distributed key-value sotre that uses Kafka as a commit log, Kafka Connect sinks can export data from Kafka to various different databases and indexes.</p>\n<p>Storing data is normally quite straightforward if you don’t have to worry about how it is going to be queried and accessed. You gain a lot of flexibility by separating the form in which data is written from the form it is read, this idea is known as <em>command query responsibility segregation</em> (CQRS).</p>\n<p>There is this fallacy that data must be written in the same form as it will be queried.</p>\n<p>The biggest downside of event sourcing and change data capture is that consumers of the event log are usually asynchronous, a user may make a write to the log, then read from a log derived view and find that their write has not yet been reflected.</p>\n<p>The limitations on immutable event history depends on the amount of churn in the dataset. Some workloads mostly add data and rarely update or delete; they are wasy to make immutable. Other workloads have a high rate of updates and deletes on a comparaively small dataset; in these cases immutable history becomes an issue because of fragmentation, performance compaction and garbage collection.</p>\n<p>There may also be circumstances in which you need data to be deleted for administrative reasons.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you may want to rewrite history, Datomic calls this feature <em>excision</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"processing-streams\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#processing-streams\" aria-label=\"processing streams permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Processing Streams</h3>\n<p>What you can do with the stream once you have it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can take the data in the events and write it to the database, cache, search index, or similar storage system, from where it can thenbe queried by other clients.</li>\n<li>You can push the events to users in some way, for example by sending email alerts or push notifications, or to a real-time dashboard.</li>\n<li>You can process one or more input streams to produce one or more output streams.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Processing streams to produce other, derived streams is what an <em>operator job</em> does. The one crucial difference to batch jobs is that a stream never ends.</p>\n<p><em>Complex event processing</em> (CEP) is an approach for analising event streams where you can specify rules to search for certain patterns of events in them.</p>\n<p>When a match is found, the engine emits a <em>complex event</em>.</p>\n<p>Queries are stored long-term, and events from the input streams continuously flow past them in search of a query that matches an event pattern.</p>\n<p>Implementations of CEP include Esper, IBM InfoSphere Streams, Apama, TIBCO StreamBase, and SQLstream.</p>\n<p>The boundary between CEP and stream analytics is blurry, analytics tends to be less interested in finding specific event sequences and is more oriented toward aggregations and statistical metrics.</p>\n<p>Frameworks with analytics in mind are: Apache Storm, Spark Streaming, Flink, Concord, Samza, and Kafka Streams. Hosted services include Google Cloud Dataflow and Azure Stream Analytics.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there is a need to search for individual events continually, such as full-text search queries over streams.</p>\n<p>Message-passing ystems are also based on messages and events, we normally don’t think of them as stream processors.</p>\n<p>There is some crossover area between RPC-like systems and stream processing. Apache Storm has a feature called <em>distributed RPC</em>.</p>\n<p>In a batch process, the time at which the process is run has nothing to do with the time at which the events actually occurred.</p>\n<p>Many stream processing frameworks use the local system clock on the processing machine (<em>processing time</em>) to determine windowing. It is a simple approach that breaks down if there is any significant processing lag.</p>\n<p>Confusing event time and processing time leads to bad data. Processing time may be unreliable as the stream processor may queue events, restart, etc. It’s better to take into account the original event time to count rates.</p>\n<p>You can never be sure when you have received all the events.</p>\n<p>You can time out and declare a window ready after you have not seen any new events for a while, but it could still happen that some events are delayed due a network interruption. You need to be able to handle such <em>stranggler</em> events that arrive after the window has already been declared complete.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can ignore the stranggler events, tracking the number of dropped events as a metric.</li>\n<li>Publish a <em>correction</em>, an updated value for the window with stranglers included. You may also need to retrat the previous output.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To adjust for incofrrect device clocks, one approach is to log three timestamps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The time at which the event occurred, according to the device clock</li>\n<li>The time at which the event was sent to the server, according to the device clock</li>\n<li>The time at which the event was received by the server, according to the server clock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can estimate the offset between the device clock and the server clock, then apply that offset to the event timestamp, and thus estimate the true time at which the event actually ocurred.</p>\n<p>Several types of windows are in common use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tumbling window: Fixed length. If you have a 1-minute tumbling window, all events between 10:03:00 and 10:03:59 will be grouped in one window, next window would be 10:04:00-10:04:59</li>\n<li>Hopping window: Fixed length, but allows windows to overlap in order to provide some smoothing. If you have a 5-minute window with a hop size of 1 minute, it would contain the events between 10:03:00 and 10:07:59, next window would cover 10:04:00-10:08:59</li>\n<li>Sliding window: Events that occur within some interval of each other. For example, a 5-minute sliding window would cover 10:03:39 and 10:08:12 because they are less than 4 minutes apart.</li>\n<li>Session window: No fixed duration. All events for the same user, the window ends when the user has been inactive for some time (30 minutes). Common in website analytics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fact that new events can appear anytime on a stream makes joins on stream challenging.</p>\n<h4 id=\"stream-stream-joins\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#stream-stream-joins\" aria-label=\"stream stream joins permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Stream-stream joins</h4>\n<p>You want to detect recent trends in searched-for URLs.

You can tell wether an update has already been applied.</p>\n<p>Idempotent operations can be an effective way of achieving exactly-once semantics with only a small overhead.</p>\n<p>Any stream process that requires state must ensure tha this state can be recovered after a failure.</p>\n<p>One option is to keep the state in a remote datastore and replicate it, but it is slow.</p>\n<p>An alternative is to keep state local to the stream processor and replicate it periodically.</p>\n<p>Flink periodically captures snapshots and writes them to durable storage such as HDFS; Samza and Kafka Streams replicate state changes by sending them to a dedicated Kafka topic with log compaction. VoltDB replicates state by redundantly processing each input message on several nodes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-data-systems\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-future-of-data-systems\" aria-label=\"the future of data systems permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The future of data systems</h2>\n<h3 id=\"data-integration\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#data-integration\" aria-label=\"data integration permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Data integration</h3>\n<p>Updating a derived data system based on an event log can often be made determinisitic and idempotent.</p>\n<p>Distributed transactions decide on an ordering of writes by using locks for mutual exclusion, while CDC and event sourcing use a log for ordering.

Apache Flink performs batch processing in top of stream processing.</p>\n<p>Batch processing has a quite strong functional flavour. The output depends only on the input, there are no side-effects. Stream processing is similar but it allows managed, fault-tolerant state.</p>\n<p>Derived data systems could be maintained synchronously. However, asynchrony is what makes systems based on event logs robust: it allows a fault in one part of the system to be contained locally.</p>\n<p>Stream processing allows changes in the input to be reflected in derived views with low delay, whereas batch processing allows large amounts of accumulated historical data to be reprocessed in order to derive new views onto an existing dataset.</p>\n<p>Derived views allow <em>gradual</em> evolution. If you want to restructure a dataset, you do not need to perform the migration as a sudden switch. Instead, you can maintain the old schema and the new schema side by side as two independent derived views onto the same underlying data, eventually you can drop the old view.</p>\n<h4 id=\"lambda-architecture\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#lambda-architecture\" aria-label=\"lambda architecture permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Lambda architecture</h4>\n<p>The whole idea behind lambda architecture is that incoming data should be recorded by appending immutable events to an always-growing dataset, similarly to event sourcing.

It is possible to provide a unified query interface to a wide variety of underlying storate engines and processing methods, this is known as <em>federated database</em> or <em>polystore</em>. An example is PostgreSQL’s <em>foreign data wrapper</em>.</li>\n<li>Unbundled databases: unifying writes. When we compose several storage systems, we need to ensure that all data changes end up in all the right places, even in the face of faults, it is like <em>unbundling</em> a database’s index-maintenance features in a way that can synchronise writes across disparate technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keeping the writes to several storage systems in sync is the harder engineering problem.</p>\n<p>Synchronising writes requires distributed transactions across heterogeneous storage systems which may be the wrong solution. An asynchronous event log with idempotent writes is a much more robust and practical approach.</p>\n<p>The big advantage is <em>loose coupling</em> between various components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Asynchronous event streams make the system as a whole more robust to outages or performance degradation of individual components.</li>\n<li>Unbundling data systems allows different software components and services to be developed, improved and maintained independently from each other by different teams.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If there is a single technology that does everything you need, you’re most likely best off simply using that product rather than trying to reimplement it yourself from lower-level components.

Favour of immutable and append-only data, because it is easier to recover from such mistakes.</p>\n<p>We’ve seen the idea of <em>exactly-once</em> (or <em>effectively-once</em>) semantics. If something goes wrong while processing a message, you can either give up or try again. If you try again, there is the risk that it actually succeeded the first time, the message ends up being processed twice.</p>\n<p><em>Exactly-once</em> means arranging the computation such that the final effect is the same as if no faults had occurred.</p>\n<p>One of the most effective approaches is to make the operation <em>idempotent</em>, to ensure that it has the same effect, no matter whether it is executed once or multiple times. Idempotence requires some effort and care: you may need to maintain some additional metadata (operation IDs), and ensure fencing when failing over from one node to another.</p>\n<p>Two-phase commit unfortunately is not sufficient to ensure that the transaction will only be executed once.</p>\n<p>You need to consider <em>end-to-end</em> flow of the request.</p>\n<p>You can generate a unique identifier for an operation (such as a UUID) and include it as a hidden form field in the client application, or calculate a hash of all the relevant form fields to derive the operation ID. If the web browser submits the POST request twice, the two requests will have the same operation ID. You can then pass that operation ID all the way through to the database and check that you only ever execute one operation with a given ID. You can then save those requests to be processed, uniquely identified by the operation ID.</p>\n<p>Is not enough to prevent a user from submitting a duplicate request if the first one times out. Solving the problem requires an end-to-end solution: a transaction indentifier that is passed all the way from the end-user client to the database.</p>\n<p>Low-level reliability mechanisms such as those in TCP, work quite well, and so the remaining higher-level faults occur fairly rarely.</p>\n<p>Transactions have long been seen as a good abstraction, they are useful but not enough.</p>\n<p>It is worth exploring F=fault-tolerance abstractions that make it easy to provide application-specific end-to-end correctness properties, but also maintain good performance and good operational characteristics.</p>\n<h4 id=\"enforcing-constraints\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#enforcing-constraints\" aria-label=\"enforcing constraints permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Enforcing constraints</h4>\n<h5 id=\"uniqueness-constraints-require-consensus\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#uniqueness-constraints-require-consensus\" aria-label=\"uniqueness constraints require consensus permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Uniqueness constraints require consensus</h5>\n<p>The most common way of achieving consensus is to make a single node the leadder, and put it in charge of making all decisions.

Algorithms make mistakes too, but who is accountable if they go wrong?</p>\n<p>A credit score summarises “How did you behave in the past?” whereas predictive analytics usually work on the basis of “Who is similar to you, and how did people like you behave in the past?” Drawing parallels to others’ behaviour implies stereotyping people.</p>\n<p>We will also need to figure outhow to prevent data being used to harm people, and realise its positive potential instead, this power could be used to focus aid an support to help people who most need it.</p>\n<p>When services become good at predicting what content users want to se, they may end up showing people only opinions they already agree with, leading to echo chambers in which stereotypes, misinformation and polaristaion can breed.</p>\n<p>Many consequences can be predicted by thinking about the entire system (not just the computerised parts), an approach known as <em>systems thinking</em>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"privacy-and-tracking\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#privacy-and-tracking\" aria-label=\"privacy and tracking permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Privacy and tracking</h4>\n<p>When a system only stores data that a user has explicitly entered, because they want the system to store and process it in a certain way, the system is performing a service for the user: the user is the customer.</p>\n<p>But when a user’s activity is tracked and logged as a side effect of other things they are doing, the relationship is less clear. The service no longer just does what the users tells it to do, but it takes on interests of its own, which may conflict with the user’s interest.</p>\n<p>If the service is funded through advertising, the advertirsers are the actual customers, and the users’ interests take second place.</p>\n<p>The user is given a free service and is coaxed into engaging with it as much as possible. The tracking of the user serves the needs of the advertirses who are funding the service. This is basically <em>surveillance</em>.</p>\n<p>As a thougt experiment, try replacing the word <em>data</em> with <em>surveillance</em>.</p>\n<p>Even themost totalitarian and repressive regimes could only dream of putting a microphone in every room and forcing every person to constantly carry a device capable of tracking their location and movements. Yet we apparently voluntarily, even enthusiastically, throw ourselves into this world of total surveillance. The difference is just that the data is being collected by corporations rather than government agencies.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you feel you have nothing to hide, you are totally in line with existing power structures, you are not a marginalised minority, and you needn’t fear persecution. Not everyone is so fortunate.</p>\n<p>Without understanding what happens to their data, users cannot give any meaningful consent. Often, data from one user also says things about other people who are not users of the service and who have not agreed to any terms.</p>\n<p>For a user who does not consent to surveillance, the only real alternative is simply to not user the service. But this choice is not free either: if a service is so popular that it is “regarded by most people as essential for basic social participation”, then it is not reasonable to expect people to opt out of this service. Especially when a service has network effects, there is a social cost to people choosing <em>not</em> to use it.</p>\n<p>Declining to use a service due to its tracking of users is only an option for the small number of people who are priviledged enough to have the time and knowledge to understand its privacy policy, and who can affort to potentially miss out on social participation or professional opportunities that may have arisen if they ahd participated in the service. For people in a less priviledged position, there is no meaningful freedom of choice: surveillance becomes inescapable.</p>\n<p>Having privacy does not mean keeping everything secret; it means having the freedom to choose which things to reveal to whom, what to make public, and what to keep secret.</p>\n<p>Companies that acquire data essentially say “trust us to do the right thing with your data” which means that the right to decide what to reveal and what to keep secret is transferred from the individual to the company.</p>\n<p>Even if the service promises not to sell the data to third parties, it usually grants itself unrestricted rights to process and analyse the data internally, often going much further than what is overtly visible to users.</p>\n<p>If targeted advertising is what pays for a service, then behavioral data about people is the service’s core asset.</p>\n<p>When collecting data, we need to consider not just today’s political environment, but also future governments too. There is no guarantee that every government elected in the future will respect human rights and civil liberties, so “it is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that could someday facilitate a police state”.</p>\n<p>To scrutinise others while avoiding scrutiny oneself is one of the most important forms of power.</p>\n<p>In the industrial revolution tt took a long time before safeguards were established, such as environmental protection regulations, safety protocols for workplaces, outlawing child labor, and health inspections for food. Undoubtedly the cost of doing business increased when factories could no longer dump their waste into rivers, sell tainted foods, or exploit workers. But society as a whole benefited hugely, and few of us would want to return to a time before those regulations.</p>\n<p>We should stop regarding users as metrics to be optimised, and remember that they are humans who deserve respect, dignity, and agency. We should self-regulate our data collection and processing practices in order to establish an maintain the trust of the people who depend on our software. And we should take it upon ourselves to educate end users about how their data is used, rather than keeping them in the dark.</p>\n<p>We should allow each individual to maintain their privacy, their control over their own data, and not steal that control from them through surveillance.</p>\n<p>We should not retain data forever, but purge it as soon as it is no longer needed.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://oliver-hu.medium.com/systems-performance-reading-notes-chapter-6-cpu-d70627188b85\">https://oliver-hu.medium.com/systems-performance-reading-notes-chapter-6-cpu-d70627188b85</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://oliver-hu.medium.com/systems-performance-reading-notes-chapter-7-memory-6e87ac8fcfdd\">https://oliver-hu.medium.com/systems-performance-reading-notes-chapter-7-memory-6e87ac8fcfdd</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://oliver-hu.medium.com/system-performance-chapter-8-file-system-7322f82fbc7c\">https://oliver-hu.medium.com/system-performance-chapter-8-file-system-7322f82fbc7c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lrita.github.io/images/posts/linux/Percona2016_LinuxSystemsPerf.pdf\">https://lrita.github.io/images/posts/linux/Percona2016_LinuxSystemsPerf.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.brendangregg.com/USEmethod/use-rosetta.html\">https://www.brendangregg.com/USEmethod/use-rosetta.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.brendangregg.com/linuxperf.html\">https://www.brendangregg.com/linuxperf.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/08/02/Perf-measurement-environment-on-Linux\">https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/08/02/Perf-measurement-environment-on-Linux</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://elvischidera.com/2022-01-20-designing-data-intensive-applications\">https://elvischidera.com/2022-01-20-designing-data-intensive-applications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://danlebrero.com/2021/09/01/designing-data-intensive-applications-summary/\">https://danlebrero.com/2021/09/01/designing-data-intensive-applications-summary/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes/blob/master/books/designing-data-intensive-applications.md\">https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes/blob/master/books/designing-data-intensive-applications.md</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"design data intensive applications by Martin Kleppmann summary - wip","date":"July 23, 2024","description":"design data intensive applications by Martin Kleppmann summary"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/system-performance-summary/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"system performance summary - wip"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/observability-engineer-summary/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"observability engineer by Charity, Liz Fong and George summary - wip"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2751f99b-ef9f-5f5f-98ee-536ab1339c46","previousPostId":"c9dfadd8-9ae1-54ce-9d81-f62e36687316","nextPostId":"6c57d356-2304-58c4-9581-9a408fb3651c"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}

After subtracting the fee, you’re often left with below-average returns.\n<ul>\n<li>professional money managers can’t afford to perform lower than average for long periods because they keep need to keep their clients satisfied all the time. It’s difficult to hold onto a strategy which might not work for months or years at a time, no matter how effective the strategy is in the long term. You can, though, All it takes is some patience to stock with it during the good and not-so-good times.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>index fund such as Standard &#x26; Poor’s 500 Index is a mutual fund which aims to match the market’s best performing companies, as opposed to trying to beat them. Since index fund fees are lower, and because on average the market performs well, index funds often provide you with very healthy profits.</li>\n<li>the stock market values of most companies swing drastically over short time periods for no rational reason.</li>\n<li>consider “earnings yield” and the “return on capital” when putting together your investment portfolio\n<ul>\n<li>combine both earnings yield and ROC into one single measure.</li>\n<li>rank the companies based on Earnings Yield and ROC separately and then combine their scores by adding them the scores (ranks)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>earnings yield\n<ul>\n<li>tells you what the business earns in relation to its share price</li>\n<li>calculated by finding the ratio of earnings before interests expenses and tax (EBIT), to enterprise value (EV).

Smaller companies don’t have much to offer in terms of shares, so even a slight increase in demand can force their share price up. You may therefore find it challenging to buy their shares at a reasonable price.</li>\n<li>the strategies should include owning 20-30 large company stocks (in different industries) at a time. (I prefer to narrow the list less than 10, so I can read more about the companies and have a good reason why I want to buy the companies)</li>\n<li>use tax laws intelligently to maximize your profit\n<ul>\n<li>sell stocks which lost value before one-year holding period ends, which would decreases your yearly income and thus the taxes you will need to pay.</li>\n<li>sell the stocks which increase value after one-year holding period ends, which would reduce your tax on capital gains.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>buy stock only when its price is below its intrinsic value, its value as it relates to a company’s propensity for growth.

(portfolio of 10-20 stocks in different industries)</li>\n<li>understand that you don’t pull in extraordinary profits, but safe and steady revenues.</li>\n<li>the target for intelligent investor is to meet her personal needs, not to outperform the professional stockbrokers on Wall Street.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>understand the importance of stock-market history\n<ul>\n<li>economic crises, the unpredictability of the market means that investors need to be prepared - financially and psychologically to ensure that you can take a big hit and survive.</li>\n<li>don’t sell everything at the first sign of danger. Remember instead that, even after the most devastating crashes, the market will always recover.</li>\n<li>the history of the market will give you a better idea of its stability. Once you’ve determined that the market is stable, focus on the history of the company in which you’d like to invest.\n<ul>\n<li>look at the correlation between stock price and the company’s earnings and dividends over the past 10 years. Then consider the inflation rate, in order to see how much you’d really earn.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"investment-philosophy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

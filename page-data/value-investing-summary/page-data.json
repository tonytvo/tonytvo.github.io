Value investors have to know what they know and know what they don’t know. The best tend to specialize in one area and develop a real understanding of its economics, since a big, meaningful gap exists between “undervalued” and “cheap.” Value investors have to wait until a real bargain comes along. When they find and buy it, they have to wait until the market recognizes the fundamental value and the market price adjusts.

Work from the top down. Some values have to be adjusted because accounting numbers are more accurate for some assets and liabilities than for others. What matters is the assets’ value if they were sold today. If an industry is on the path to extinction, its equipment and inventory may not have more than scrap value. If the industry will continue to exist, the proper value is the “reproduction value,” the cost of replacing the asset. In general, items at the top of the balance sheet - cash, receivables, inventory - have values close to the book value. The book value is more questionable farther down the balance sheet. Usually it’s possible to come up with an estimate more reliable than an estimate of future earnings. The assets and liabilities are real, exist now and do have some value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>reproduction cost of an asset is the most appropriate measure of its worth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the industry to viable, then sooner or later the assets are going to be replaced, so you have to look at the costs of reproducing those assets as efficient as possible.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/how-to-asset-reproduction-value-analysis/\">asset reproduction value analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the second most reliable measure of a firm’s intrinsic value is the value of its current earnings, properly adjusted. This value can be estimated with more certainty than future earnings or cash flows, and it is more relevant to today’s values than are earnings in the past.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>earnings, if they are sustainable, are supported by assets or barriers to entry.</li>\n<li>Cash flow - Benjamin Graham and David Dodd used the Earnings Power Value (EPV) formula to calculate the level of distributable cash flow that a company could reasonably sustain. The formula is: “EPV = Adjusted Earnings x 1/R, where R is the current cost of capital.” Because companies often artificially inflate earnings by booking some costs as allegedly non-recurring, the savvy value investor researches the history, calculates the usual ratio of such charges to reported earnings and reduces current reported earnings appropriately. The investor may need to make a similar adjustment for depreciation and amortization, which can also misrepresent the real need to reinvest. Finally, the investor considers the business cycle, adjusting earnings based on whether the company is at its top or bottom. The EPV must be sustainable. For assurance that it is, look for sustaining strategic advantages like franchise value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unless there is something to interfere with this process of entry, sooner or later the market value of the company will be driven down to the reproduction value of the assets. <em>Reversion to the Mean or the Uniformity of One Price</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have EPV in excess of reproduction value (AV) of the assets, there had better be something to interfere with the process of entry such as competitive advantage such as barriers of entry, etc…</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>then and only then you should worry about growth</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>the only case where growth has value is where the growth occurs behind the protection of an identifiable competitive advantage</strong></li>\n<li><strong>growth only has value if it is a strong franchise</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You have to adjust for any accounting shenanigans that are going on, you have to adjust for the cyclical situation, for the tax situation that may be short-lived, for excess depreciation over the cost of maintenance capital expense (MCX). And really for anything else that is going on that is causing current earnings to deviate from long run sustainable earnings. So <strong>valuation is calculated by a company’s long-run sustainable earnings multiplied by 1/cost of capital</strong>.</li>\n<li>entry barriers: A franchise only has value when competitors can’t easily enter the market and take chunks of it away. Only a few things create real barriers to entry:\n<ul>\n<li>Government - Licenses and other legally protected privileges, e.g. cable franchises.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Costs\n- Expense creates a barrier if the incumbent has cost advantages no one can duplicate, especially patents or proprietary knowledge a competitor can’t match or buy. Economies of scale matter; if unit costs fall as more units are produced, a new entrant can’t match a high-volume leader (absent new technology or processes).\n- Revenues - In rare cases, customers are so attached to a particular brand (think Coca-Cola) that it is very difficult for a new entrant to seduce them. Also, costly switching virtually traps customers, i.e., buyers of corporate software suites must also train staff and debug. Here, the cost of switching helps protect Microsoft’s franchise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AV > EPV\n<ul>\n<li>Use the EPV as a guide to intrinsic value. Either management is doing a bad job (and could only be dislodged in a takeover) or the industry suffers from overcapacity (so increased value requires reduced capacity).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>AV approximately equal to EPV\n<ul>\n<li>It tells a story of an industry that is in balance. It is exactly what you would expect to see if there were no barriers-to- entry.</li>\n<li>Management is probably mediocre and the firm lacks a competitive edge. To check, examine management’s returns and judge whether they are about average. Is the industry stable, or do competitors come and go?

voting machine, but in the long term it tracks value”</p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock.</p>\n<p>“The best predictor of a mutual fund’s future investment return is not the number of Morningstar stars it receives, but how low its expense ratio is.”</p>\n<p>“Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand.”</p>\n<p>“We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price.”</p>\n<p>price is what you pay, value is what you get</p>\n<p>once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling.</p>\n<p>the key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for.</p>\n<p>“financial markets, far from accurately reflecting all the available knowledge, always provide a distorted view of reality. This is the principle of fallibility. The degree of distortion may vary from time to time. Sometimes, it’s quite insignificant, at other times, it is quite pronounced.</p>\n<p>Every bubble has 2 components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. When a positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, a boom-bust process is set in motion. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced.</p>\n<p>Investing may not be neurosurgery, but it isn’t child’s play either.</p>\n<p>“To recall a piece of wisdom Warren Buffett frequently cites, if you have been in the poker game for thirty minutes and still don’t know who the patsy is, you can be pretty certain the patsy is you.”</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@peter.simon419/value-investing-from-graham-to-buffett-and-beyond-by-greenwald-notes-d2c97d014ee5#:~:text=Value%20investors%20believe%20that%20financial,significantly%20from%20this%20intrinsic%20value\">https://medium.com/@peter.simon419/value-investing-from-graham-to-buffett-and-beyond-by-greenwald-notes-d2c97d014ee5#:~:text=Value%20investors%20believe%20that%20financial,significantly%20from%20this%20intrinsic%20value</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prasadcapital.com/2013/03/25/book-summary-value-investing-from-graham-to-buffett-and-beyond/\">https://prasadcapital.com/2013/03/25/book-summary-value-investing-from-graham-to-buffett-and-beyond/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/20767c39bf85b36bda85c0c2542a16e7/global-value.pdf\">Global Value</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/fd585c1fdf7dc54136e30868d2f10a44/Invest-with-the-House.pdf\">Invest with the House</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.portfolioeinstein.com/meb-faber-portfolios-backed-by-solid-research/\">https://www.portfolioeinstein.com/meb-faber-portfolios-backed-by-solid-research/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://milliondollarjourney.com/stock-hedging-strategies.htm\">https://milliondollarjourney.com/stock-hedging-strategies.htm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.getstoryshots.com/books/the-intelligent-investor-summary/#:~:text=margin%20of%20safety.-,Introduction,speculations%20(based%20on%20predictions)\">https://www.getstoryshots.com/books/the-intelligent-investor-summary/#:~:text=margin%20of%20safety.-,Introduction,speculations%20(based%20on%20predictions)</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://milliondollarjourney.com/options-trading-buying-and-selling-calls-puts-for-hedging-profit.htm\">https://milliondollarjourney.com/options-trading-buying-and-selling-calls-puts-for-hedging-profit.htm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI84Sf0aDgaxGozvfNAKLonKIoD-sDeDp\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI84Sf0aDgaxGozvfNAKLonKIoD-sDeDp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://diggingforvalue.com/book-summary/security-analysis/\">https://diggingforvalue.com/book-summary/security-analysis/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.buffettsbooks.com/how-to-invest-in-stocks/intermediate-course/\">https://www.buffettsbooks.com/how-to-invest-in-stocks/intermediate-course/</a></li>\n<li>[Thinking in systems](Thinking in Systems)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMdnaRQ4EOE&#x26;list=PLI84Sf0aDgayIYZFsvStDXGOwy2pLgYW3&#x26;ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMdnaRQ4EOE&#x26;list=PLI84Sf0aDgayIYZFsvStDXGOwy2pLgYW3&#x26;ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npoyc_X5zO8&#x26;list=PLI84Sf0aDgazJz6aVmUAYwfmCkTDd_cqv&#x26;ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npoyc_X5zO8&#x26;list=PLI84Sf0aDgazJz6aVmUAYwfmCkTDd_cqv&#x26;ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMdnaRQ4EOE&#x26;list=PLI84Sf0aDgayIYZFsvStDXGOwy2pLgYW3&#x26;ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMdnaRQ4EOE&#x26;list=PLI84Sf0aDgayIYZFsvStDXGOwy2pLgYW3&#x26;ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI84Sf0aDgaxGozvfNAKLonKIoD-sDeDp\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI84Sf0aDgaxGozvfNAKLonKIoD-sDeDp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://novelinvestor.com/notes/the-intelligent-investor-by-benjamin-graham/\">https://novelinvestor.com/notes/the-intelligent-investor-by-benjamin-graham/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"value investing summary -

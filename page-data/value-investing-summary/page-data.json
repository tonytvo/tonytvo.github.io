Value investors have to know what they know and know what they don’t know. The best tend to specialize in one area and develop a real understanding of its economics, since a big, meaningful gap exists between “undervalued” and “cheap.” Value investors have to wait until a real bargain comes along. When they find and buy it, they have to wait until the market recognizes the fundamental value and the market price adjusts.

Work from the top down. Some values have to be adjusted because accounting numbers are more accurate for some assets and liabilities than for others. What matters is the assets’ value if they were sold today. If an industry is on the path to extinction, its equipment and inventory may not have more than scrap value. If the industry will continue to exist, the proper value is the “reproduction value,” the cost of replacing the asset. In general, items at the top of the balance sheet - cash, receivables, inventory - have values close to the book value. The book value is more questionable farther down the balance sheet. Usually it’s possible to come up with an estimate more reliable than an estimate of future earnings. The assets and liabilities are real, exist now and do have some value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>reproduction cost of an asset is the most appropriate measure of its worth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the industry to viable, then sooner or later the assets are going to be replaced, so you have to look at the costs of reproducing those assets as efficient as possible.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/how-to-asset-reproduction-value-analysis/\">asset reproduction value analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the second most reliable measure of a firm’s intrinsic value is the value of its current earnings, properly adjusted. This value can be estimated with more certainty than future earnings or cash flows, and it is more relevant to today’s values than are earnings in the past.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>earnings, if they are sustainable, are supported by assets or barriers to entry.</li>\n<li>Cash flow - Benjamin Graham and David Dodd used the Earnings Power Value (EPV) formula to calculate the level of distributable cash flow that a company could reasonably sustain. The formula is: “EPV = Adjusted Earnings x 1/R, where R is the current cost of capital.” Because companies often artificially inflate earnings by booking some costs as allegedly non-recurring, the savvy value investor researches the history, calculates the usual ratio of such charges to reported earnings and reduces current reported earnings appropriately. The investor may need to make a similar adjustment for depreciation and amortization, which can also misrepresent the real need to reinvest. Finally, the investor considers the business cycle, adjusting earnings based on whether the company is at its top or bottom. The EPV must be sustainable. For assurance that it is, look for sustaining strategic advantages like franchise value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unless there is something to interfere with this process of entry, sooner or later the market value of the company will be driven down to the reproduction value of the assets. <em>Reversion to the Mean or the Uniformity of One Price</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have EPV in excess of reproduction value (AV) of the assets, there had better be something to interfere with the process of entry such as competitive advantage such as barriers of entry, etc…</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>then and only then you should worry about growth</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>the only case where growth has value is where the growth occurs behind the protection of an identifiable competitive advantage</strong></li>\n<li><strong>growth only has value if it is a strong franchise</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You have to adjust for any accounting shenanigans that are going on, you have to adjust for the cyclical situation, for the tax situation that may be short-lived, for excess depreciation over the cost of maintenance capital expense (MCX). And really for anything else that is going on that is causing current earnings to deviate from long run sustainable earnings. So <strong>valuation is calculated by a company’s long-run sustainable earnings multiplied by 1/cost of capital</strong>.</li>\n<li>entry barriers: A franchise only has value when competitors can’t easily enter the market and take chunks of it away. Only a few things create real barriers to entry:\n<ul>\n<li>Government - Licenses and other legally protected privileges, e.g. cable franchises.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Costs\n- Expense creates a barrier if the incumbent has cost advantages no one can duplicate, especially patents or proprietary knowledge a competitor can’t match or buy. Economies of scale matter; if unit costs fall as more units are produced, a new entrant can’t match a high-volume leader (absent new technology or processes).\n- Revenues - In rare cases, customers are so attached to a particular brand (think Coca-Cola) that it is very difficult for a new entrant to seduce them. Also, costly switching virtually traps customers, i.e., buyers of corporate software suites must also train staff and debug. Here, the cost of switching helps protect Microsoft’s franchise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AV > EPV\n<ul>\n<li>Use the EPV as a guide to intrinsic value. Either management is doing a bad job (and could only be dislodged in a takeover) or the industry suffers from overcapacity (so increased value requires reduced capacity).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>AV approximately equal to EPV\n<ul>\n<li>It tells a story of an industry that is in balance. It is exactly what you would expect to see if there were no barriers-to- entry.</li>\n<li>Management is probably mediocre and the firm lacks a competitive edge. To check, examine management’s returns and judge whether they are about average. Is the industry stable, or do competitors come and go?

share</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the sustainable competitive advantage cannot be duplicated by competitors; hence the business will keep pouring money into the owners’ pockets.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, Coca-Cola has a great moat due to its enormous brand value, share of mind</li>\n<li>Wal-Mart has a wide moat due to its cost structure where it can buy products with large volume from its suppliers at a cheaper price than its competitors.</li>\n<li>Apple has networks effect: the more people join apple community the more profit it made</li>\n<li>Geico has low cost when price significant to customers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sample moats from different industries. High cost of switching to Samsung even iphone is more expensive\n<ul>\n<li>intangible assets such as brands and patents\n<ul>\n<li>Disney is a strong brand and almost everyone in the world recognizes it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>low cost\n<ul>\n<li>Wal-Mart can buy at quantities and prices that competitors can’t match.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>high switching costs (“stickiness”)\n<ul>\n<li>most people will not bother with the hassle of changing operating system such as Microsoft, because they do not want to re-learn the new system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>porter 5 forces\n<ul>\n<li><strong>barriers to entry</strong>: advantages that existing, established companies have over new entrants. A firm will enter the industry it it forecasts that the potential reward for being in it is greater than the cost of overcoming the barriers and the retaliation that is likely to happen.\n<ul>\n<li>supply-side economies of scale: spread the fixed costs over a larger volume of units.</li>\n<li>demand-side benefits of scale: network effect, people tend to value being in a ‘network’ with a larger number of people who use the same company.</li>\n<li>customer switching costs: airline frequent flyer programs are an example. Customer doesn’t want to switch to different product to avoid re-learning (such as microsoft operating system, or iphone)</li>\n<li>capital requirements: websites and apps can be launched cheaply and easily as opposed to the brick and mortar industries of the past. Railroads are almost impossible to enter. It takes a ton of capital and it is an enormous risk to build a second railroad network next to to the existing one</li>\n<li>incumbency advantages independent of size (e.g. customer loyalty and brand equity)</li>\n<li>unequal access to distribution channels: new entrants may struggle to find a retail or wholesale channel to sell through as existing competitors will have a claim on them</li>\n<li>governmental policies</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>threat of substitutes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>perceived level of product differentiation: lowest price or differentiation. Developing multiple products for niche markets is one way to mitigate this factor.</li>\n<li>number of substitute products available in the market, ease of substitution, availability of close substitutes.</li>\n<li>substitutes that are becoming cheaper relative to performance and substitutes that earn high returns on capital are likely to have more new entries in the future, which will drive prices down within that industry.</li>\n<li>companies within industry of power grids face pretty much no substitute at all.

After subtracting the fee, you’re often left with below-average returns.\n<ul>\n<li>professional money managers can’t afford to perform lower than average for long periods because they keep need to keep their clients satisfied all the time. It’s difficult to hold onto a strategy which might not work for months or years at a time, no matter how effective the strategy is in the long term. You can, though, All it takes is some patience to stock with it during the good and not-so-good times.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>index fund such as Standard &#x26; Poor’s 500 Index is a mutual fund which aims to match the market’s best performing companies, as opposed to trying to beat them. Since index fund fees are lower, and because on average the market performs well, index funds often provide you with very healthy profits.</li>\n<li>the stock market values of most companies swing drastically over short time periods for no rational reason.</li>\n<li>consider “earnings yield” and the “return on capital” when putting together your investment portfolio\n<ul>\n<li>combine both earnings yield and ROC into one single measure.</li>\n<li>rank the companies based on Earnings Yield and ROC separately and then combine their scores by adding them the scores (ranks)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>earnings yield\n<ul>\n<li>tells you what the business earns in relation to its share price</li>\n<li>calculated by finding the ratio of earnings before interests expenses and tax (EBIT), to enterprise value (EV).

Smaller companies don’t have much to offer in terms of shares, so even a slight increase in demand can force their share price up. You may therefore find it challenging to buy their shares at a reasonable price.</li>\n<li>the strategies should include owning 20-30 large company stocks (in different industries) at a time. (I prefer to narrow the list less than 10, so I can read more about the companies and have a good reason why I want to buy the companies)</li>\n<li>use tax laws intelligently to maximize your profit\n<ul>\n<li>sell stocks which lost value before one-year holding period ends, which would decreases your yearly income and thus the taxes you will need to pay.</li>\n<li>sell the stocks which increase value after one-year holding period ends, which would reduce your tax on capital gains.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>buy stock only when its price is below its intrinsic value, its value as it relates to a company’s propensity for growth.

(portfolio of 10-20 stocks in different industries)</li>\n<li>understand that you don’t pull in extraordinary profits, but safe and steady revenues.</li>\n<li>the target for intelligent investor is to meet her personal needs, not to outperform the professional stockbrokers on Wall Street.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>understand the importance of stock-market history\n<ul>\n<li>economic crises, the unpredictability of the market means that investors need to be prepared - financially and psychologically to ensure that you can take a big hit and survive.</li>\n<li>don’t sell everything at the first sign of danger. Remember instead that, even after the most devastating crashes, the market will always recover.</li>\n<li>the history of the market will give you a better idea of its stability. Once you’ve determined that the market is stable, focus on the history of the company in which you’d like to invest.\n<ul>\n<li>look at the correlation between stock price and the company’s earnings and dividends over the past 10 years.

body of data into their analysis.”</p>\n<p>“Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful”</p>\n<p>“If you’re analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless”</p>\n<p>“In the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it tracks value”</p>\n<p>“A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock.”</p>\n<p>“The best predictor of a mutual fund’s future investment return is not the number of Morningstar stars it receives, but how low its expense ratio is.”</p>\n<p>“Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand.”</p>\n<p>“We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price.”</p>\n<p>“price is what you pay, value is what you get”</p>\n<p>once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling.</p>\n<p>the key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for.</p>\n<p>“financial markets, far from accurately reflecting all the available knowledge, always provide a distorted view of reality. This is the principle of fallibility. The degree of distortion may vary from time to time. Sometimes, it’s quite insignificant, at other times, it is quite pronounced.</p>\n<p>“Every bubble has 2 components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. When a positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, a boom-bust process is set in motion. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced.”</p>\n<p>“Investing may not be neurosurgery, but it isn’t child’s play either.”</p>\n<p>“To recall a piece of wisdom Warren Buffett frequently cites, if you have been in the poker game for thirty minutes and still don’t know who the patsy is, you can be pretty certain the patsy is you.”</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor

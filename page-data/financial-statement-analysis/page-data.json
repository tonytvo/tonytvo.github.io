He starts at the source, where the water enters the main valve into the house (the net income), and ends at the sink (the growing/decreasing equity and/or dividend). A well-managed, profitable business will show a strong cash flow through the accounts’ plumbing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the accounting system is based on double entries. For every debit, there must be a credit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>cash-based accounting</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>transaction is recorded only when cash is physically or digitally received into the bank account, not when the service or product is provided or received.</li>\n<li>this might be alright for “mom and pop”-style businesses. Accounting laws do not allow larger companies to conduct cash-based accounting. This is because it represents a low and delayed way of tracking revenues and expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>accrual accounting</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>accrual accounting simply states that expenditures must be recorded when incurred and not when paid. Similarly, revenue must be recorded when services or goods outflow, not when the payment is realized.</li>\n<li>publicly traded companies are based on accrual accounting.</li>\n<li>although accrual accounting might count funds that haven’t been paid, it provides a more precise and realistic picture of the company’s performance - especially for stock investors. A great way to account for any inconsistencies caused by accrual accounting is by thoroughly understanding the cash flow statement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"income-statement-analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#income-statement-analysis\" aria-label=\"income statement analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Income statement analysis</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/income-statement-analysis-walkthrough/\">income statement analysis</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"./durable-competitive-financial-statements-analysis.xlsx\">old school value durable competitive advantage financial statement analysis</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the income statement’s sole purpose is to show a company’s profitability over a given period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>revenues from primary activities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>it’s revenue received for the sale of the company’s primary product or service</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>revenues from secondary activities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>such as interests from cash sitting in interest-bearing savings accounts producing revenue</li>\n<li>secondary activities are usually included in an income statement under the net interest income line.

That is also why gains and losses are sometimes referred to as extraordinary income (expense)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>expenses generated from primary activities</strong> are only expenses from producing operating revenues. This is listed on the income statement as “Cost of Revenue”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>expenses generated from secondary activities</strong>: if the business makes an expense and doesn’t directly relate to the materials or labour used to make the primary product, it’s considered an expense generated from secondary activities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>such as sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and other operating expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>expenses from financial activities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is disclosed as interest expenses, as they are not part of the daily business.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>losses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>a loss doesn’t relate directly to the primary activities of the company’s product or service, nor is it a part of daily operations. It is extraordinary. Graham would caution his students to pay close attention to extraordinary items and try to assess their impact on a business to manage and mitigate risk.</li>\n<li>a loss is also the result of a difference in the value an asset is listed for on the balance sheet and the proceeds received from the sale of that asset.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>revenue</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>this line is sometimes referred to as Sales or Turnover.</li>\n<li>revenue is simply the number of goods sold multiplied by the price of the product or service.</li>\n<li>As an informed investor, you might need more information regarding revenue generation - especially if the company has a deteriorating revenue stream. You could dig deeper into the 10K or 10Q, where you’ll find a net operating revenues section.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>cost of revenue</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka cost of sales, costs of goods sold and production costs</li>\n<li>It is the costs that are related to making the company’s primary product or service.</li>\n<li>the emphasis is placed on direct costs because these arise due to per-unit sales rather than any other cost driver.</li>\n<li>an investor must know the composition of the direct costs associated with the organization.</li>\n<li>the investor must pay close attention to the trends in the cost of revenue. If sales are constant and the cost of revenue continues to grow, a negative trend is developing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>gross profit</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka margin or markup</li>\n<li>gross profit is simply the revenue generated from core products and services less the direct costs associated with the production of goods or delivery of services.</li>\n<li>gross profit, in essence, is a measure of the organization’s efficiency - that is, the ability of the management to control its direct cost of revenue while simultaneously increasing sales.</li>\n<li>as an investor, you cannot compare the gross profit between 2 different industries. This often leads to misleading assumptions and doesn’t provide a relative framework to assess a company’s performance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>sales and marketing expense</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>sometimes, it is combined with Administration expenses and called SGA (selling, general and administration)</li>\n<li>advertisement is one of the greatest costs incurred by corporations today and is incorporated within the income statement. Moreover, you need to distribute your product to make it available to customers. This would lead to distribution costs, typically included in the sales and marketing expense line.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>research and development</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>cell phone companies, for example, must continuously innovate to remain competitive and therefore have high research and development costs</li>\n<li>conversely, companies such as Coca-cola do not have extensive research and development costs; this is because they already have a sustainable advantage through a product that has been sold for decades.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>general and administrative expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the labour cost related to the operation of its machines is directly associated with production and therefore is a part of the cost of revenue.</li>\n<li>the salary of white-collar managers involved in running the company is not attributed to the cost of production - instead, it is attributable to an overhead expense that’s rolled into the G&#x26;A (General and Administrative)</li>\n<li>corporations are likely to window-dress the general and administrative expenses shown in corporate income statements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>other operating expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>refer to all the overhead costs that cannot be categorized into the major lines the company has selected to represent, such as management salaries, depreciation, rent, marketing, advertising costs, costs for research into new products, operating leases and IT, etc… Think of it as a catchall category for any miscellaneous expense reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>operating expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>summation of all secondary expenses incurred in the business’s running.</li>\n<li>a summation of all the secondary expenses gives the investor an overview of how efficiently the company has allocated overhead costs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>income from operations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).</li>\n<li>compare this (income from operations) to the net interest income/expenses to gain an understanding of interest obligations (or debt payments).</li>\n<li>the basis of the organization is to produce goods and services to maximize profitability. Profitability will only be maximized when the business is able to control its operating expenses while maximizing its revenue. The operating income is an efficiency indicator, and the operating margin indicates the business’s ability to generate a profit from a given level of sales.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>net interest income/expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka financial items or other income/expenses</li>\n<li>the most appropriate name for this would be net interest income/expense since this line is most influenced by financing impacts</li>\n<li>interest expense is the cost of servicing debt incurred by the organization when it takes on debt.</li>\n<li>companies use debt as a financing source while keeping money in the bank to provide flexibility for their daily operations.</li>\n<li>the company would need to set up a sunk account (on the balance sheet) to set aside money each year to pay back the principal.</li>\n<li>remember that this line is not only financial items but also other revenue and expenses that are not part of the company’s daily operations. It could be income generated from other resources like renting out specific areas of the property. It could also relate to multinational companies with widespread operations that are likely to be impacted by foreign exchange risk adjustments in either a positive or negative manner</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>extraordinary income/expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>extraordinary is not part of the daily operations and cannot be predicted. For example, a loss incurred from a lawsuit is very hard to predict. It can be categorized as a one-time event or maybe restructuring charges like closing down a subsidiary, merging two divisions, or personnel receiving severance pay.</li>\n<li>When trying to determine a business’s true cash flow, many investors exclude extraordinary income in their model. That said, many conservative analysts will include average extraordinary expenses (for example, the average annual expense over five years)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>income taxes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>tax is a huge expense for any company, and just as you would instead invest in a company with an efficient R&#x26;D department, you would also rather invest in a company with a lower tax rate. You should look for the effective tax rate over time and not a single snapshot in time. The important thing is understanding a company’s tax trends. Look for consistencies - and when you don’t find them, understand why.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>net income</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka profit for the year or net income from continued operations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>gross profit margin ratio</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>gross profit margin ratio = gross profit / revenue</li>\n<li>indicate how efficient companies are at controlling costs and a good starting point to compare with a competitor</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>operating margin ratio</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>operating margin ratio = income from operations/revenue</li>\n<li>not only when the cost of revenue, such as sugar and tin cans, are sold, but secondary expenses like administration, distribution and all the other costs related to Coca-Cola’s daily business are deducted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>net income margin ratio</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>net income margin ratio = net income / revenue</li>\n<li>this is the money that the investors made in profit compared to the money the business collected for selling every product.</li>\n<li>trend analysis is the heart of understanding the prospects for future performance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>interest coverage ratio</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>important ratio for minimizing the risk and it shows the reality of a company’s ability to keep its head above water.</li>\n<li>interest coverage ratio = income from operations/interest expense</li>\n<li>as a rule of thumb, I like to see a stable interest coverage ratio of at least five times the operating income.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"cashflow-statement-analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#cashflow-statement-analysis\" aria-label=\"cashflow statement analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cashflow statement analysis</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/analysing-financial-statements-and-aerogrow/\">https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/analysing-financial-statements-and-aerogrow/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"./durable-competitive-financial-statements-analysis.xlsx\">old school value durable competitive advantage financial statement analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"cash-flow-from-operating-activities\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#cash-flow-from-operating-activities\" aria-label=\"cash flow from operating activities permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>cash flow from operating activities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>cash generated from operations reflects the ability of the organization to generate cash from its core business operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>our starting point for the cash flow from operating activities is the net income (the bottom line on the income statement).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>some line items within the income statement do not result in an inflow or outflow of cash and, therefore, must be added or deducted to the net income starting point of the cash flow statement</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the only cash flow representing a stable and predictable earnings capacity is obtained from operating activities.

However, it is highly unlikely a company will be caught manipulating unaudited reports.</li>\n<li>Only a small fraction of companies fraudulently distort their financial reports.</li>\n<li>Rapidly growing firms that suddenly face a slowdown may be tempted to cheat.</li>\n<li>Reporting bogus revenue can destroy a company’s reputation.</li>\n<li>A CEO fixated on making “the numbers” at any cost is an investor’s nightmare.</li>\n<li>Internal auditors should report directly to the Board of Directors’ audit committee.</li>\n<li>The SEC should have the authority to bar or suspend corporate executives and board members who become involved in fraudulent financial reporting.</li>\n<li><strong>when to be on the lookout</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>If a company operates in a weak oversight environment, with a closely held board of directors or without a competent, independent auditor, you have a reason for concern.</li>\n<li>If management faces excessive competitive pressure, that should draw your attention.</li>\n<li>If executives are known, for whatever reason, to be of dubious character or integrity, you have reason to wonder if that lack of integrity has crept over into other areas of the company’s business.</li>\n<li>If any of these indicators occurs in a previously high-flying company where growth is starting to slow, be especially wary and on the lookout.</li>\n<li>Also, be cautious about inner doings at basket-case companies struggling to stay alive.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>audit your auditor</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The auditors spend weeks reviewing a company’s financial records, so they spend some time reading their opinions. The opinion letter will usually give a clear view. That is, it will give the report a stamp of approval. If the auditors have severe reservations about the accuracy and fairness of a company’s financial statement, they will usually qualify the report. A company that receives a qualified opinion should raise the hackles on an investor’s back - especially if the qualification notes any “going concern.”</li>\n<li>Also, look out for a situation where no audit committee exists or the audit committee is comprised of less-than-independent members. The audit committee’s purpose is to act as a go-between, mediating between the outside auditor and the executives. Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange are required to have audit committees. No similar requirement binds most other publicly traded companies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>catching the crooks</strong>\nHow do you find out when a company is scamming you? Screening the integrity of financial reports is more accessible now, thanks to several Internet databases that equip you to check for signs of wrongdoing. Some sites focus more on the numbers, while others help you investigate a company’s footnotes, management discussions and news releases. The most widely used commercial database is Compustat, a product sold by Standard &#x26; Poor’s, a division of McGraw-Hill. Factset Corporation sells another database\n<ul>\n<li>With these tools, you can run a filter for companies showing the sharpest decline in operational cash flow as a percentage of net income. Or you can list companies that experienced the largest year-to-year sales growth followed by declining or negative growth. You can also seek the most significant increase in inventory compared to sales. Other things you can look for include an extensive deterioration in gross margins, a big jump in soft assets or a significant increase in deferred revenue</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>buying trouble</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Acquisitions are fertile ground for chicanery. Many companies seek to buy other companies to rapidly accelerate their growth, a strategy with many risks for investors. Several tricks related to acquisitions can be used to help cover up the underlying ill health of the purchasing company. These gimmicks include taking large write-offs before or after the acquisition, shifting losses from the deal to another period and releasing the reserves that may be created through large write-offs. Be concerned when a firm uses very aggressive acquisition behaviour in a way that might make its sales look better than they are</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>the lessons of Enron</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>One of the lessons of Enron is to be wary when a company makes a drastic change in how it does business. This is especially the case when a company is transitioning from an easily understood model, such as acquiring gas pipelines, to a model that is far more difficult to assess, such as trading on future energy contracts. Other warning signs included using special-purpose entities (SPEs), that is, off-the-books facilities that could be used to hide either profits or liabilities. Red flags should have been flapping because Enron did not provide detailed disclosure about the purpose of the SPEs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telling-tall-tales\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#telling-tall-tales\" aria-label=\"telling tall tales permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>telling tall tales</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Accounting’s two fraudulent strategies are to either inflate or deflate earnings.\n<ul>\n<li>The first can be accomplished by reporting an unduly considerable current period revenue or underestimating current period expenses. Manipulating either side of the ledger will work.</li>\n<li>The second, the less intuitive strategy, involves deflating or underestimating earnings. Why would anyone want to do that? If you underestimate your financial performance, you can shift payments to a later timeframe when you need them to cover shortfalls. Essentially you minimize current profits to inflate future profits, thereby making the company appear to perform better than it does</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Companies manipulate financial statements for three reasons:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It is easy</strong> – After all, managers check various options to select their firms’ accounting methods. Managers with integrity review the options available to find a reporting method that most closely reflects the company’s performance. Unscrupulous executives see the choices as an opportunity to take advantage of the system. Management is free to structure transactions or to announce reporting moves to promote the achievement of its accounting goals. For example, when using an operating lease approach, they can use lease agreements to keep debt off the books.</li>\n<li><strong>It can pay off handsomely</strong> – Bonuses are often tied to a company’s financial profiles, so managers have a vested interest.</li>\n<li><strong>The chances of getting caught are slim</strong> – Those who think they’ll get away with it are often correct. For instance, a company’s quarterly financial statements are unaudited and usually are not reviewed by an independent CPA. When an unaudited financial report is manipulated, it is doubtful that the company will be caught.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When evaluating the validity of a company’s reporting, be aware of misguided management incentives. These are not at all uncommon. Basing bonuses and stock options heavily on financial statement measurements create a temptation to cheat. Too much emphasis on the bottom line can cause observers to question the validity of a firm’s numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-seven-financial-shenanigans\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-seven-financial-shenanigans\" aria-label=\"the seven financial shenanigans permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>the seven financial shenanigans</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA) has defined 30 techniques, grouped into seven categories, that represent the ways that unethical companies dupe investors\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recording bogus revenue</strong> – This is the cardinal sin of accounting, and it can be accomplished in more ways than you might think. For example, some sales may appear to be significant, but they lack actual economic substance. Cash received in lending transactions can be recorded cleverly as revenue. Similarly, a company may try to record investment income as operating revenue. Another nasty trick is to count as revenue the rebates from suppliers that the company will receive on future purchases. And finally, a company may release revenue that it improperly held back in the first place, perhaps before a merger.</li>\n<li><strong>Recording poor-quality revenue</strong> – All revenue is not equal. For example, revenue for services that have not yet been provided is poor revenue and shouldn’t be counted. Revenue should never be recorded before the item sold has shipped and been accepted by the customer. A company should not record revenue if the customer isn’t required to pay. Sales to an affiliated company are also dubious. Grossing up revenue is another way to “cook the books.”</li>\n<li><strong>One-time gains</strong> – Occasionally, a company will sell assets or make an investment windfall and count that as revenue. The problem is that this is only a one-time gain. Similarly, a one-time payment can make operating expenses appear less. Another dirty little trick is reclassifying accounts on the balance sheet to create apparent income.</li>\n<li><strong>Failing to report future liabilities accurately</strong> – One way a company can put lipstick on the pig is to fail to record an obligation or otherwise move to reduce the list of liabilities improperly. Of course, owing less money makes a company look more profitable. This can be achieved by changing accounting assumptions, allowing reserves to be suddenly counted as income or creating phony rebates.</li>\n<li><strong>Expense-shifting</strong> – If you can stretch current expenses out so that they fall into a later reporting period, the results will appear to be better than they are. This includes reducing reserves, failing to write off impaired assets or taking too long to amortize expenses. Or, you could change accounting policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Income-shifting</strong> – Manipulation can also occur by shifting current revenue to a later period. This is sometimes achieved by creating a reserve account and then eliminating it later on when the money is needed. Also, companies occasionally hold back income before an acquisition deal closes.</li>\n<li><strong>Special charges</strong> – Even more subtle is the business of shifting future costs to the current period as a special charge. Inflating the amount of a particular charge, writing off R &#x26; D costs related to an acquisition and accelerating discretionary expenses are a few of the trade tricks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"fighting-shenanigans\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#fighting-shenanigans\" aria-label=\"fighting shenanigans permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>fighting shenanigans</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>So what can be done to ensure there is no Enron recurrence? Many parties must be involved in changing the way things work. Those who determine and interpret laws and set professional standards must establish clear parameters for proper financial accounting and reporting standards. Internal auditors should report directly to the audit committees of their boards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, set up after the stock market crash of 1929 to supervise the nature and accuracy of information provided to investors, should be given explicit legal authority to suspend or bar any corporate executive, director or board involved in financial misdealings. Management must set the proper tone and cannot emphasize reaching its numbers above everything else. Companies should be required to have auditors review their quarterly financial statements before they are released to the public. Auditors should be held more accountable for detecting fraud during an audit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In 1995, the SEC, the NASD and the NYSE combined to commission a study recommending ways to strengthen the audit committee function. The blue-ribbon panel determined that board directors must engage in active, independent oversight. The notion that a seat on a board is a reward for having “made it” in business should be replaced by an operational responsibility to guide the company forward. The audit committee has to be the main body responsible for driving the organization’s acceptance of proper accounting practices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perhaps financial shenanigans can never be eliminated. But specific steps can and must be taken to restore corporate credibility. Auditor training should emphasize the ability to detect accounting tricks and manipulations. Training should also be improved for those who rely on financial reports, including investors. The incentives to manipulate the numbers built into executive compensation packages should be re-evaluated. Investors, auditors and regulators have a much better chance of minimizing the damage that corporate dishonesty causes once they understand how dishonest companies pull off financial shenanigans.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>If you’re analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless</p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying.

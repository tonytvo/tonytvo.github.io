He starts at the source, where the water enters the main valve into the house (the net income), and he ends at the sink (the growing/decreasing equity and/or dividend). A well-managed profitable business will show a strong flow of cash through the plumbing of the accounts.</li>\n<li>the accounting system is based on double entries. For every debit, there must be a credit.</li>\n<li><strong>cash-based accounting</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>transaction is recorded only when cash is physically or digitally received into the bank account, not when the service or product is provided or received.</li>\n<li>this might be alright for “mom and pop”-style businesses, accounting laws do not allow for larger companies to conduct cash-based accounting. The reason for this is because it represents a low and delayed way of tracking revenues and expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>accrual accounting</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>accrual accounting simply states that expenditures must be recorded when incurred and not when paid. Similarly, revenue must recorded when there is an outflow of services or goods, not when the payment is realized.</li>\n<li>publicly traded companies are based on accrual accounting.</li>\n<li>although accrual accounting might count funds that haven’t actually been paid, it provides a clearer and realistic picture of the company’s performance - especially for stock investors. A great way to account for any inconsistencies caused from accrual accounting is by thoroughly understanding the cash flow statement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"income-statement-analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#income-statement-analysis\" aria-label=\"income statement analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Income statement analysis</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/income-statement-analysis-walkthrough/\">income statement analysis</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"./durable-competitive-financial-statements-analysis.xlsx\">old school value durable competitive advantage financial statement analysis</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the income statement’s sole purpose is to show a company’s profitability over a given period of time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>revenues from primary activities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>it’s revenue received for the sale of company’s primary product or service</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>revenues from secondary activities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>such as interests from cash sitting in an interest-bearing savings account produce revenue</li>\n<li>secondary activities are usually included in an income statement under the line titled net interest income. It is sometimes referred to as other income if it also includes other revenues not made from financial activities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>gains</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>such as gain (loss) on sale of assets</li>\n<li>it’s very important to understand that gains are not considered operating income. That is also why gains and losses are sometimes referred to as extraordinary income (expense)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>expenses generated from primary activities</strong> are only those expenses that occur from producing operating revenues. This is listed on the income statement as “Cost of Revenue”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>expenses generated from secondary activities</strong>: if an expense is made by the business and it doesn’t directly relate to the materials or labor used to make the primary product, it’s considered an expense generated from secondary activities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>such as sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, other operating expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>expenses from financial activities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is disclosed as interest expenses, as they are not part of the daily business.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>losses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>a loss doesn’t relate directly to the primary activities of the company’s product or service, nor is it a part of daily operations. It is extraordinary. Graham would caution his students to pay close attention to extraordinary items and try to assess their impact on a business, to mange and mitigate risk.</li>\n<li>a loss is also the result of a difference in the value an asset is listed for on the balance sheet and the proceeds received from the sale of that asset.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>revenue</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>this line is sometimes referred to as Sales or Turnover.</li>\n<li>revenue is simply the quantity of goods sold multiplied by the price of the product or service.</li>\n<li>As an informed investor, you might need more information regarding the generation of revenue - especially if the company has a deteriorating revenue stream. You could dig deeper into the 10K or 10Q, where you’ll find a section titled Net Operating Revenues.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>cost of revenue</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka cost of sales, costs of goods sold and production costs</li>\n<li>It is the costs that are related to making the company’s primary product or service.</li>\n<li>the emphasis is placed on the term direct costs; this is because these are costs that arise as a result of per unit sales rather than any other cost driver.</li>\n<li>an investor must have knowledge of the composition of the direct costs associated with the organization.</li>\n<li>the investor must pay close attention to the trends in the cost of revenue. If sales are constant and the cost of revenue continues to grow, a negative trend is developing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>gross profit</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka margin or markup</li>\n<li>gross profit is simply the revenue generated from core products and services less the direct costs associated with the production of goods or delivery of service.</li>\n<li>gross profit in essence is a measure of the organization’s efficiency - that is, the ability of the management to control its direct cost of revenue while simultaneously increasing sales.</li>\n<li>as an investor, you cannot compare the gross profit between 2 different industries. This often leads to misleading assumptions and doesn’t provide relative framework to assess a company’s performance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>sales and marketing expense</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>sometimes it combined with Administration expenses and called SGA (selling, general and administration)</li>\n<li>advertisement is one of the greatest costs incurred by corporations today and is incorporated within the income statement. Moreover, you need to distribute your product to make it available to customers. This would lead to distribution costs, which would typically also included in the sales and marketing expense line.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>research and development</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>cell phone companies, for example, must continuously innovate in order to remain competitive, and therefore have high research and development costs</li>\n<li>conversely, companies such as Coca-cola do not have extensive research and development costs; this is because they already have a sustainable advantage through a product that has been sold for decades.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>general and administrative expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the labor cost related to the operation of its machines is directly associated with production and therefore is a part of the cost of revenue.</li>\n<li>the salary of white-collar managers involved in running the company is not attributed to the cost of production - instead it attributable to an overhead expense that’s rolled into the G&#x26;A (General and Administrative)</li>\n<li>corporations are likely to window-dress the general and administrative expenses shown in corporate income statements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>other operating expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>refer to all the overhead costs that cannot be categorized into the major lines the company has selected to represent such as management salaries, depreciation, rent, marketing, advertising costs, costs for research into news products, operating leases and IT, etc… Think of it as a catchall category for any miscellaneous expense reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>operating expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>summation of all secondary expenses which are incurred in the running of the business.</li>\n<li>a summation of all the secondary expenses gives the investor an overview of how efficiently the company has allocated overhead costs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>income from operations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).</li>\n<li>compare this (income from operations) to the net interest income/expenses to gain an understanding of interest obligations (or debt payments).</li>\n<li>the basis of the organization is to produce goods and services in order to maximize profitability. Profitability will only be maximized when the business is able to control its operating expenses while maximizing its revenue. The operating income is in fact an indicator of efficiency, and the operating margin indicates the business’s ability to generate a profit from a given level of sales.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>net interest income/expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka financial items or other income/expenses</li>\n<li>the most appropriate name for this would be net interest income/expense, since this line is most influenced by financing impacts</li>\n<li>interest expense is simply the cost of servicing debt that is incurred by the organization when it takes on debt.</li>\n<li>companies use debt as a financing source, while keeping money in the bank to provide flexibility for their daily operations.</li>\n<li>company would need to setup a sunk account (on the balance sheet) in order to set aside money each year to payback the principal.</li>\n<li>remember that this line is not only financial items; it is also other revenue and expenses that are not part of the company’s daily operations. It could be income generated from other resources like renting out certain area of property. It could also relate to multinational companies with widespread operations that are likely to be impacted by foreign exchange risk adjustments in an either positive or negative manner</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>extraordinary income/expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>extraordinary is something that is not part of the daily operations and cannot be predicted. For example, a loss incurred from a lawsuit is very hard to predict and can be categorized as one-time event, or maybe restructuring charges like closing down subsidiary, merge 2 divisions, personnel receiving severance pay.</li>\n<li>when you’re trying to determine the true cash flow of a business, many investors exclude extraordinary income in their model. That said, many conservative analysts will include average extraordinary expenses (for example, the average annual expense over a five-year period)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>income taxes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>tax is huge expense for any company, and just as you would rather invest in a company with an efficient R&#x26;D department, you would also rather invest in a company with a lower tax rate. You should look for the effective tax rate over time, and not a single snapshot in time. The important thing is understanding a company’s tax trends. Look for consistencies - and when you don’t find them, understand why.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>net income</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka profit for the year or net income from continued operations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>gross profit margin ratio</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>gross profit margin ratio = gross profit / revenue</li>\n<li>indicate how efficient companies are at controlling the costs and a good starting point to compare with a competitor</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>operating margin ratio</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>operating margin ratio = income from operations / revenue</li>\n<li>not only when the cost of revenue such as sugar and tin cans are sold, but also secondary expenses like administration, distribution and all the other costs related to Coca-Cola’s daily business are deducted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>net income margin ratio</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>net income margin ratio = net income / revenue</li>\n<li>this is the money that the investors made in profit compared to money the business collected for the sale of every product.</li>\n<li>trend analysis is the heart of understanding the prospects for future performance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>interest coverage ratio</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>important ratio for minimizing the risk and it shows the reality of a company’s ability to keep its head above water.</li>\n<li>interest coverage ratio = income from operations / interest expense</li>\n<li>as a rule of thumb, I like to see a stable interest coverage ratio of at least 5 times the operating income.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"cashflow-statement-analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#cashflow-statement-analysis\" aria-label=\"cashflow statement analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cashflow statement analysis</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/analysing-financial-statements-and-aerogrow/\">https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/analysing-financial-statements-and-aerogrow/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"./durable-competitive-financial-statements-analysis.xlsx\">old school value durable competitive advantage financial statement analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"balance-sheet-statement-analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#balance-sheet-statement-analysis\" aria-label=\"balance sheet statement analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>balance sheet statement analysis</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/analyzing-financial-statements-circuit-city-balance-sheet/\">https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/analyzing-financial-statements-circuit-city-balance-sheet/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"./durable-competitive-financial-statements-analysis.xlsx\">old school value durable competitive advantage financial statement analysis</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>balance sheet is sectionalized into 3 major categories: the assets, the equity and the liabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>assets</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>assets are what the company owns</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>assets can ben financed in 2 ways: with the company’s money - this is called equity or with someone else’s money - this is called liabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>because assets are either financed by equity or liabilities, the 2 sides will always be equal. They will balance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>assets are something that is owned and expected to generate income for the company</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>2 different categories of assets: the non-current and the current assets</p>\n<ul>\n<li>current asset can be defined as any asset which is likely to be converted into cash within a period of 1 year such as cash, inventory and receivables</li>\n<li>non-current assets are sometimes referred to as long-term assets. An organization simply includes those assets that have an expected ownership over a period exceeding 1 year and cannot immediately be converted into cash such as machines for production, buildings, cards, etc…</li>\n<li>the idea distinguishing various kinds of assets is to present to the reader a true and fair view of a company’s financial condition that is also why the balance sheet is sometimes referred to as the statement of financial position.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>cash and cash equivalents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. When we think of cash, it includes any cash kept in a register and cash that is safely stored away in a bank account.</li>\n<li>cash equivalents are equal to having cash that is currently in a different form, for example, money market funds, saving deposits and deposit certificates.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>accounts receivables</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>aka receivables, net receivables.</li>\n<li>most of a business’s sales tend to be carried out on credit as opposed to cash. This payment in effect an asset for the company because it will be turned into cash at a later date. Typically, this would happen within 60-90 days. This also means that receivables, in reality are an interest-free loan provided from one company to another company.</li>\n<li>most often, it made up by the credit sales of goods and services,but it can also contain expected current payments such as interest on various securities.</li>\n<li>in short, this is money that is expected to flow into the company but is yet to be received.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>inventory</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>typically inventory is subdivided into 3 categories: raw materials (such as sugar for coca-cola), work in progress (such as labor costs for managing machines), and finished goods (includes costs for packaging the products).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>other current assets</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>any current assets that do not meet any of the 3 previous categories (may include property, plant and equipment available for sale, or any asset that is expected to be sold within the year)</li>\n<li>might also include derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments such as foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts (to minimize their risk and exposure to a flexible and unpredictable market).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>prepaid expenses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>a firm sometimes pays off some of its expenses before it actually incurs them (such as distribution rights in advance for 6 months in the case of coca-cola)</li>\n<li>the prepaid expenses tend to be the most iliquid item in the current assets category.

The opinion letter will usually give a clean view, that is, it will give the report a stamp of approval. If the auditors have a serious reservation about the accuracy and fairness of a company’s financial statement, however, they will usually qualify the report. A company that receives a qualified opinion should raise the hackles on an investor’s back - especially if the qualification notes any “going concern.”</li>\n<li>Also look out for a situation where no audit committee exists, or the audit committee is comprised of less-than-independent members. The purpose of the audit committee is to act as a go-between, mediating between the outside auditor and the executives. Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange are required to have audit committees. No similar requirement binds most other publicly traded companies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>catching the crooks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>So how do you find out when a company is scamming you? Screening the veracity of financial reports is easier now, thanks to several Internet databases that equip you to check for signs of malfeasance. Some sites focus more on the numbers, others help you investigate a company’s footnotes, management discussions and news releases. The most widely used commercial database is Compustat, which is a product that is sold by Standard &#x26; Poor’s, a division of McGraw-Hill. Another database is sold by Factset Corporation</li>\n<li>With these tools, you can run a filter for companies showing the sharpest decline in operational cash flow, as a percentage of net income. Or you can list companies that experienced the largest year-to-year sales growth followed by declining or negative growth. You can also seek the biggest increase in inventory, compared to sales. Other things you can look for include a very large deterioration in gross margins, a big jump in soft assets or a large increase in deferred revenue</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>buying trouble</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Acquisitions are fertile ground for chicanery. Many companies seek to buy other companies in order to rapidly accelerate their own growth, a strategy with many risks for investors. Several tricks that relate to acquisitions can be used to help cover up the underlying ill health of the purchasing company. These gimmicks include taking large write-offs before or after the acquisition, shifting loses from the deal to another time period and releasing the reserves that may be created through large write-offs. Be concerned when a firm uses very aggressive acquisition behavior in a way that might make its sales look better than they really are</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>the lessons of enron</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>One of the lessons of Enron is to be wary when a company makes a drastic change in how it does business. This is especially the case when a company is making a transition from an easily understood model, such as acquiring gas pipelines, to a model that is far more difficult to assess, such as trading on future energy contracts. Other warning signs included the use of special-purpose entities (SPEs), that is, off the books facilities that could be used to hide either profits or liabilities. Red flags should have been flapping because Enron did not provide detailed disclosure about the purpose of the SPEs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telling-tall-tales\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#telling-tall-tales\" aria-label=\"telling tall tales permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>telling tall tales</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Accounting’s two fraudulent strategies are to either inflate or deflate earnings.\n<ul>\n<li>The first can be accomplished by reporting an unduly large current period revenue, or by underestimating current period expenses. Manipulating either side of the ledger will work.</li>\n<li>The second, less intuitive strategy involves deflating or underestimating earnings. Why would anyone want to do that? Well, if you underestimate your financial performance, you can shift earnings to a later timeframe when you need them to cover shortfalls. Essentially you minimize current profits in order to inflate future profits, thereby making the company appear to perform better than it actually does</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Companies manipulate financial statements for three reasons:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It is easy</strong> – After all, managers themselves check a variety of options to select the accounting methods their firms will use. Managers with integrity review the options available to find a reporting method that most closely reflects the company’s performance. Unscrupulous executives, however, see the choices as an opportunity to take advantage of the system. Management is free to structure transactions or to announce reporting moves to promote the achievement of its accounting goals. For example, when using an operating lease approach, they can use lease agreements to keep debt off the books.</li>\n<li><strong>It can pay off handsomely</strong> – Bonuses are often tied to a company’s financial profiles, so managers have a vested interest.</li>\n<li><strong>The chances of getting caught are slim</strong> – Those who think they’ll get away with it are often right. For instance, a company’s quarterly financial statements are unaudited and, usually, are not reviewed by an independent CPA. When an unaudited financial report is manipulated, it is highly unlikely that the company will be caught.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When you evaluate the validity of a company’s reporting, be aware of any misguided management incentives. These are not at all uncommon. Basing bonuses and stock options heavily on financial statement measurements create a temptation to cheat. Too much emphasis on the bottom line can cause observers to question the validity of a firm’s numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-seven-financial-shenanigans\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-seven-financial-shenanigans\" aria-label=\"the seven financial shenanigans permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>the seven financial shenanigans</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA) has defined 30 techniques, grouped into seven categories, that represent the ways that unethical companies dupe investors\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recording bogus revenue</strong> – This is the cardinal sin of accounting, and it can be accomplished in more ways than you might think. For example, some sales may appear to be significant, but they lack actual economic substance. Cash received in lending transactions can be recorded cleverly as revenue. Similarly, a company may try to record investment income as operating revenue. Another nasty trick is to count as revenue the rebates from suppliers that the company will receive on future purchases. And, finally, a company may release revenue that it improperly held back in the first place, perhaps prior to a merger.</li>\n<li><strong>Recording poor-quality revenue</strong> – All revenue is not equal. Revenue for services that have not yet been provided, for example, is poor revenue and shouldn’t be counted. Revenue should never be recorded before the item being sold has actually shipped and been accepted by the customer. A company should not record revenue if the customer isn’t required to pay. Sales to an affiliated company are also dubious. Grossing up revenue is another way to “cook the books.”</li>\n<li><strong>One-time gains</strong> – Occasionally a company will sell assets or make an investment windfall, and count that as revenue. The problem is that this is really only a one-time gain. Similarly, a one-time gain can be used to make operating expenses appear less than they really are. Another dirty little trick is reclassifying accounts on the balance sheet in a way that creates apparent income.</li>\n<li><strong>Failing to report future liabilities accurately</strong> – One way a company can put lipstick on the pig is to fail to record an obligation, or otherwise move to reduce the list of liabilities improperly. Of course, owing less money makes a company look more profitable. This can be achieved by changing accounting assumptions, allowing reserves to be suddenly counted as income or creating phony rebates.</li>\n<li><strong>Expense-shifting</strong> – If you can stretch current expenses out so that they actually fall into a later reporting period, the results will appear to be better than they actually are. This includes reducing reserves, failing to write off impaired assets or taking too long to amortize expenses. Or, you could simply change accounting policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Income-shifting</strong> – Manipulation can also occur by way of shifting current revenue to a later period. This is sometimes achieved by creating a reserve account, and then eliminating it later on when the money is needed. Also be aware that companies occasionally hold back income before an acquisition deal closes.</li>\n<li><strong>Special charges</strong> – Even more subtle is the business of shifting future costs to the current period, as a special charge. Inflating the amount of a special charge, writing off R &#x26; D costs related to an acquisition and accelerating discretionary expenses are a few of the tricks of the trade.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"fighting-shenanigans\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#fighting-shenanigans\" aria-label=\"fighting shenanigans permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>fighting shenanigans</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>So what can be done to make sure there is no recurrence of Enron? Many parties must be involved in changing the way things work. Those who determine and interpret laws, and set professionals standards must establish clear parameters on proper financial accounting and reporting standards. Internal auditors should report directly to the audit committees of their boards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, set up after the stock market crash of 1929 to supervise the nature and accuracy of information provided to investors, should be given explicit legal authority to suspend or bar any corporate executive, director or board involved in financial misdealings. Management must set the proper tone and cannot emphasize reaching its numbers above everything else. Companies should be required to have auditors review their quarterly financial statements before they are released to the public. Auditors should be held more accountable for detecting fraud during an audit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In 1995, the SEC, the NASD and the NYSE combined forces to commission a study recommending ways to strengthen the audit committee function. The blue-ribbon panel determined that boards of directors have to engage in active, independent oversight. The notion that a seat on a board is a reward for having “made it” in business should be replaced by an active responsibility to guide the company forward. The audit committee has to be the main body that is responsible for driving the acceptance of proper accounting practices within the organization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perhaps financial shenanigans can never be completely eliminated. But certain steps can and must be taken to restore corporate credibility. Auditor training should place greater emphasis on the ability to detect accounting tricks and manipulations. Training should also be improved for those who rely on financial reports, including investors. The incentives to manipulate the numbers that are built into executive compensation packages should be re-evaluated. Investors, auditors and regulators have a much better chance of minimizing the damage that corporate dishonesty causes once they gain a better understanding of how dishonest companies pull off financial shenanigans.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>If you’re analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless</p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying.

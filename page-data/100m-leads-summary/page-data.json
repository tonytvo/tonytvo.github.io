You should avoid choosing a bad market. Instead, you can pick a great market with demand by looking at four indicators:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Massive Pain</strong>: Your prospects must have a desperate need, not want, for your offer.</li>\n<li><strong>Purchasing Power</strong>: Your prospects must afford or access the money needed to buy.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy to Target</strong>: Your audience should be in easy-to-target markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Growing</strong>: The market should be growing to make things move faster.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>First, start with the three primary markets resembling the core human pains: Health, Wealth, and Relationships. Then, find a subgroup in one of these larger markets that is growing, has the buying power, and is easy to target. Ultimately, picking a great market matters much more than your offer strength and persuasion skill:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Starving Crowd (market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Next, you need to commit to a niche until you have found a great offer. The niches will make you more money as you can charge more for a similar product. In the process of committing, you will try out many offers and failures. Therefore, you must be resilient, as you will eventually succeed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you find a crazy niche market, take advantage of it. And if you can pair the wealthy niche with a Grand Slam Offer, it will be so good that you probably never need to work again.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"pricing-charge-what-its-worth\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#pricing-charge-what-its-worth\" aria-label=\"pricing charge what its worth permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Pricing: Charge What It’s Worth</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Alex Hormozi advocates that you charge a premium as it allows you to do things no one else can to make your clients successful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Warren Buffet has said, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” Thus, people buy to get a deal for what they are getting (value) is worth more than what they are giving in exchange for it (price).” When someone perceives the value dipping lower than the price, they stop buying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid lowering prices to improve the price-value gap because you will fall into a vicious cycle of losing money, and your business will struggle. Instead, you want to improve the gap by raising your price after sufficiently increasing the value to the customer. As a result, the virtuous cycle works for you, and your business profits significantly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"./virtuous-vs-vicious-cycle-or-price.jpeg\">Virtuous vs. Vicious Cycle of Price</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Further, you must have clients fully committed by offering a service where they must pay high enough and take 10X action required to achieve results or solve issues.

Most entrepreneurs think that charging a lot is wrong, but you should “charge as much money for your products or services as humanly possible.” However, never charge more than what they are worth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You must understand the details of value to charge the most for your goods and services. Further, you should price them much more than the cost of fulfillment. The Value Equation quantifies the four variables that create the absolute best delivery methods of value for any offer:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"./value-equation.jpeg\">The four variables that create the value for $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Value is based on the perception of reality. Thus, your prospect must perceive the first two factors increasing and the second two factors decreasing to perceive value in their mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Dream Outcome</strong> (Goal: Increase) – “the expression of the feelings and experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind; the gap between their current reality and their dreams”</li>\n<li><strong>Perceived Likelihood of Achievement</strong> (Goal: Increase) – the probability that the purchase will work and achieve the result that the prospect is looking for</li>\n<li><strong>Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement</strong> (Goal: Decrease) – “the time between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit;” this driver consists of long-term outcome and short-term experience</li>\n<li><strong>Perceived Effort &#x26; Sacrifice</strong> (Goal: Decrease) – “the ancillary costs or other costs accrued” of effort and sacrifice; supports why “done for you services” are almost always more expensive than “do-it-yourself”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-thought-process\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-thought-process\" aria-label=\"the thought process permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Thought Process</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>difference between convergent and divergent problem solving:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Convergent</strong> – problem solving where there are many known variables with unchanging conditions to converge on a singular answer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Divergent</strong> – problem solving in which there are many solutions to a singular problem with known variables, unknown variables, and dynamic conditions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Set a timer for 2 minutes and “write down as many different uses of a brick as you can possibly think of.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This exercise illustrates that “every offer has building blocks, the pieces that when combined make an offer irresistible.” You need to use divergent thinking to determine how to combine the elements to provide value.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"creating-your-grand-slam-offer-part-i-problems--solutions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#creating-your-grand-slam-offer-part-i-problems--solutions\" aria-label=\"creating your grand slam offer part i problems  solutions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Creating Your Grand Slam Offer Part I: Problems &#x26; Solutions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>how to craft the problems and solutions of your Grand Slam Offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome:</strong> When thinking about the dream outcome, you need to determine what your customer experiences when they arrive at the destination.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step #2: List the Obstacles Encountered:</strong> Think of all the problems that prevent them from achieving their outcome or continually reaching it.

Specifically, you need to understand trimming and stacking by reframing with the concept of the sales to fulfillment continuum:</p>\n<p>Sales to Fulfillment Continuum – “a continuum between ease of fulfillment and ease of sales” to find the sweet spot of selling something well that is easy to fulfill:</p>\n<p>The Sale to Fulfillment Continuum\nThe goal is “to find a sweet spot where you sell something very well that’s also easy to fulfill.”</p>\n<p>Alex Hormozi lives by the mantra, “Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction:”</p>\n<p>Create Flow: Generate demand first to validate that what you have is good.\nMonetize Flow: Get the prospect to say yes to your offer.\nAdd Friction: Create friction in the marketing or reduce the offer for the same price.\n“If this is your first Grand Slam Offer, it’s important to over-deliver like crazy,” which generates cash flow. Then, invest the cash flow to create systems and optimize processes to improve efficiency. As a result, your offer may not change, but rather the newly implemented systems will provide the same value to clients for significantly fewer resources.</p>\n<p>Finally, here are the last steps of creating the Grand Slam offer:</p>\n<p>Step #4: Create Your Solutions Delivery Vehicles (“The How”): Think through every possibility to solve each identified issue in exchange for money. There are several product delivery “cheat codes” for product variation or enhancement:</p>\n<p>Attention: What level of personal attention do I want to provide?\nOne-on-one – private and personalized\nSmall group – intimate, small audience but not private\nOne to many – large audience and not private\nEffort: What level of effort is expected from them?\nDo it Yourself (DIY) – the business helps the customer figure it out on their own\nDone with You (DWY) – the business coaches the customer on how to do it\nDone for You (DFY) – the company does it for the customer\nSupport: If doing something live, what setting or medium do I want to deliver it in?\nIn-person or support via phone, email, text, Zoom, chat, etc.\nConsumption: If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it?\nAudio, Video, or Written materials.\nSpeed &#x26; Convenience: How quickly do we want to reply? On what days and hours?\nAll-day (24/7), Workday (9-5), Time frame (within 5 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day)\n10x Test: What would I provide if my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000)?\n1/10th Test: How can I ensure a successful outcome if they paid me 1/10th of the price?\nStep #5a: Trim Down the Possibilities: From your huge list of possibilities, determine those that provide the highest value to the customer while having the lowest cost to the business.

Naval Ravikant has said that “Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want,” as it follows that:</p>\n<p>“People want what they can’t have. People want what other people want. People want things only a select few have access to.”</p>\n<p>Essentially, all marketing exists to influence the supply and demand curve:</p>\n<p>Alex Hormozi’s new Supply and Demand Curve in $100M Offers\nTherefore, you can enhance your core offer by doing the following:</p>\n<p>Increase demand or desire with persuasive communication\nDecrease or delay satisfying the desires by selling fewer units\nIf you provide zero supply or desire, you will not make money and repel people. But, conversely, if you satisfy all the demands, you will kill your golden goose and eventually not make money.</p>\n<p>The result is engaging in a “Delicate Dance of Desire” between supply and demand to “sell the same products for more money than you otherwise could, and in higher volumes, than you otherwise would (over a longer time horizon).”</p>\n<p>Until now, the book has focused on the internal aspects of the offer. For more on marketing, check out the book, The 1-Page Marketing Plan (book summary) by Allan Dib. The following chapters discuss the outside factors that position the product in your prospect’s mind, including scarcity, urgency, bonuses, guarantees, and naming.</p>\n<h1 id=\"scarcity\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#scarcity\" aria-label=\"scarcity permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Scarcity</h1>\n<p>In a transaction, “the person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand.” In Chapter 12 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you how to “use scarcity to decrease supply to raise prices (and indirectly increase demand through perceived exclusiveness):”</p>\n<p>Scarcity – the “fear of missing out” or the psychological lever of limiting the “supply or quantity of products or services that are available for purchase”</p>\n<p>Scarcity works as the “fear of loss is stronger than the desire for gain.” Therefore, so you can influence prospects to take action and purchase your offer with the following types of scarcity:</p>\n<p>Limited Supply of Seats/Slots\nLimited Supply of Bonuses\nNever Available Again\nPhysical Goods: Produce limited releases of flavors, colors, designs, sizes, etc. You must sell out consistently with each release to effectively create scarcity. Also, let everyone know that you sold out as social proof to get everyone to value it.</p>\n<p>Services: Limit the number of clients to cap capacity or create cadence:</p>\n<p>Total Business Cap – “only accepting X clients at this level of service (on-going)”\nGrowth Rate Cap – “only accepting X clients per time period (on-going)”\nCohort Cap – “only accepting X clients per class or cohort”\nHonesty: The most ethical and easiest scarcity strategy is honesty.

Then, offer the bonuses to grow the discrepancy such that it becomes irresistible and compels the prospect to buy. Additionally, there are a few keys when offering bonuses:</p>\n<p>Always offer them a bonus.\nGive each bonus a unique name with the benefit contained in the title.\nTell them (a) how it relates to their issue; (b) what it is; (c) how you discovered it or created it; and (d) how it explicitly improves their lives or provides value.\nProve that each bonus provides value using stats, case studies, or personal anecdotes.\nPaint a vivid mental picture of their future life and the benefits of using the bonus.\nAssign a price to each bonus and justify it.\nProvide tools and checklists rather than additional training as they are more valuable.\nEach bonus should address a specific concern or obstacle in the prospect’s mind.\nBonuses can solve a next or future problem before the prospect even encounters it.\nEnsure that each bonus expands the price to value discrepancy of the entire offer.\nEnhance bonus value by adding scarcity and urgency to the bonus themselves.\nFurther, you can partner with other businesses to provide you with their high-value goods and services as a part of your bonuses.” In exchange, they will get exposure to your clients for free or provide you with additional revenue from affiliate marketing.</p>\n<h1 id=\"guarantees\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#guarantees\" aria-label=\"guarantees permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Guarantees</h1>\n<p>The most significant objection to any sale of a good or service is the risk that it will not work for a prospect. In Chapter 15 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you how to “use guarantees to increase demand by reversing risk:”</p>\n<p>Guarantee – “a formal assurance or promise, especially that certain conditions shall be fulfilled relating to a product, service, or transaction”</p>\n<p>Your guarantee gets power by telling the prospect what you will do if they do not get the promised result in this conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z.” There are four types of guarantees:</p>\n<p>Unconditional – the strongest guarantee that allows customers to pay to try the product or service to see if they like it and get a refund if they don’t like it\n“No Questions Asked” Refund – simple but risky as it holds you accountable\nSatisfaction-Based Refund – triggers when a prospect is unsatisfied with service\nConditional – a guarantee with “terms and conditions;” can incorporate the key actions someone needs to take to get the successful outcome\nOutsized Refund – additional money back attached to doing the work to qualify\nService – provide work that is free of charge until X result is achieved\nModified Service – grant another period Y of service or access free of charge\nCredit-Based – provide a refund in the form of a credit toward your other offers\nPersonal Service – work with client one-on-one for free until X result is achieved\nHotel + Airfare Perks – reimburse your product with hotel and airfare if no value\nWage-Payment – pay their hourly rate if they don’t get value from your session\nRelease of Service – cancel the contract free of charge if they stop getting value\nDelayed Second Payment – stop 2nd payment until the first outcome is reached\nFirst Outcome – pay ancillary costs until they reach their first outcome\nAnti-Guarantee – a non-guarantee that explicitly states “all sales are final” with a creative reason for why\nImplied Guarantees – a performance-based offer based on trust and transparency\nPerformance – pay $X per sale, show, or milestone\nRevenue-Share – pay X% of top-line revenue or X% of revenue growth\nProfit-Share – pay X% of profit or X% of Gross Profit\nRatchets – pay X% if over Y revenue or profit\nBonuses/Triggers – pay X when Y event occurs\nHormozi prefers “selling service-based guarantees or setting up performance partnerships.” Also, you can create your own one from your prospect’s biggest fears, pain, and obstacles. Further, stack guarantees to show your seriousness about their outcome. Lastly, despite guarantees being effective, people who specially buy based on them tend to be worse clients.</p>\n<h1 id=\"naming\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#naming\" aria-label=\"naming permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Naming</h1>\n<p>“Over time, offers fatigue; and in local markets, they fatigue even faster.” In Chapter 16 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you how to “use names to re-stimulate demand and expand awareness of your offer to your target audience.”</p>\n<p>“We must appropriately name our offer to attract the right avatar to our business.” You can rename your offer to get leads repeatedly using the five parts of the MAGIC formula:</p>\n<p>Make a Magnetic Reason Why: Start with a word or phrase that provides a strong reason for running the promotion or presentation.\nAnnounce Your Avatar: Broadcast specifically “who you are looking for and who you are not looking for as a client.”\nGive Them a Goal: Elaborate upon the dream outcome for your prospect to achieve.\nIndicate a Time Interval: Specify the expected period for the client to achieve their dream results.\nComplete with a Container Word: Wrap up the offer as “a bundle of lots of things put together” with a container word.\nNote that you only need to use three to five components in naming your product or service.

Where’s the credibility?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m not really sure where the ideas or principles in the scrolls came from – whether some guy just sat down and wrote out what he thought would bring success or whether there was some study or experience.  I don’t take anything at face value.  Maybe it’s the lawyer in me, but I want to see the proof, where the ideas came from, whether I can rely on them.  At first this seemed like just some collection of random, arbitrary “good ideas” with no backing whatsoever.  The fact that some “fictional” character found success with these principles is not enough for me.  I really want some real-life proof that these ideas really work.  I didn’t get that in the book.  Not to say that the principles don’t work, but there is no evidence either way.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why the parable?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The parable seems to illustrate how to come into possession of secrets of success rather than to illustrate the principles themselves. That is to say, the parable is entertaining rather than instructing.  The story was distracting in many parts, and contained many unnecessary elements.  I have seen some personal development works masterfully use story to deliver principles through story that helps the reader comprehend and internalize the concepts.  The 4 Laws of Financial Prosperity is a good example of this.  This story not only takes place at the time of Christ, the main character (Spoiler Alert here) comes into contact with Him.  Although this is a nice thought for those of us who love Christ, it merely distracts from the purpose of the work, in my opinion.  At least it did for me.  If there were some example of application of each principle into the life of the main character in a way that we could see it in action, that would have been a much better application of a story.  Here is was just a fore and after thought.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Innocence: “Just Believe” seems to be the main force behind the principles and concepts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This reminds me of many of the personal development works in the early 1900’s.  There are many more sophisticated and reliable methods of achieving personal development that will leave you less frustrated with your results.  For example, the book’s main form of achieving change is reliance on repeating phrases over and over.  I respect affirmations, declarations, and visualizations, but to repeat archaic text ad nausuem doesn’t seem to be the best format.  However, I readily admit that it is much better than doing nothing, so… it works.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>where’s misdirection?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There were a few ideas throughout the book that I don’t know if I agree with having read personal development books my whole life.  One idea is the rejecting of failure.  The truth is that we are not perfect, and we would be better off learning from and living with failure than running from or trying to avoid failure at all costs.  This is, of course, my opinion.  However, I note that the story has many things good to say about failure that I wholeheartedly agree with and support.  Another example of a concept that didn’t sit right with me was rejection of idleness, which some might take to the extreme and refuse to rest or relax.  Furthermore, I believe prayer should include more than just asking for “guidance” you may ask for outright blessings, too.  Which the 10th scroll does ultimately do.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>is there secret Answers?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s not said, but the book presents to the mind that principles of success are hidden and secret and that only a few of the very rich and successful know them, that they keep them to themselves.  I strongly disagree with this.  In fact, principles of success is all around us.  Success leaves clues, and we can ask anyone who is successful to share with us their philosophy, and they readily will.  It is an unfortunate myth that there are “Secrets of Success” because there are no secrets.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“People who help others (with zero expectation) experience higher levels of fulfillment, live longer, and make more money.” And so, “if you introduce something valuable to someone, they associate that value with you.”</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://theprocesshacker.com/blog/100m-offers-alex-hormozi-summary/\">https://theprocesshacker.com/blog/100m-offers-alex-hormozi-summary/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wisewords.blog/book-summaries/100m-offers-book-summary/\">https://wisewords.blog/book-summaries/100m-offers-book-summary/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://auresnotes.com/summary-100m-offers-alex-hormozi/\">https://auresnotes.com/summary-100m-offers-alex-hormozi/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thepowermoves.com/100-million-offers-summary-review/\">https://thepowermoves.com/100-million-offers-summary-review/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://salesblink.io/blog/the-greatest-salesman-in-the-world-book-summary\">https://salesblink.io/blog/the-greatest-salesman-in-the-world-book-summary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://benbalden.com/the-greatest-salesman/\">https://benbalden.com/the-greatest-salesman/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.efficy.com/the-greatest-salesman-in-the-world/\">https://www.efficy.com/the-greatest-salesman-in-the-world/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bestbookbits.com/the-greatest-salesman-in-the-world-by-og-mandino/\">https://bestbookbits.com/the-greatest-salesman-in-the-world-by-og-mandino/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://growthabit.com/the-greatest-salesman-in-the-world-book-summary-review-notes/\">https://growthabit.com/the-greatest-salesman-in-the-world-book-summary-review-notes/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"100M dollar leads by Alex Hormozi summary wip","date":"December 11, 2023","description":"100M dollar leads by Alex Hormozi summary"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/5-love-language/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman summary"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/daily-dad-summary/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"daily dad by Ryan Holiday Summary"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4ab64577-8d20-58fe-b134-606b39667d07","previousPostId":"77e67d94-ed10-5de1-b2ca-2fcef0d72352","nextPostId":"77b1c09b-c121-53b0-a440-25a0df3d2e9a"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}

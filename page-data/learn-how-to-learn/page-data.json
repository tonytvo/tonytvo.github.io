Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital”</p>\n<p>“Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress”</p>\n<p>“I’m no genius, I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.”</p>\n<p>“any fool can know. The point is to understand”</p>\n<p>“it takes one to know one”</p>\n<p><strong>“the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you’re the easiest person to fool”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>True experts recognize the limits of what they know what what they do not know. If they find themselves outside of their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know”.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>“Skim a lot of books, read a few.

works in a focused and diffuse mode. Sometimes it’s focused and other times when it wanders. Both modes are necessary to learn effectively. You can be in only one mode at a time. You can change your brain through learning. Diffuse mode uses a different part of the brain than when you’re focused. You can make connections between ideas when your brain is in diffuse mode. When you’re focused, you make trails in your brain. When you first learn a subject, you lay trails in your brain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You follow the trail you laid for the subject when you are working on a problem.

It’s putting something off for later. When you put off something that’s important to your success, at first it doesn’t seem like it has much impact, but over time it can have a devastating effect. When you get accustomed to procrastinating, it makes doing important tasks harder. You get stressed and miss deadlines. You’ll also fall behind. Procrastination is bad for effective learning. You run out of time to focus on studying information. No time to focus on what you learned.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To stop procrastination, get going. Francesco Cirillo came up with the Pomodoro Technique. You can use the Pomodoro Technique to avoid procrastination and to focus. Time and practice work hand-in-hand. You learn more effectively. You need the time to practice what you’re learning. Procrastination robs you of time. When you have enough time, you can build learning structures. When you think about something you don’t like, it activates the insular cortex, which is the pain center of the brain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a great productivity system that helps keep your attention on task (25 minutes), and reminds you to take a break (5 minutes).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learning best happens when you rest deliberately. Using your phone during a break doesn’t help your brain recharge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A 2013 study showed that students who didn’t use their cellphones wrote better notes, recalled more, and scored a letter grade and a half higher than their phone-using counterparts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moving back and forth between different tasks (i.e. task-switching) can reduce focus/learning, and increase forgetting. However, task-switching can be useful for creative work, because it can prevent fixation and broaden your awareness.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For deeper focus, try keeping away from digital devices. If you can’t, make sure social media apps and notifications are turned off.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If interruptions are unavoidable, create a ready-to-resume plan. This can be as simple as noting where you left off while working on a math problem, so that you can return to it after. Having a plan provides closure for your brain and allows you to switch focus without being preoccupied. It will also help you return to your work more efficiently lat</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-unstuck\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#getting-unstuck\" aria-label=\"getting unstuck permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Getting Unstuck</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Napping and doing nothing are actually terrific ways to take a break. Getting a cup of tea or going for a short walk are also great.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Focused mode is when your attention is directed towards a single activity, like writing or drawing a picture. Diffuse mode is when your mind wanders, like while riding the bus or going for a walk, and is when you can come up with new insights and approaches. Alternating between the two modes is one of the best ways to learn new—and difficult—things.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can leverage the power of diffuse mode to make progress on difficult problems in the background. Try working on a hard problem before a meal, a break, or sleeping for the night.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The “hard start” technique can help you on tests. Spend a few minutes on the most challenging parts, and then switch to the easier problems. Your brain will continue tugging at the thread of the challenge parts behind the scenes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Diffuse mode is great for writing first drafts, while focused mode is better for editing. However, many people get caught up in editing as they go, which leads to trouble getting the first draft out of your head and onto the page. You can cover the screen while you write or use apps like Write or Die to overcome your tendency to self-edit and nitpick.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"deeper-learning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#deeper-learning\" aria-label=\"deeper learning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Deeper Learning</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>On a neurological level, learning is when new neurons connect to each other. The dendrites are like long legs that reach out and attach to other neurons through dendritic branches, which are like toes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each time you remember a set of information or engage a skill, old neural connections are activated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Active learning means pushing yourself and working your brain. Passive learning is when you scan a book or listen inattentively. To learn actively, it helps to retrieve the knowledge or skills you are using. This helps to build and reinforce new connections, and forces you to check your understanding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Retrieval practice gives you feedback about what you know well, and what you need to practice more. If you can’t pull it out of long-term memory and into short term memory, it isn’t likely to stick</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other ways to learn actively: think through problems on your own (without the answers), try to recall concepts and passages from what you read, come up with questions, explain and teach others, and use self-testing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Elaboration is when you explain a concept in your own words, whether it is to yourself or others. In a 1983 study, students who talked through problems as they worked on them scored much higher than students who didn’t. You can put the power of elaboration to work by verbalizing the chords you are playing while learning the piano, or explaining your methods at each step of a math problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interleaving means varying the skills or knowledge you acquire during a practice session. An example in baseball would be practicing with a combination of different types of pitches(like change-ups, curve balls, and sliders) in one session, instead of just with one type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exercise increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

Your declarative system functions alongside your working memory when you practice a new skill. You procedural system works when you internalize elements of a skill, and can use them reflexively. Both types of learning can occur side by side, and can reinforce each other.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While the declarative system operates step by step, the procedural system identifies patterns and works more intuitively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When learning a new language, it is important to activate your procedural system. While your declarative system is able to hold onto lots of words and information, it can take a long time to access them. When you learn a language procedurally, the vocabulary and speech comes more readily.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wherever possible, converse with a native speaker of the language. While you will make a lot of mistakes, they can help correct you and you can train your procedural system to internalize the patterns of speech in your target language.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gestures can also help you to anchor the meaning of new words.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author.

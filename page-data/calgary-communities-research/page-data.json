The area also has parks, community centers, and local shopping options​</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Housing age:</strong> Most houses in Ogden were built between 1912 and the mid-20th century, as it is one of Calgary’s older neighborhoods​</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Common building types:</strong> The housing stock in Ogden mainly consists of single-family homes, duplexes, and some townhouses. It’s a mix of older homes with some newer developments​</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Zoning regulations:</strong> Ogden has primarily residential zoning, allowing for both single-family and multi-family homes. Calgary has been updating zoning laws recently, potentially allowing for increased density and more units per lot in certain areas​</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Population and growth:</strong> The population of Ogden is around 8,000.

Older neighborhoods like Thorncliffe, Huntington Hills, and Brentwood provide affordable investment options with long-term growth potential.\nNewer communities: There was caution against investing in newer communities without established amenities. These areas are seen as long-term plays, where amenities are still being developed, but they may suffer from lower initial rental demand.</p>\n<p>Zoning and development: The forum emphasized the importance of understanding zoning changes and upcoming infrastructure projects (e.g., new CTrain routes) that can impact long-term investment value. Ogden, for example, is expected to see significant appreciation as zoning changes allow for more in-fill developments, and the CTrain extension improves accessibility.</p>\n<p>Rental trends: The forum noted that rental properties near key amenities like shopping, transit, and schools tend to perform better. They highlighted opportunities in townhouse and condo markets, especially in more affordable areas with high rental demand, such as Walden and Ogden.</p>\n<p>Long-term potential vs. current cash flow: Investors were encouraged to focus on long-term appreciation rather than just cash flow. Established communities in Calgary with solid infrastructure and accessibility (e.g., Midnapore, Huntington Hills, and Glenbrook) were recommended for steady growth over time.</p>\n<p>Neighborhood quality: Communities were categorized by potential for returns, with high-end neighborhoods like Aspen offering steady appreciation but higher entry points, while more affordable areas like Queensland and Thorncliffe showed greater short-term price jumps due to affordability-driven demand.</p>\n<p>Deep South\nMahogany, Walden, Copperfield, Cranson: High sales volumes and interest, driven by amenities like hospitals, parks, schools, and shopping centers. Accessibility via the Stoney Trail ring road boosts demand. Communities are desirable for both homebuyers and renters, with newer homes attracting young families.\nSouth Calgary\nMidnapore, Queensland, Ogden: Midnapore offers a lakeside community and good amenities. Queensland and Ogden are more affordable but have seen significant price appreciation, with rental demand increasing due to proximity to employment centers and the future CTrain line in Ogden, which is expected to push prices further.\nWest Calgary\nAspen, Springbank Hill, Glenbrook, Strathcona: These neighborhoods feature higher-end homes with substantial long-term appreciation potential. The west side is known for its proximity to quality schools, parks, and amenities like Westside Rec Centre. Aspen and Springbank Hill are high-cost areas but provide luxury and long-term gains. Glenbrook and Strathcona offer more affordable options with rental demand.\nNorthwest Calgary\nTuscany, Silver Springs, Ranchlands, Varsity: The northwest is characterized by easy access to transit and good amenities. Communities like Tuscany and Silver Springs have strong demand for both ownership and rentals. Older communities, including Ranchlands and Varsity, provide affordable homes with potential for renovation and solid returns.\nNorth Calgary\nThorncliffe, Beddington, Huntington Hills: These established neighborhoods are benefiting from affordability and future infrastructure, including the extension of the CTrain line. Thorncliffe in particular has larger lot sizes and is expected to see strong growth.\nNortheast Calgary\nWhitehorn, Rundle, Pineridge, Temple: Working-class communities close to transit and employment hubs like the airport. These areas offer affordable housing with strong rental demand, especially from families. Properties near the CTrain line are particularly desirable.\nSurrounding Towns\nCochrane, Airdrie, Chestermere: These towns are seeing increased demand from buyers looking for more affordable options outside Calgary. Rental demand is strong due to population growth and proximity to major employment centers like the airport and CrossIron Mills.\nHigh-End Neighborhoods\nMount Royal, Bel-Aire, Aspen Woods: These luxury neighborhoods have seen a decrease in sales volume due to higher interest rates but remain desirable for long-term investors and affluent homebuyers.</p>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bwalk.com/\">https://www.bwalk.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.rentfaster.ca/\">https://www.rentfaster.ca/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mycalgary.com/\">https://mycalgary.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.areavibes.com/\">https://www.areavibes.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zumper.com/\">https://www.zumper.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://calgary.ca\">https://calgary.ca</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"calgary communities research","date":"December 08, 2023","description":"calgary communities research"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/48-laws-power/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"48 laws of power by Robert Greene summary"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/5-love-language/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman summary"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2a1d2584-56c5-55fa-9d01-ca1531b31e55","previousPostId":"7ea09518-65a0-5445-81c1-dec254e0022b","nextPostId":"77e67d94-ed10-5de1-b2ca-2fcef0d72352"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}

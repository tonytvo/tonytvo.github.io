It’s a mix of older homes with some newer developments​</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Zoning regulations:</strong> Ogden has primarily residential zoning, allowing for both single-family and multi-family homes. Calgary has been updating zoning laws recently, potentially allowing for increased density and more units per lot in certain areas​</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Population and growth:</strong> The population of Ogden is around 8,000.

Mahogany Wetlands is a large natural reserve that promotes outdoor activities like hiking and birdwatching.</li>\n<li>Schools: Schools in the area include Divine Mercy Catholic School and Mahogany School, with more planned as the community grows.</li>\n<li>Transit: Mahogany is connected to downtown Calgary by major routes like Stoney Trail and Deerfoot Trail, and the community is serviced by Calgary Transit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When Were the Houses Commonly Built?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mahogany is one of Calgary’s newer communities, with homes mostly built from the mid-2000s to the present. Development in Mahogany continues, with more phases planned as the community expands.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Common Building Type</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mahogany offers a mix of single-family detached homes, semi-detached homes, townhouses, and condominiums. The community also features estate homes with lake access, and many new homes are designed with modern layouts and energy-efficient features.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Zoning Regulations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mahogany’s zoning includes a variety of residential designations, allowing for a range of housing options from single-family homes to multi-family developments. The zoning allows for higher-density housing in certain areas, including townhouses and apartment buildings. These zoning regulations support the development of both family homes and more affordable housing units, catering to a wide range of residents.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Population and Growth</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The population of Mahogany is currently around 10,000–12,000 people, but the community is expected to grow significantly as more phases are developed. Mahogany has seen rapid growth in recent years due to its appeal as a lake community with modern amenities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Average Income</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average household income in Mahogany is higher than the Calgary average, estimated at $100,000+. This reflects the community’s appeal to young professionals, families, and those purchasing new or estate homes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Crime Rate</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mahogany is considered a low-crime community. Being a newer and more affluent area, it tends to have lower levels of reported crime compared to older or inner-city neighborhoods in Calgary.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rental Supply and Demand</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mahogany has a moderate rental market due to its appeal to families and young professionals. However, as a relatively new and upscale community, most properties are owner-occupied. Rental demand tends to be for townhouses, semi-detached homes, and apartments due to affordability constraints on detached homes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Average Rents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One-bedroom apartment: $1,500–$1,800/month</li>\n<li>Two-bedroom apartment: $1,800–$2,200/month</li>\n<li>Three-bedroom house: $2,500–$3,200/month</li>\n<li>Given the community’s higher-end appeal, rent prices in Mahogany are on the higher side compared to other Calgary neighborhoods, especially for lake-access properties and estate homes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Neighborhood Classification (A, B, C, D)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mahogany is classified as an A neighborhood due to its premium amenities, new housing stock, and desirable lakefront lifestyle. It attracts higher-income residents and offers a mix of housing options for various demographics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Long-Term Potential Appreciation vs. Current Returns and Cashflow</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciation: Mahogany has strong long-term appreciation potential. As the community continues to grow and attract new residents, property values are expected to rise. The community’s appeal as a lakefront development and the ongoing construction of new homes contribute to this growth.</li>\n<li>Cashflow: While Mahogany offers good appreciation potential, cash flow may be limited due to the higher initial property prices. Investors may find better rental cash flow from multi-family units or townhouses, but single-family homes may offer slower rental income returns.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Average House Prices</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detached homes: $550,000–$1,200,000 (with lakefront estate homes at the higher end)</li>\n<li>Townhouses/duplexes: $350,000–$550,000</li>\n<li>Condos/apartments: $250,000–$400,000</li>\n<li>Mahogany’s home prices are on the higher end, reflecting its status as a desirable lake community.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Real Estate Investment Strategies</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy-and-Hold: Given the long-term appreciation potential, a buy-and-hold strategy could work well in Mahogany. Investors can hold onto properties for future value increases, particularly in single-family homes and estate properties.</li>\n<li>Infill Development: While most of Mahogany is still under development, the community’s zoning allows for higher-density housing in certain areas. Investors can focus on townhouses or multi-family units for better rental returns and future resale opportunities.</li>\n<li>Short-Term Rentals: Mahogany’s lake access and proximity to recreational areas make it appealing for short-term rentals (such as Airbnb), especially for visitors looking for a premium experience. This could be particularly effective during summer months when demand for lakefront properties peaks.</li>\n<li>Luxury Home Investment: Mahogany is known for its estate homes with private lake access. Investors could consider high-end homes that cater to families seeking a luxury lifestyle. These properties offer long-term appreciation and can attract higher-income tenants if used as rentals.</li>\n<li>New Build Strategy: Investors can purchase pre-construction homes at a lower cost and sell them later as the community develops. This strategy can capitalize on the growing popularity of Mahogany, with new phases and amenities continuing to enhance property values.</li>\n<li>rent-to-own: Mahogany offers a master-planned community with luxury amenities (e.g., lake access), making it ideal for families seeking high-quality living. The area is still developing, so long-term appreciation is likely as more amenities are completed. Rent-to-own could work well here, as families may aspire to eventually own in this desirable area.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"walden-deep-south\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#walden-deep-south\" aria-label=\"walden deep south permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Walden, deep south</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A relatively newer development, Walden offers a mix of modern, eco-friendly homes with easy access to parks and walking paths.

Older neighborhoods like Thorncliffe, Huntington Hills, and Brentwood provide affordable investment options with long-term growth potential.\nNewer communities: There was caution against investing in newer communities without established amenities. These areas are seen as long-term plays, where amenities are still being developed, but they may suffer from lower initial rental demand.</p>\n<p>Zoning and development: The forum emphasized the importance of understanding zoning changes and upcoming infrastructure projects (e.g., new CTrain routes) that can impact long-term investment value. Ogden, for example, is expected to see significant appreciation as zoning changes allow for more in-fill developments, and the CTrain extension improves accessibility.</p>\n<p>Rental trends: The forum noted that rental properties near key amenities like shopping, transit, and schools tend to perform better. They highlighted opportunities in townhouse and condo markets, especially in more affordable areas with high rental demand, such as Walden and Ogden.</p>\n<p>Long-term potential vs. current cash flow: Investors were encouraged to focus on long-term appreciation rather than just cash flow. Established communities in Calgary with solid infrastructure and accessibility (e.g., Midnapore, Huntington Hills, and Glenbrook) were recommended for steady growth over time.</p>\n<p>Neighborhood quality: Communities were categorized by potential for returns, with high-end neighborhoods like Aspen offering steady appreciation but higher entry points, while more affordable areas like Queensland and Thorncliffe showed greater short-term price jumps due to affordability-driven demand.</p>\n<p>Deep South\nMahogany, Walden, Copperfield, Cranson: High sales volumes and interest, driven by amenities like hospitals, parks, schools, and shopping centers. Accessibility via the Stoney Trail ring road boosts demand. Communities are desirable for both homebuyers and renters, with newer homes attracting young families.\nSouth Calgary\nMidnapore, Queensland, Ogden: Midnapore offers a lakeside community and good amenities. Queensland and Ogden are more affordable but have seen significant price appreciation, with rental demand increasing due to proximity to employment centers and the future CTrain line in Ogden, which is expected to push prices further.\nWest Calgary\nAspen, Springbank Hill, Glenbrook, Strathcona: These neighborhoods feature higher-end homes with substantial long-term appreciation potential. The west side is known for its proximity to quality schools, parks, and amenities like Westside Rec Centre. Aspen and Springbank Hill are high-cost areas but provide luxury and long-term gains. Glenbrook and Strathcona offer more affordable options with rental demand.\nNorthwest Calgary\nTuscany, Silver Springs, Ranchlands, Varsity: The northwest is characterized by easy access to transit and good amenities. Communities like Tuscany and Silver Springs have strong demand for both ownership and rentals. Older communities, including Ranchlands and Varsity, provide affordable homes with potential for renovation and solid returns.\nNorth Calgary\nThorncliffe, Beddington, Huntington Hills: These established neighborhoods are benefiting from affordability and future infrastructure, including the extension of the CTrain line. Thorncliffe in particular has larger lot sizes and is expected to see strong growth.\nNortheast Calgary\nWhitehorn, Rundle, Pineridge, Temple: Working-class communities close to transit and employment hubs like the airport. These areas offer affordable housing with strong rental demand, especially from families. Properties near the CTrain line are particularly desirable.\nSurrounding Towns\nCochrane, Airdrie, Chestermere: These towns are seeing increased demand from buyers looking for more affordable options outside Calgary. Rental demand is strong due to population growth and proximity to major employment centers like the airport and CrossIron Mills.\nHigh-End Neighborhoods\nMount Royal, Bel-Aire, Aspen Woods: These luxury neighborhoods have seen a decrease in sales volume due to higher interest rates but remain desirable for long-term investors and affluent homebuyers.</p>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bwalk.com/\">https://www.bwalk.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.rentfaster.ca/\">https://www.rentfaster.ca/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mycalgary.com/\">https://mycalgary.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.areavibes.com/\">https://www.areavibes.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zumper.com/\">https://www.zumper.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://calgary.ca\">https://calgary.ca</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"calgary communities research","date":"December 08, 2023","description":"calgary communities research"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/48-laws-power/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"48 laws of power by Robert Greene summary"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/5-love-language/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman summary"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2a1d2584-56c5-55fa-9d01-ca1531b31e55","previousPostId":"7ea09518-65a0-5445-81c1-dec254e0022b","nextPostId":"77e67d94-ed10-5de1-b2ca-2fcef0d72352"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}

for abstractions, but instead you should resist them until they absolutely insist upon being created.</li>\n<li>writing code is the process of working your way to the next stable end point, not the end point itself</li>\n<li>If your goal is to write straightforward code, these metrics (ABC metrics) point you toward <code class=\"language-text\">Shameless Green</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>rediscovering simplicity</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>getting insight into potential expense of code</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how difficult was it to write?</li>\n<li>how hard is it to understand?</li>\n<li>how expensive will it be to change?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>terminology: method vs sending messages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a “method” is defined on an object and contains behavior</li>\n<li>a “message” is sent to an object to invoke behavior\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">song() { verses(); }</code> means that song method sends the verses message to the receiver this.</li>\n<li>therefore, <strong>method are defined, and messages are sent</strong></li>\n<li>“sending messages” are preferred to “call a method/function” as it implicitly encourage to create message senders that are willfully ignorant of implementation details, and fosters independence between senders and receivers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>code is easy to understand when it clearly reflects the problem it’s solving, and thus openly exposes that problem’s domain</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>simplifying code</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>speculatively general and concretely abstract were both written with an eye toward reducing future costs, and it is distressing to see good intentions fail so spectacularly. <strong>The failure here is not bad intention - it’s insufficient patience.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>incomprehensibly concise</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marina-ferreira/99_bottles_of_oop/blob/main/chapter_1/01_incomprehensibly_concise.rb\">incomprehensibly concise code</a>\n<ul>\n<li>embeds a great deal of logic into the verse string</li>\n<li>the code is hard to understand because it is inconsistent and duplicative (pluralization logic), and because it contains hidden concepts that it does not name</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>speculatively general</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marina-ferreira/99_bottles_of_oop/blob/main/chapter_1/02_speculatively_general.rb\">speculatively general code</a>\n<ul>\n<li>there’s far more code here  than is needed to pass the tests. This unnecessary code took time to write</li>\n<li>the many levels of indirection are confusing. You could study this code for a long time without discerning why they are needed</li>\n<li>you may feel compelled to understand its purpose before making changes.</li>\n<li>what is the rule to determine which verse should be sung next? buried deep within the NoMore lambda is a hard-coded “99,” which might cause one to infer that verse 99 follows verse 0.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>concretely abstract</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“DRY makes sense when it reduces the cost of change more than it increases the cost of understanding the code”</strong></li>\n<li>DRYing out code is not free. It adds a level of indirection, and layers of indirection make the details of what’s happening harder to understanding.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marina-ferreira/99_bottles_of_oop/blob/main/chapter_1/03_concretely_abstract.rb\">concretely abstract code</a>\n<ul>\n<li>it clearly took a fair amount of thought and time.</li>\n<li>the individual methods are easy to understand, it’s tough to get a sense of the entire song. The parts doesn’t seem to add up to the whole</li>\n<li>while changing the code inside any individual method is cheap, in many cases, one simple change will cascade and force many other changes.</li>\n<li>what is the rule to determine which verse should be sung next? Ditto.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>shameless green</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>shameless green is defined as the solution that quickly reaches green while prioritizing understandability over changeability.</li>\n<li>it doesn’t dispute that DRY is good, rather, it believes that it is cheaper to manage temporary duplication than recover from incorrect abstractions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marina-ferreira/99_bottles_of_oop/blob/main/chapter_1/04_shameless_green.rb\">shameless green</a>\n<ul>\n<li>it was easy to write and understand</li>\n<li>it will be cheap to change. Even though the verse strings are duplicated, if one verse changes it’s easy to keep the others in sync.</li>\n<li>what is the rule to determine which verse should be sung next? This is still not explicit. The 0 verse contains a deeply buried, hard-coded 99</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>judging the code</h2>\n<h3>evaluating code based on opinion</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>look for context/concrete guidance of what the code trying to accomplish</li>\n<li><strong>any pile of code can be made to work; good code not only works, but it also simple, understandable, expressive and changeable</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>evaluating code based on facts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>you can think of metrics as crowd-sourced opinions about the quality of code.</li>\n<li>measuring programmer productivity by counting lines of code (SLOC))\n<ul>\n<li>easily garnered and reproduced, it reflects code volume but suffers from many flaws</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cyclomatic complexity\n<ul>\n<li>an algorithm that counts the number of unique execution paths through a body of source code. The more deeply nested conditionals, the higher Cyclomatic complexity</li>\n<li>the code with fewer nested conditionals (lower cyclomatic complexity) is easier to reason with and maintain</li>\n<li>can be used to limit the overall complexity. You can set standards for how high a score you’re willing to accept.</li>\n<li>you can use it to determine if you’ave written enough tests, as it tells you the minimum number of tests needed to cover all the logic in the code.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Assignments, branches and conditions (ABC) metrics\n<ul>\n<li>assignments is a count of variable assignments</li>\n<li>branches counts not branches of an if statement but branches of control, meaning function calls or message sends</li>\n<li>conditions counts conditional logic</li>\n<li>ABC scores reflect cognitive load as opposed to physical size. High ABC numbers indicate code that takes up a lot of mental space.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2b2d4dc88312b005c36cde35cf6e6b6c/0a47e/sloc-abc-metrics.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 61.39240506329114%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"metrics chart comparison\"\n        title=\"metrics chart comparison\"\n        src=\"/static/2b2d4dc88312b005c36cde35cf6e6b6c/0a47e/sloc-abc-metrics.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2b2d4dc88312b005c36cde35cf6e6b6c/c26ae/sloc-abc-metrics.png 158w,\n/static/2b2d4dc88312b005c36cde35cf6e6b6c/6bdcf/sloc-abc-metrics.png 315w,\n/static/2b2d4dc88312b005c36cde35cf6e6b6c/0a47e/sloc-abc-metrics.png 600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>metrics are fallible but human opinion is no more precise.

The purpose of some of your tests might very well be to prove that they represent bad ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>writing cost-effective tests</h2>\n<h3>intentional testing</h3>\n<h4>test benefits</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>finding bugs</li>\n<li>supplying documentation\n<ul>\n<li>write tests that remind you the story you once have</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>deferring design decisions\n<ul>\n<li>intentionally depending on interfaces allows you to use tests to put off design decision safely and without penalty</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>supporting abstractions\n<ul>\n<li>tests are your record of hte interface of every abstraction. They let you put off design decisions and create abstractions to any useful depth.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>exposing design flaws\n<ul>\n<li>if a test requires painful setup, the code expects too much context.</li>\n<li>if the test is hard to write, other objects will find the code difficult to reuse.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>knowing what to test</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>dealing with objects as if they are only and exactly the messages to which they respond lets you design a changeable application, and it is your understanding of the importance of this perspective that allows you to create tests that provide maximum benefit at minimum cost.</li>\n<li>tests should concentrate on the incoming or outgoing messages that cross an object’s boundaries. The incoming messages make up the public interface of hte receiving object. The outgoing messages, by definition, are incoming into other objects and so ar part of some other object’s interface.</li>\n<li>the general rule is that objects should make assertions about state only for messages in their own public interfaces.</li>\n<li>some outgoing messages have no side effects and thus matter only to their senders.\n<ul>\n<li>outgoing messages like this are known as queries and they need not be tested by the sending object.</li>\n<li>query messages are part of the public interface of their receiver, which already implements every necessary test of state.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>many outgoing messages do have side effects (a file gets written, a database record is saved, an action is taken by an observer) upon which your application depends.\n<ul>\n<li>proving that a message gets sent is a test of behavior, not state, and involves assertions about the number of times, and with what arguments, the message is sent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>incoming messages should be tested for the state they return.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>knowing when to test</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>you should write tests first, whenever it makes sense to do so</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>knowing how to test</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>if you understand the costs and benefits, feel free to choose any framework that suits you.</li>\n<li>BDD takes an outside-in approach, creating objects at the boundary of an application and working its way inward, mocking as necessary to supply as-yet-unwritten objects.</li>\n<li>TDD takes an inside-out approach, usually staring with tests of domain objects and then reusing these newly created domain objects in the tests of adjacent layers of code.</li>\n<li>when you tests know more about the internal inside of the object under test, it allows knowledge that should be private eto the object leak into the tests, increasing coupling between them and raising the likelihood that changes the code will require changes in tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>testing incoming messages</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>incoming messages make up an object’s public interface, the face it presents to the world. these messages need tests because other application objects depend on their signatures and on the results they return.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>deleting unused interfaces</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>incoming messages ought to have dependents. Some object other than the original implementer depends on each of these messages.</li>\n<li>do not test an incoming messages that has no dependents; delete it.</li>\n<li>unused code costs more to keep than to recover.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>providing the public interface</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>if Wheels are expensive to create, the Gear test pays that cost even though it has no interests in Wheel.</li>\n<li>an application constructed of tightly coupled, dependent laden objects is like a tapestry where pulling on one thread drags the entire rug along.\n<ul>\n<li>running Gear test would then create a large network of objects, any of which might break in a maddeningly confusing way.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>tests are the first reuse of code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>isolating the object under test</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>when you can’t test object in isolation, it bodes ill for the future.</li>\n<li>the diameter method is part of hte public interface of a role, one that might reasonably be named diameterizable.</li>\n<li>thinking of the injected object as a instance of its role gives you more choices about what kind of Diameterizable to inject into Gear during your tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>injecting dependencies using classes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>when the code in your test uses the same collaborating objects as the code in your application, your tests always break when they should.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>injecting dependencies as roles</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

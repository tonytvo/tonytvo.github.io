For example, “It sounds to me like you are feeling disappointed because I forgot.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One way to learn new patterns is to establish a daily sharing time in which each of you will talk about three things that happened to you that day and how you feel about them.

It communicates that she has your full attention</li>\n<li>Don’t listen to your partner and do something else at the same time. Remember, quality time is giving someone your undivided attention</li>\n<li>Listen for feelings. Ask yourself, “What emotion is my spouse experiencing?”</li>\n<li>Observe body language. Clenched fists, trembling hands, tears, furrowed brows, and eye movement give you clues as to what the other is feeling</li>\n<li>Refuse to interrupt. Let your spouse communicate their feelings without interjecting</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Individuals whose primary love language is quality time also emphasize <strong>doing activities together</strong> while giving each other undivided attention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quality is the keyword here, which excludes activities such as watching TV together (TV gets your attention) or driving (the road gets much of the attention).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid postponing dates, being distracted, and not listening to them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Playing a board game together after dinner.

It just means that a meaningful or thoughtful gift makes your partner feel loved and appreciated.</li>\n<li>“A gift is something you can hold in your hand and say, “Look, he was thinking of me,” or, “She remembered me.” You must be thinking of someone to give him a gift. The gift itself is a symbol of that thought.”</li>\n<li>If this is your partner’s love language, keep a list of all the gifts she has expressed excitement about receiving in the past.</li>\n<li>On top of gifts, your physical presence in a time of crisis is also important. Your body becomes the symbol of your love. Remove the symbol, and the sense of love evaporates.</li>\n<li>Reversal: If you never buy gifts and your partner’s love language is gifts, you are hurting them. Especially hurtful is missing gifts for celebrations, birthdays, and anniversaries.</li>\n<li><strong>by not purchasing gifts you ARE purchasing for yourself</strong>. You are purchasing emotional security and self-worth.

And since her husband always wants more sex with her, he recommends she have sex once a week first and then increase it to two times a week.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If one wants to give it a try to revive a marriage -or any relationship for that matter-, why not start from oneself first?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If it doesn’t work, that’s fine, at least you have tried everything.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the sex question, if one party wants to have more sex, there are only three ways to solve it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have more sex and make him happy;</li>\n<li>don’t have sex and only make yourself happy;</li>\n<li>or meet in the middle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And it was smart in the sense that sex also underpins an emotional connection, and can be an indicator of an improving relationship.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is It Too Religious?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chapman is a pastor and there are biblical references in “The 5 Love Languages“.</li>\n<li>But it’s not all based on religion and scriptures like, for example, Boundaries is. And personally, I didn’t find those references to take anything away from the main message.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is It Unscientific?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One of the main criticism against the 5 Love Languages instead is that of having a little scientific background.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As I listened to the audiobook, indeed, I couldn’t help but notice that Gary Chapman’s 5 Love Languages had little scientific research backing its claims.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>But the more I listened, the more it made sense.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But that’s not enough to validate such a big theory that can also be easily tested.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And since I have a deep distaste for pop psychology myths, I had to look deeper.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Turns out, research to confirm (or disprove) the 5 Love Languages don’t seem to reach a strong conclusion, partially because of the difficulty of measuring the phenomenon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, they seem to lend some scientific credibility to the 5 Love Languages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See: construct validation of the 5 languages of love and a validity test of Chapman’s 5 Love Languages.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I believe an experienced and good observer can be better than a few researchers in drawing valid theories. But those solid theories are better confirmed by research then.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How does your spouse respond when you try to show affection?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On a scale of 0–10, how full is your love tank?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can you pinpoint a time in your marriage when “reality” set in? How did this affect your relationship, for better or worse?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What would you most like to hear your spouse say to you?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What in your marriage detracts from spending quality time?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reflect on ways to give gifts even if finances are tight.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Many acts of service will involve household chores, but not all. What are some non-chore ways of serving your mate?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recall some non-sexual “touching times” that enhanced intimacy between the two of you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you think by now you have a good sense of what your spouse’s love language is? How about them for you? What more could you do to explore this?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A key thought here is the idea of speaking our mate’s love language whether or not it is natural for us. Why is this so fundamental to a healthy marriage?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What does your spouse do to make you feel more “significant”? How about what you do for them?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“No matter how hard you try to express love in English, if your spouse understands only Chinese, you will never understand how to love each other.”</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/the-5-love-languages/\">https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/the-5-love-languages/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dansilvestre.com/summaries/five-love-languages-summary/\">https://dansilvestre.com/summaries/five-love-languages-summary/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thepowermoves.com/the-5-love-languages/\">https://thepowermoves.com/the-5-love-languages/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman summary","date":"December 10, 2023","description":"The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman summary"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/calgary-communities-research/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"calgary communities research"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/100m-leads-summary/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"100M dollar leads by Alex Hormozi summary wip"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"77e67d94-ed10-5de1-b2ca-2fcef0d72352","previousPostId":"2a1d2584-56c5-55fa-9d01-ca1531b31e55","nextPostId":"4ab64577-8d20-58fe-b134-606b39667d07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}

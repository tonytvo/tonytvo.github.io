The code become the expression of the model, so a change to the code may be a change to the model. its effect must ripple through the rest of the project’s activities accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To tie implementation slavishly to a model usually requires software development tools and languages that support a modeling paradigm, such as object-oriented programming.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The underlying model of the system should be the same model shown to users. Otherwise, confusion will arise and the language will not be descriptive enough. Having different models can also cause unexpected behaviors to the users. An example to that is how Microsoft Internet Explorer modeled the bookmarks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the user, “Favorites” was a list of URLs but to the actual implementation a “Favorite” is a file that contains a URL. This meant that URL names had to follow windows file naming restrictions. So if a user saved a URL and named it “AOT: 3” they will get an error stating that file names cannot contain special characters like ”:” which is very confusing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DDD_Model_Exploration_Whirlpool.png\" alt=\"model exploration whirlpool\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if the people who write the code do not feel responsible for the model, or don’t understand how to make the model work for an application, then the model has nothing to do with the software. If developers don’t realize that changing code changes the model, then their refactoring will weaken the model rather than strengthen it. Meanwhile, when a modeler is separated from the implementation process, he or she never acquires, or quickly loses, a feel for the constraints of implementation. The basic constraint of MODEL-DRIVEN-DESIGN - that the model supports an effective implementation and abstracts key domain knowledge - is half gone, and the resulting models will be impractical. Finally, the knowledge and skills of experienced designers won’t be transferred to other developers if the division of labor prevents the kind of collaboration that conveys the subtleties of coding a MODEL-DRIVEN-DESIGN.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>any technical person contributing to the model must spend some time touching the code, whatever primary role he or she plays on the project. Anyone responsible for changing the model must learn to express a model through the code. Every developer must be involved in some level of discussion about the model and have contact with domain experts. Those who contribute to different ways must consciously engage those who touch the code in a dynamic exchange of model ideas through the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although a MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN does not have to be object oriented, it does depend on having an expressive implementation of the model constructs, be they objects, rules, or workflows. If the available tool does not facilitate that expressiveness, reconsider the choice of tools. An unexpressive implementation negates the advantage of the extra paradigm.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Here are four rules of thumb for mixing non-object elements into a predominantly object-oriented system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t fight the implementation paradigm. There’s always another way to think about a domain. Find model concepts that fit the paradigm.</li>\n<li>Lean on the ubiquitous language. Even when there is no rigorous connection between tools, very consistent use of language can keep parts of the design from diverging.</li>\n<li>Don’t get hung up on UML. Sometimes the fixation on a tool, such as UML diagramming, leads people to distort the model to make it fit what can easily be drawn. For example, UML does have some features for representing constraints, but they are not always sufficient. Some other style of drawing (perhaps conventional for the other paradigm), or simple English descriptions, are better than tortuous adaptation of a drawing style intended for a certain view of objects.</li>\n<li>Be skeptical. Is the tool really pulling its weight? Just because you have some rules, that doesn’t necessarily mean you need the overhead of a rules engine. Rules can be expressed as objects, perhaps a little less neatly; multiple paradigms complicate matters enormously.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"layered-architecture\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#layered-architecture\" aria-label=\"layered architecture permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>layered architecture</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>isolate the expression of the domain model and the business logic, and eliminate any dependency on infrastructure, user interface, or even application reason that is not business logic.

Let the ubiquitous language and its evolution be your guide to choosing documents that live and get woven into the project’s activity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is model driven design?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>contrasting 3 projects</p>\n<ul>\n<li>project 1 lacked domain model, or even common language on the project and were saddled with unstructured design. A year later, the team found itself bogged down unable to deliver the second version due to complexity in business logic.</li>\n<li>project 2 has incisive model, repeatedly refined and expressed in code, as the team gained new insight into the new domain, the model deepened. The quality of communication improved not only among developers, but also between developers and domain experts, and the design, far from imposing an ever heavier maintenance burden, became easier to modify and extend.</li>\n<li>project 3 involves teams with good tools and good understanding of business and it gave careful attention to modeling. But a poorly chosen separation of developer roles disconnected modeling from implementation, so that the design did not reflect the deep analysis that was going on. Repeated iteration produced no improvement in code, due to uneven skill levels among developers, who had no awareness of the informal body of style and technique for creating model-based objects that also function as practical running software. As months rolled by, development work became mired in complexity and the team lost its cohesive vision of the system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a domain model is not a particular diagram, it is the idea that the diagram is intended to convey. It is not just the knowledge in a domain’s expert’s head. It is a rigorously organized and selective abstraction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a model is a selectively simplified and consciously structured form of knowledge. An appropriate model makes sense of information and focuses it on a problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The utility of a model in domain-driven design</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>the model and the heart of the design shape each other</strong>. It is the intimate link between the model and the implementation that makes the model relevant and ensures that the analysis that went into it applies to the final products.</li>\n<li><strong>the model is the backbone of a language used by all team members</strong>.</li>\n<li>The model is distilled knowledge: the model is the team’s agreed upon way of structuring domain knowledge and distinguishing the elements of most interest. The model captures how we choose to think about the domain as we select terms, break down concepts, and relate them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>refer to the “How documents &#x26; diagrams can work for a project instead of just being work?” question on how documents and diagrams can help with model driven design</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>refer to <a href=\"#model-driven-design\">model driven design</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when a design is based on a model that reflects the basic concerns of the users and domain experts, the bones of the design can be revealed to the user to a greater extent than with other design approaches. Revealing the model gives the user more access to the potential of the software and yields consistent, predictable behaviors.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What Constitutes a Useful Model-Driven Design and How to Go About Finding Such a Design?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>True story: How model-driven design rescued a project and created unexpected opportunities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 576px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/75e0d76e1c8ee85ce3df31dd03a60808/533c1/original-models.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 72.78481012658227%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"original models\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/75e0d76e1c8ee85ce3df31dd03a60808/533c1/original-models.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/75e0d76e1c8ee85ce3df31dd03a60808/c26ae/original-models.png 158w,\n/static/75e0d76e1c8ee85ce3df31dd03a60808/6bdcf/original-models.png 315w,\n/static/75e0d76e1c8ee85ce3df31dd03a60808/533c1/original-models.png 576w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>model incrementally changed to solve problems.

In fact, the business experts had told us a number of times that they didn’t understand it. They had deferred to our software knowledge and assumed it was useful to the technical design. Actually, we had created it based on our incomplete understanding of the domain.</li>\n<li>suddenly, on the basis of this new way of looking at the domain, we could run through every scenario we had ever encountered relatively effortlessly, much more simply than ever before. And our model diagrams made perfect sense to the business experts, who had often indicated that the diagrams were “too technical” for them. Even just sketching on a whiteboard, we could see that our most persistent rounding problems would be pulled out by the roots, allowing us to scrap some of the complicated rounding code.</li>\n<li>it takes about 3 weeks to refactor to the new model without enough tests. Luckily, the project manager can take the heat and manage through the unstable political situation.</li>\n<li><strong>Share Pie</strong> became the unifying theme of the whole application. Marketing people used it to explain the features to prospective customers. Those prospects and customers immediately grasped it and used it to discuss features. It truly became part of the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE because it got to the heart of what loan syndication is about.</li>\n<li>To set the stage for a breakthrough, concentrate on knowledge crunching andn cultivating a robust UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE. Probe for important domain concepts and make them explicit in the model. Refine the design to be suppler. Distill the model. Push on these more predictable levers, which crease clarity, usually a precursor of breakthroughs.</li>\n<li>dont’t hold back from modest improvements, which gradually deepen the model, even if confined within the same general conceptual framework. Don’t be paralyzed by looking too far forward. Just be watchful for the opportunity.</li>\n<li><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/95ef5f6f74b1bcce31491431887168c1/8c857/another-model-breakthrough-contrains-transactions.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.06329113924051%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABHUlEQVR42pWTiYqEQAxE/f9fdEQYz/G+b83wAi3uIrLbELonk1SqkmjJH85xHHrP8yye54nv+zKO422sJf84fd+Lbdvyer1kmqZ7QFPdMIEFidu2nT7YVFUl67qebLnvzFqWRT6fjyYBFEWRSsI/DIMURSFZlkld1wqI8U7TVPZ9v2cIG3MDxJtgiiCNN/9d4yARx7ECJ0miv1FhXeVSHUADavymkAEljmRjbdtK0zRK4ASkd1QjkQDkcsqyFMdxzv4B4LquvmnF+/2W6xx+MPxtxo80ZCGfol3XaW8pRqFr/uPaIIFkmGCwA4ib4VGIAZkNeNxDBkFyEAS6d8gMw1B7hZ8hUCTPc90Oo+iRIQMAmCS+EPrFDTvs7mv5AlDDWdfWCfzXAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"another model breakthrough where contrains on transactions could be expressed with easy precision\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/95ef5f6f74b1bcce31491431887168c1/f058b/another-model-breakthrough-contrains-transactions.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/95ef5f6f74b1bcce31491431887168c1/c26ae/another-model-breakthrough-contrains-transactions.png 158w,\n/static/95ef5f6f74b1bcce31491431887168c1/6bdcf/another-model-breakthrough-contrains-transactions.png 315w,\n/static/95ef5f6f74b1bcce31491431887168c1/f058b/another-model-breakthrough-contrains-transactions.png 630w,\n/static/95ef5f6f74b1bcce31491431887168c1/8c857/another-model-breakthrough-contrains-transactions.png 761w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How software experts can work with domain experts to explore and refine models?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>many transformations of domain models and the corresponding code happen when developers recognize a concept that has been hinted at in discussion or present implicitly in the design, and they then represent it explicitly in the model with one or more objects or relationships.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>listen to the language the domain experts use.

A supple design helps limit mental overload primarily by reducing dependencies and side effects. It is based on a deep model of the domain that is fine-grained only where most critical to the users. This makes for flexibility where change is most common, and simplicity elsewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>timing</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>if you wait until you can make a complete justification for a change, you’ve waited too long.</em> Therefore, refactor when:\n<ul>\n<li>the design does not express the team’s current understanding of the domain</li>\n<li>important concepts are implicit in the design (and you see a way to make them explicit)</li>\n<li>you see an opportunity to make some important part of the design suppler.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What are the three principles for applying domain-driven design to large projects and enterprises?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>strategic design principles must guide design decision to reduce the interdependence of parts and improve clarity without losing critical interoperability and synergy. They must focus the model to capture the conceptual core of the system, the “vision” of the system. And <em>they must do all this without bogging the project down</em>. To help accomplish these goals, there are 3 board theme, context, distillation, and large-scale structures</li>\n<li><strong>context</strong>: a successful model, large or small, has to be logically consistent throughout, without contradictory or overlapping definitions. By explicitly defining the BOUNDED CONTEXT within which a model applies and then, when necessary, defining its relationship with other contexts, the modeler can avoid bastardizing the model.</li>\n<li><strong>distillation</strong>: reduces the clutter and focuses attention appropriately. Often a great deal of effort is spent on peripheral issues in the domain. The overall domain model needs to make prominent the most value-adding and special aspects of your system and be structured to give that part as much power as possible. While some supporting components are critical, they must be put into their proper perspective. This focus not only helps to direct efforts toward vital parts of the system, but it keeps the vision of the system from being lost. Strategic distillation can bring clarity to a large model. And with clearer view, the design the CORE DOMAIN can be made more useful.</li>\n<li><strong>large scale structure</strong>: In a very complex model, you may not see the forest for the trees. Some system-wide design elements and patterns can help. Some such structure can bring a uniformity to the design and accelerates development and improve integration.</li>\n<li>these 3 principles, useful separately but particularly powerful taken together, help to produce good designs, even in a sprawling system that no one completely understands. Large scale structure brings consistency to disparate parts to help those parts mesh. Structure and distillation make the complex relationships between parts comprehensible while keeping the big picture in iew. BOUNDED CONTEXTS allow work to proceed in different parts without corrupting the model or unintentionally fragmenting it. Adding these concepts to the team’s UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE helps developers work out their own solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bounded Context: Strategies for dealing with the inevitability of multiple viewpoints and conflicting needs.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Design is how it works</p>\n<p>People think that design is styling. Design is not style. It’s not about giving shape to the shell and not giving a damn about the guts. Good design is a renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need, and beauty to produce something that the world didn’t know it was missing.</p>\n<p>design is intelligence made visible</p>\n<p>[Design is] a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose.</p>\n<p>What is design? it’s where you stand with a foot in 2 worlds - the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes - and you try to bring the 2 together.</p>\n<p>Design isn’t just to satisfy requirements, but also to uncover requirements.</p>\n<p>perfection is not reached when there is nothing to be added anymore, but when there is nothing to be left out anymore.</p>\n<p>the design process, at its best, integrates the aspirations of art, science, and culture.</p>\n<p>to say that something is designed means it has intentions that go beyond its function. Otherwise, it’s just planning.</p>\n<p>good design defuses the tension between functional and aesthetic goals precisely because it works within the boundaries defined by the functional requirements of communication problem. Unlike the fine arts, which exists for their own sake, design must always solve a particular real-world problem.</p>\n<p>in practice, designing seems to proceed by oscillating between sub-solution and sub-problem areas, as well as decomposing the problem and combining sub-solutions.</p>\n<p>when you specify something to be designed, tell what properties you need, not how they are to be achieved.</p>\n<p>the trick is to hold “process” off long enough to permit great design to occur, so that the lesser issues can be debated once the great design is on the table - rather than smothering it in the cradle.</p>\n<p>good design is good business</p>\n<p>if you think it’s expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur</p>\n<p>design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all… good design must primarily serve people.</p>\n<p>questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point: design is inevitable. The alternative to good design is bad design, not no design at all. Everyone makes design decisions all the time without realizing it - like Moliere’s M. Jourdain who discovered he had been speaking prose all his life, and good design is simply the result of making these decisions consciously, at the right stage, and in consultation with others as the need arises.</p>\n<p>a good design is not the one that correctly predicts the future, it’s one that makes adapting to the future affordable</p>\n<p>everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.</p>\n<p>it’s very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better.</p>\n<p>we’ve probably designed 4000 products at IDEO over my career, and for every one of them I’d like to send a little note with it that says, “I’m sorry that it’s in this present state. Given what I know now, if I could start over again it would be a lot better”</p>\n<p>design is easy. All you do is stare at the screen until drops of blood form on your forehead.</p>\n<p>ease of use and ease of learning are not the same.</p>\n<p>computer design is often bad design done on a computer</p>\n<p>our opportunity as designers, is to learn how to handle the complexity, rather than shy away from it, and to realize that the big art of design is to make complicated things simple</p>\n<p>discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought</p>\n<p>no, Watson, this was not done by accident, but by design.</p>\n<p>design is about making things good (and then better) and right (and fantastic) for the people who use and encounter them.</p>\n<p>I never design a building before I’ve seen the site and met the people who will be using it.</p>\n<p>the only important thing about design is how it relates to people.</p>\n<p>a design isn’t finished until somebody is using it.</p>\n<p>Each of these techniques requires a successively greater commitment, but a knife gets sharper as its blade is ground finer. Successive distillation of a domain model produces an asset that gives the project speed, agility, and precision of execution.</p>\n<p>Creating distinctive software comes back to a stable team accumulating specialized knowledge and crunching it into a rich model</p>\n<p>Generic Subdomains reduce the clutter in the Core Domain, leaving it focused on what is more important.</p>\n<p>Cohesive Mechanisms are used to encapsulate complex operations used by the Domain.</p>\n<p>Realizing that your best idea is likely to get in somebody’s way takes humility</p>\n<p>The essence of good object design is to give each object a clear and narrow responsibility and to reduce interdependency to an absolute minimum</p>\n<p>A named thing we can discuss</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\"

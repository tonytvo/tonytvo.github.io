I’ll reiterate— <strong>knowing and not doing is the same as not knowing.</strong></li>\n<li>In my experience, I’ve found that entrepreneurs fail to implement for one of the following three reasons:</li>\n<li><strong>Paralysis by analysis</strong>: they keep trying to learn more or get stuck chasing the latest bright shiny object in the hope that they’ll get everything perfect the first time around.</li>\n<li>Remember 80% out the door is better than 100% in the drawer. Successful entrepreneurs have a bias for action, implement quickly and course correct along the way.</li>\n<li><strong>Inability to delegate</strong>: as mentioned in Chapter 5, business is a team sport.</li>\n<li><strong>“My business is different”</strong>: pretty much any conceivable problem you have or are going to encounter has been solved by someone at some time.</li>\n<li><strong>Time is Not Money</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>As entrepreneurs, we only get paid for bringing value to the market— not for time.</li>\n<li>Put simply entrepreneurs work in the results economy, whereas most other people work in the time and effort economy.</li>\n<li>The more times we create value by getting, retaining, and satisfying a customer, the more we get paid. Unfortunately, many business owners get distracted “playing business.” Playing business is when you do peripheral activities that don’t really create much value. Some examples of “playing business” include things like constantly checking email and endless, nonsense meetings that have no real point or agenda.</li>\n<li>Instead of playing business, you must do business. Winning in business requires you to have a relentless focus on the activities that deliver value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Your Transition from Business Owner to Marketer</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember, <strong>no one knows how good your products or services are until after the sale. Before they buy, they only know how good your marketing is. Put simply, the best marketer wins every time.</strong></li>\n<li>Marketing is the master skill of business. It will help you make your current business a success and, importantly, it will help make other businesses and enterprises you may be involved with in the future successful.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"act-i-the-before-phase\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#act-i-the-before-phase\" aria-label=\"act i the before phase permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Act I: The “Before” Phase</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>You’re dealing with prospects, people who may not even know you exist.

All that exists in the marketing world are perceptions in the minds of the customer or prospect. The perception is the reality. Everything else is an illusion.</li>\n<li>What some marketing people see as the natural laws of marketing are based on a flawed premise that the product is the hero of the marketing program and that you’ll win or lose based on the product’s merits.

Not a complicated word. Not an invented one. The simple words are best, words taken right out of the dictionary.</li>\n<li>This is the law of focus. You “burn” your way into the mind by narrowing the focus to a single word or concept. It’s the ultimate marketing sacrifice.</li>\n<li>In a way, the law of leadership — it’s better to be first than to be better — enables the first brand or company to own a word in the prospect’s mind. But the word the leader owns is so simple that it’s invisible.</li>\n<li>The leader owns the word that stands for the category.</li>\n<li>An astute leader will go one step further to solidify its position.</li>\n<li>If you’re not a leader, your word must have a narrow focus. Even more important, however, your word has to be “available “in your category. No one else can have a lock on it.</li>\n<li>The most effective words are simple and benefit-oriented. No matter how complicated the product is or the market’s needs, it’s always better to focus on one word or benefit rather than two or three or four.</li>\n<li>Also, there’s the halo effect. If you firmly establish one benefit, the prospect is likely to give you a lot of other benefits, too. A “thicker“ spaghetti sauce implies quality, nourishing ingredients, value, etc. A “safer“ car implies better design and engineering.</li>\n<li>Words come in different varieties. They can be benefit-related (cavity prevention), service-related (home delivery), audience-related (younger people), or sales-related (preferred brand).</li>\n<li>Although we’ve been touting that words stick in the mind, nothing lasts forever. There comes a time when a company must change words. It’s not an easy task.</li>\n<li>What won’t work in marketing is leaving your word in search of a word owned by others.</li>\n<li>The essence of marketing is narrowing the focus. You become more potent when you reduce the scope of your operations. You can’t stand for something if you chase after everything.</li>\n<li>You can’t narrow the focus with quality or any other idea that doesn’t have proponents for the opposite point of view.</li>\n<li>When you develop your word to focus on, be prepared to fend off the lawyers. They want to trademark everything you publish. The trick is to get others to use your word. (To be a leader, you have to have followers.)</li>\n<li>Once you have your word, you must go out of your way to protect it in the marketplace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-law-of-exclusivity-two-companies-cannot-own-the-same-word-in-the-prospects-mind\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-law-of-exclusivity-two-companies-cannot-own-the-same-word-in-the-prospects-mind\" aria-label=\"the law of exclusivity two companies cannot own the same word in the prospects mind permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Law of Exclusivity: Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect’s mind.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>When a competitor owns a word or position in the prospect’s mind, attempting to own the same word is futile.</li>\n<li>Despite the disaster stories, many companies violate the exclusivity law.

There are strategies to use for No. 2 and No. 3 brands.</li>\n<li>All products are not created equal. There’s a hierarchy in the mind that prospects use in making decisions. For each category, there is a product ladder in mind. On each rung is a brand name.</li>\n<li>Your marketing strategy should depend on how soon you got into the mind and which rung of the ladder you occupy. The higher the better, of course.</li>\n<li>What about your product’s ladder in the prospect’s mind? How many rungs are there on your ladder? It depends on whether your product is a high-interest or a low-interest product.</li>\n<li>Products you use daily (cigarettes, cola, beer, toothpaste, cereal) are high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders.</li>\n<li>Products purchased infrequently (furniture, lawnmowers, luggage) usually have few rungs on their ladders.</li>\n<li>Products that involve a great deal of personal pride (automobiles, watches, cameras) are also high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders even though they are purchased infrequently.</li>\n<li>There’s a relationship between market share and your position on the ladder in the prospect’s mind. You tend to have twice the brand’s market share below you and half the market share above you.</li>\n<li>What’s the maximum number of rungs on a ladder? There seems to be a rule of seven in the prospect’s mind. Ask someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category.</li>\n<li>The ladder is a simple, but powerful, analogy that can help you deal with the critical issues in marketing. Before starting any marketing program, ask yourself: Where are we on the ladder in the prospect’s mind? On the top rung? On the second rung?

The next day the same company is spread thin over many products and is losing money.</li>\n<li>In a narrow sense, line extension involves taking the brand name of a successful product (e.g., A-1 steak sauce) and putting it on a new product you plan to introduce (e.g., A-1 poultry sauce).</li>\n<li>But marketing is a battle of perception, not product. In the mind, A-1 is not the brand name, but the steak sauce itself.</li>\n<li>In the long run and the presence of serious competition, line extensions almost never work.</li>\n<li>Invariably, the leader in any category is the brand that is not line extended.</li>\n<li>Why does top management believe that line extension works despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary? One reason is that while line extension is a loser in the long term, it can be a winner in the short term ( chapter 11: The Law of Perspective ). An intense loyalty to the company or brand also blinds management.</li>\n<li>More is less. The more products, the more markets, the more alliances a company makes, the less money it makes.</li>\n<li>Less is more. If you want to be successful today, you must narrow the focus to build a position in the prospect’s mind.</li>\n<li>For many companies, line extension is the easy way out. Launching a new brand requires money and an idea or concept. For a new brand to succeed, it should be first in a new category (chapter 1: The Law of Leadership). Or the new brand ought to be positioned as an alternative to the leader (chapter 9: The Law of the Opposite). Companies that wait until a new market has developed often find these two preempted leadership positions. So they fall back on the old reliable line extension approach. The antidote for a line extension is corporate courage, a commodity in short supply.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-law-of-sacrifice-you-must-give-up-something-to-get-something\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-law-of-sacrifice-you-must-give-up-something-to-get-something\" aria-label=\"the law of sacrifice you must give up something to get something permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Law of Sacrifice: You must give up something to get something.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The law of sacrifice is the opposite of the law of line extension.

Where is it written that the more you have to sell, the more you sell?</li>\n<li>The entire line is a luxury for a loser. If you want to be successful, you must reduce your product line, not expand it.</li>\n<li>The business world is populated by giant, highly diversified generalists and small, narrowly focused specialists.

Most of them are in trouble.</li>\n<li>The generalist is weak.</li>\n<li>Let’s discuss the second sacrifice, the target market. Where is it written that you have to appeal to everybody?</li>\n<li>The target is not the market. That is, the apparent target of your marketing is not the same as the people who will buy your product.</li>\n<li>Finally, the third sacrifice: constant change. Where is it written that you must change your strategy yearly at budget review time?</li>\n<li>If you try to follow the twists and turns of the market, you are bound to wind up off the road.

You must find your word to own. You must seek out another attribute.</li>\n<li>It’s much better to search for an opposite attribute that will allow you to play off against the leader. The key word here is the opposite—similar won’t do.</li>\n<li>Marketing is a battle of ideas. So to succeed, you must have an idea or attribute to focus your efforts around. Without one, you had better have a low price. A very low price.</li>\n<li>Some say all attributes are not created equal. Some attributes are more important to customers than others. You must try and own the most critical attribute.</li>\n<li>But the law of exclusivity points to the simple truth that once your competition successfully takes an attribute, it’s gone.

Why does a dose of honesty work so well in the marketing process?</li>\n<li>First and foremost, candour is very disarming. Every negative statement you make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth. Positive statements, on the other hand, are looked at as dubious at best, especially in an advertisement.</li>\n<li>You have to prove a positive statement to the prospect’s satisfaction. No proof is needed for a negative statement.</li>\n<li>If your name is terrible, you have two choices: change the name or make fun of it. The one thing you can’t do is ignore a bad name.</li>\n<li>So why go with the obvious? Marketing is often a search for the obvious. Since you can’t change a mind once made up, your marketing efforts must be devoted to using ideas and concepts already installed in the brain.</li>\n<li>When a company starts a message by admitting a problem, people instinctively open their minds.</li>\n<li>One final note: The law of candour must be used carefully and skillfully. First, your “negative “must be widely perceived as negative. It has to trigger an instant agreement with your prospect’s mind. If the negative doesn’t register quickly, your prospect will be confused and wonder, “What’s this all about?”</li>\n<li>Next, you have to shift quickly to the positive. The purpose of candour isn’t to apologize. The purpose of candour is to set up a benefit that will convince your prospect.</li>\n<li>This law only proves the old maxim: Honesty is the best policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-law-of-singularity-only-one-move-will-produce-substantial-results-in-each-situation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-law-of-singularity-only-one-move-will-produce-substantial-results-in-each-situation\" aria-label=\"the law of singularity only one move will produce substantial results in each situation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Law of Singularity: Only one move will produce substantial results in each situation.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Many marketing people see success as the total of beautifully executed small efforts.</li>\n<li>History teaches that the only thing that works in marketing is the single, bold stroke.

Yet marketing plans based on what will happen are usually wrong.</li>\n<li>Failure to forecast competitive reactions is a significant reason for marketing failures.</li>\n<li>Most companies live from quarterly reports to quarterly reports. That’s a recipe for problems. Companies that live by the numbers, die by the numbers.</li>\n<li>Good short-term planning is coming up with that angle or word that differentiates your product or company. Then you set up a coherent long-term marketing direction that builds a program to maximize that idea or angle. It’s not a long-term plan, it’s a long-term direction.</li>\n<li>So what can you do? How can you best cope with unpredictability? While you can’t predict the future, you can get a handle on trends, which is a way to take advantage of change.</li>\n<li>The danger in working with trends is extrapolation. Many companies jump to conclusions about how far a trend will go.</li>\n<li>Equally as bad as extrapolating a trend is the common practice of assuming the future will be a replay of the present. When you assume nothing will change, you predict the future, just as when you assume something will change. Remember Peter’s Law: The unexpected always happens.</li>\n<li>While tracking trends can be valuable in dealing with the unpredictable future, market research can be more of a problem than a help. Research does best at measuring the past. New ideas and concepts are almost impossible to measure. No one has a frame of reference.</li>\n<li>One way to cope with an unpredictable world is to build enormous flexibility into your organization. As change comes sweeping through your category, you have to be willing to change and change quickly if you are to survive in the long term.</li>\n<li>One final note worth mentioning: There’s a difference between “predicting “the future and “taking a chance “on the future.</li>\n<li>No one can predict the future with any degree of certainty.

You preempted a powerful attribute.</li>\n<li>Actually, ego is helpful. It can be an influential driving force in building a business. What hurts is injecting your ego into the marketing process. Brilliant marketers have the ability to think like a prospect thinks. They put themselves in the shoes of their customers.

A fad gets a lot of hype, and a trend gets very little.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like a wave, a fad is visible but goes up and down in a big hurry. Like the tide, a trend is almost invisible but very powerful over the long term.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A fad is a short-term phenomenon that might be profitable, but a fad doesn’t last long enough to do a company much good.</li>\n<li>When the fad disappears, a company often goes into a deep financial shock.</li>\n<li>Here’s the paradox. If you were faced with a rapidly rising business, with all the characteristics of a fad, the best thing you could do would be to dampen the fad. By dampening the fad, you stretch it out, and it becomes more like a trend.</li>\n<li>Forget fads. And when they appear, try to dampen them. One way to maintain a long-term demand for your product is never totally to satisfy the demand.</li>\n<li>But the best, most profitable thing to ride in marketing is a long-term trend.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-law-of-resources-an-idea-wont-get-off-the-ground-without-adequate-funding\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-law-of-resources-an-idea-wont-get-off-the-ground-without-adequate-funding\" aria-label=\"the law of resources an idea wont get off the ground without adequate funding permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Law of Resources: An idea won’t get off the ground without adequate funding.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a good idea and you’ve picked up this book with the thought that all you need is a little marketing help, this chapter will throw cold water on that thought.</li>\n<li>Even the best idea in the world won’t go far without the money to get it off the ground. Inventors, entrepreneurs, and assorted idea generators seem to think their good ideas need professional marketing help.</li>\n<li>Nothing could be further from the truth. Marketing is a game fought in the mind of the prospect. You need money to get into your mind. And you need money to stay in your mind once you get there.</li>\n<li>You’ll get further with a mediocre idea and a million dollars than a great idea alone.</li>\n<li>Ideas without money are worthless. Well … not quite. But you must use your idea to find the money, not the marketing help. The marketing can come later.</li>\n<li>Remember: An idea without money is worthless. Be prepared to give away a lot for the funding.</li>\n<li>In marketing, the rich often get richer because they have the resources to drive their ideas into the mind. Their problem is separating the good ideas from the bad ones, and avoiding spending money on too many products and too many programs (chapter 5: The Law of Focus).</li>\n<li>Unlike a consumer product, a technical or business product has to raise less marketing money because the prospect list is shorter and media is less expensive. But there is still a need for adequate funding for a technical product to pay for brochures, sales presentations, trade shows, and advertising.</li>\n<li>Here is the bottom line. First, get the idea, then get the money to exploit it.</li>\n<li>We’ve talked about smaller companies and their fund-raising strategies. What about a rich company? How should it approach the law of resources? The answer is simple: Spend enough.</li>\n<li>The more successful marketers front-load their investment. In other words, they take no profit for two or three years as they plow all earnings back into marketing.</li>\n<li>Money makes the marketing world go round. To succeed today, you’ll have to find the money you need to spin those marketing wheels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“2 The Law of the Category: If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in.”</p>\n<p>“Everyone is interested in what’s new.

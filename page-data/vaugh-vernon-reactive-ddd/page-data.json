But you may not be actually using them successfully. If you haven’t started yet, you must learn to leverage the power of this approach. And even if you’ve already achieved a measure of success, you still want to ensure your business’s viability and long-term flexibility in design that responds well to the inevitable ongoing change. And why stop at event driven when your entire system can be reactive through message-driven architectures, both inside single services and across many collaborating services?</p>\n<p>Vaughn Vernon walks you through DDD context mapping with open host service and Published Language and describes how to integrate using reactive implementations that transform streaming to well-designed solutions. Employing the right tools is key.</p>\n<p>Bio\nVaughn Vernon is the founder, principal architect, and developer of VLINGO/PLATFORM. A software developer and architect with more than 35 years of experience in a broad range of business domains, Vaughn is a leading expert in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and champion of simplicity and reactive systems. The open source, DDD-friendly, reactive VLINGO/PLATFORM is one example of his commitment to balancing the right technology choices with every essential and unique business vision. He consults on and teaches DDD and reactive software development, helping teams and organizations realize the potential of business-driven and reactive systems as they transition from technology-driven legacy web implementation approaches, putting a strong emphasis on embracing simplicity whenever possible. Vaughn is the editor of his Vaughn Vernon Signature Series and the author of four books: Strategic Monoliths and Microservices, Implementing Domain-Driven Design, Domain-Driven Design Distilled, and Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model, all published by Addison-Wesley.</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://vlingo.io\">https://vlingo.io</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Vaughn Vernon: Reactive DDD With Message Streaming","path":"/vaugh-vernon-reactive-ddd/","category":"AutomationTesting","tags":["DDD","Reactive","Message","Architecture","Design"],"description":"Reactive DDD With Message Streaming with Vaugh Vernon","date":"2021/04/21","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/8ceee61a7253210f2155bfdfaabaab6b/0f3a1/vaugh-vernon.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8ceee61a7253210f2155bfdfaabaab6b/1ada3/vaugh-vernon.jpg 125w,\n/static/8ceee61a7253210f2155bfdfaabaab6b/8f7df/vaugh-vernon.jpg 250w,\n/static/8ceee61a7253210f2155bfdfaabaab6b/0f3a1/vaugh-vernon.jpg 500w,\n/static/8ceee61a7253210f2155bfdfaabaab6b/4fe8c/vaugh-vernon.jpg 600w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

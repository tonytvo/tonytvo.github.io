This is a problem because asset returns tend to “mean revert.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you can predict the inputs to the optimizer well enough, then you didn’t need an optimizer, to begin with.</li>\n<li>Don’t use an optimizer to try to develop an asset allocation. We can’t predict returns, standard deviations, or correlations accurately enough.

And during a bear market, stocks usually decline much faster than they advance during a bull market. But you don’t want to get out of the market then because you will miss the rally.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long-term returns are usually higher when valuations are cheap and lower when they are expensive</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paul Miller did the first study on cheap stocks called the Dow P/E strategy. He examined buying the ten lowest P/E stocks in the Dow from 1936-1964 and discovered that the lowest P/E stocks (those everyone hates) outperformed the market, and the highest P/E stocks (those everyone loves) greatly underperformed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dreman has observed that “value” stocks tend to fall less in price than “growth” stocks when earnings disappoint. Conversely, “value” stocks tend to rise more in price than “growth” stocks when earnings exceed expectations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To put it another way, good companies are generally bad stocks, and bad companies are generally good stocks</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It has puzzled academics EMH theorists why these value-type strategies have worked so well for so long, even after they were discovered. (The market should have arbitrated this away long ago). The reason the strategies still work is that cheap companies are dogs, and most people cannot bring themselves to buy them. This concept is very difficult for investors and money managers alike.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The best explanation for value stocks can be found in Robert Haugen’s The New Finance: The Case Against Efficient Markets. In 1993 the highest 20% P/E stocks (Growth) had an average P/E of 42. The earnings yield was 2.36% or 1/42. The lowest 20% P/E stocks (Value) had a P/E of 12. The earnings yield was 8.38% or 1/12. So, if you bought growth stocks in 1993, you received $2.36 for every $100 invested. If you bought value stocks, you received $8.38 in earnings for every $100 invested. That means growth stocks’ earnings have to grow 3x larger than value stocks to break even. The growth stocks did have higher earnings than value, but not enough to catch up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The behavioural (people don’t like buying bad companies) and increased risk (companies are not in great financial shape) explain value companies’ higher returns than growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Value companies tend to do better than growth during bear markets</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dividend Discount Method (DDM) formulated by John Burr Williams in 1938 was formulated by a simple idea. Since all companies eventually go bankrupt, the value of a stock, bond or the entire market is simply the value of all its future dividends discounted to the present.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>And since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, its value must be reduced or discounted to reflect the fact you won’t receive it today.\n<ul>\n<li>The reduction is called the Discount Rate (DR)\n<ul>\n<li>The DR is determined by the cost of money (Risk-Free Rate) plus the risk to the lender\n<ul>\n<li>Safer investments have a lower DR, and risker investments have a higher DR</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>DR can also be thought of as the expected return on the asset\n<ul>\n<li>Lower risks = lower DR = Lower expected return/Higher Present Value</li>\n<li>Higher risks = higher DR = Higher expected return/Lower Present Value</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Formula – Reasonable Price = (Annual Dividend Amount)/(DR – Dividend Growth Rate)\n<ul>\n<li>But you can make this formula say anything you want, depending on your inputs. So be careful with this formula</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dynamic asset allocation is the possibility of varying your policy allocation because of changing market conditions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only people who have mastered fixed asset allocation and the required rebalancing should consider dynamic asset allocation.</li>\n<li>He used to recommend changing your equity/bond AA based on conditions, but that doesn’t work anymore. Now he only recommends changing equity allocations</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When stocks get more expensive, their future returns are likely to be lower; when stocks are very cheap, future returns are likely to be higher.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Based on this, it is not a terrible idea to change your AA slightly in the opposite direction based on valuations, but not by much.\n<ul>\n<li>When you rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target AA, you purchase more of an asset that has declined in price and is thus cheaper.\n<ul>\n<li>When you increase the target portfolio weighting of an asset when its price declines and gets cheaper, you are simply rebalancing in a more vigorous form – you are “overbalancing.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Do not change your AA based on changes in economic or political conditions or analyst recommendations. That is a poor idea\n<ul>\n<li>In the authors’ opinion, overbalancing is likely to increase returns if done correctly. But few investors have the nerve and discipline to rebalance, and “overbalancing” requires even more of that nerve and discipline so few should try it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Human beings experience risk in the short term. This is because, in nature, our ancestors had to focus on short-term risks to survive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfortunately, this is of less value in modern society, specifically in investing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vanguard and DFA are great choices for funds. The shareholders own Vanguard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) vs Lump Sum investing – from a purely financial point of view, it is usually better to put your money to work immediately. However, if you are not used to owning risk assets, then it might be best to go slow and DCA your way into the market</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DCA – involves investing the same amount regularly in a given fund</li>\n<li>Do not underestimate the discipline that is sometimes necessary to carry out a successful DCA program.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Value Averaging (VA) – Is another technique for investing in the market (read the book for more information on how to do it)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Become familiar with the long-term history of the behaviour of different classes of stocks and bonds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Portfolios behave differently than their constituent parts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A safe portfolio does not necessarily exclude very risky assets. Even the investor who seeks the safest possible portfolio will own some risky assets</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The investor’s objective then is not to find the efficient frontier, rather the goal is to find a portfolio mix that will come reasonably close to the mark under a broad range of circumstances</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Focus on the behaviour of your whole portfolio, not its parts. Some will be doing very well or very badly at times</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The markets are smarter than you are</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not run with the crowd</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keep an eye on market valuations</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changes in your policy AA should be made only in response to valuations changes and in a direction opposite the market</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Good companies are usually bad stocks; bad companies are usually good stocks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Favor a “value” approach to investing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"asset-allocation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#asset-allocation\" aria-label=\"asset allocation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>asset allocation</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When to change your asset allocation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 Reasons to change your AA\n<ul>\n<li>Financial goal is well within reach</li>\n<li>You realize you will not need all your money during your lifetime</li>\n<li>Your risk tolerance isn’t what you thought it was</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Any AA changes should require deep thinking and even-handed judgement.

Econs are rational by this definition, but there is overwhelming evidence that Humans cannot be. An Econ would not be susceptible to priming, WYSIATI, narrow framing, the inside view, or preference reversals, which Humans cannot consistently avoid.</li>\n<li>The definition of rationality as coherence is impossibly restrictive; it demands adherence to rules of logic that a finite mind is not able to implement.</li>\n<li>The assumption that agents are rational provides the intellectual foundation for the libertarian approach to public policy: do not interfere with the individual’s right to choose, unless the choices harm others.</li>\n<li>Thaler and Sunstein advocate a position of libertarian paternalism, in which the state and other institutions are allowed to nudge people to make decisions that serve their own long-term interests. The designation of joining a pension plan as the default option is an example of a nudge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two Systems</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What can be done about biases? How can we improve judgments and decisions, both our own and those of the institutions that we serve and that serve us? The short answer is that little can be achieved without a considerable investment of effort. As I know from experience, System 1 is not readily educable. Except for some effects that I attribute mostly to age, my intuitive thinking is just as prone to overconfidence, extreme predictions, and the planning fallacy as it was before I made a study of these issues. I have improved only in my ability to recognize situations in which errors are likely: “This number will be an anchor…,” “The decision could change if the problem is reframed…” And I have made much more progress in recognizing the errors of others than my own</li>\n<li>The way to block errors that originate in System 1 is simple in principle: recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down, and ask for reinforcement from System 2.</li>\n<li>Organizations are better than individuals when it comes to avoiding errors, because they naturally think more slowly and have the power to impose orderly procedures. Organizations can institute and enforce the application of useful checklists, as well as more elaborate exercises, such as reference-class forecasting and the premortem.</li>\n<li>At least in part by providing a distinctive vocabulary, organizations can also encourage a culture in which people watch out for one another as they approach minefields.</li>\n<li>The corresponding stages in the production of decisions are the framing of the problem that is to be solved, the collection of relevant information leading to a decision, and reflection and review. An organization that seeks to improve its decision product should routinely look for efficiency improvements at each of these stages.</li>\n<li>There is much to be done to improve decision making. One example out of many is the remarkable absence of systematic training for the essential skill of conducting efficient meetings.</li>\n<li>Ultimately, a richer language is essential to the skill of constructive criticism.</li>\n<li>Decision makers are sometimes better able to imagine the voices of present gossipers and future critics than to hear the hesitant voice of their own doubts. They will make better choices when they trust their critics to be sophisticated and fair, and when they expect their decision to be judged by how it was made, not only by how it turned out.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c7b6b6a27ee743f3839c18f19e568ee8/b2cef/summary-2-systems.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 29.11392405063291%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABKElEQVR42jVRi5KCMBDj//9NRj0EFIpS0OJBaXmc441ibndPmelsH9kkG4JhGDCMA7xz2G62CFcrVFUF5zzatsXtdsM4jrC9hfce0zQhTRKEYYg4TtBbK+v1euF8PiNI4hgqV8jzHEVR0J6qUrherzCXC0YS7LoW0Vck71mW4bDf40h77knTFAkJFHJWCJqmoYZOmo0x+CZXTMZuHLlmR4zZrDfIiSyKIpxOp38si1K1b5dHug+01tClFgWtKyHyfkDf93De4fF4EKFBdshQ17XgyrKEUgXqqn73adzvv1KDxjTkzogSO2GnrnewnRXSZVnkPqZo9jQqV57gQjjOjEX4fZ5/JPuA7X7GYxLObKGAZT2fEjZnuNvtxIE4JyzXT988zeCPf8ofgSW8fVtJiOAAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"summary of 2 systems\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/c7b6b6a27ee743f3839c18f19e568ee8/f058b/summary-2-systems.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c7b6b6a27ee743f3839c18f19e568ee8/c26ae/summary-2-systems.png 158w,\n/static/c7b6b6a27ee743f3839c18f19e568ee8/6bdcf/summary-2-systems.png 315w,\n/static/c7b6b6a27ee743f3839c18f19e568ee8/f058b/summary-2-systems.png 630w,\n/static/c7b6b6a27ee743f3839c18f19e568ee8/b2cef/summary-2-systems.png 847w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>how much do we know?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>what did our brains evolve to do?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Most of us think we know more than we actually do.

Indeed, it’s our ability to divide cognitive labor and share intentionality that’s led to our species’s success.

The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I describe System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 generate surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In rough order of complexity, here are some examples of the automatic activities that are attributed to System 1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect that one object is more distant than another.</li>\n<li>Orient to the source of a sudden sound.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The highly diverse operations of System 2 have one feature in common: they require attention and are disrupted when attention is drawn away. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy room.</li>\n<li>Count the occurrences of the letter a in a page of text.</li>\n<li>Check the validity of a complex logical argument.</li>\n<li>It is the mark of effortful activities that they interfere with each other, which is why it is difficult or impossible to conduct several at once.</li>\n<li>The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.</li>\n<li>One of the tasks of System 2 is to overcome the impulses of System 1. In other words, System 2 is in charge of self-control.</li>\n<li>The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Attention and Effort</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>People, when engaged in a mental sprint, become effectively blind.</li>\n<li>As you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes.

Several psychological studies have shown that people who are simultaneously challenged by a demanding cognitive task and by a temptation are more likely to yield to the temptation.</li>\n<li>People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations. A few drinks have the same effect, as does a sleepless night.</li>\n<li>Baumeister’s group has repeatedly found that an effort of will or self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. The phenomenon has been named ego depletion.</li>\n<li>The evidence is persuasive: activities that impose high demands on System 2 require self-control, and the exertion of self-control is depleting and unpleasant. Unlike cognitive load, ego depletion is at least in part a loss of motivation. After exerting self-control in one task, you do not feel like making an effort in another, although you could do it if you really had to. In several experiments, people were able to resist the effects of ego depletion when given a strong incentive to do so.</li>\n<li>Restoring glucose levels can have a counteracting effect to mental depletion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-associative-machinepriming\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-associative-machinepriming\" aria-label=\"the associative machinepriming permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Associative Machine/Priming</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Priming effects take many forms. If the idea of EAT is currently on your mind (whether or not you are conscious of it), you will be quicker than usual to recognize the word SOUP when it is spoken in a whisper or presented in a blurry font. And of course you are primed not only for the idea of soup but also for a multitude of food-related ideas, including fork, hungry, fat, diet, and cookie.</li>\n<li>Priming is not limited to concepts and words; your actions and emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware, including simple gestures.</li>\n<li>Money seems to prime individualism: reluctance to be involved with, depend on, or accept demands from others.</li>\n<li>Note: the effects of primes are robust but not necessarily large; likely only a few in a hundred voters will be affected.</li>\n<li>Priming happens when exposure to one idea makes you more likely to favor related ones.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, when asked to complete the word fragment SO_P, people primed with ‘eat’ will usually complete SOUP. Meanwhile, people primed with ‘wash’ will usually complete SOAP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>System 1 helps us make quick connections between causes and effects, things and their properties, and categories</strong>. By priming us (i.e., “pre-fetching” information based on recent stimuli and pre-existing associations) System 1 helps us make rapid sense of the infinite network of ideas that fills our sensory world, without having to analyze everything.</li>\n<li>Priming usually works because the most familiar answer is also the most likely. But priming causes issues when System 2 leans on these associations inappropriately.</li>\n<li>Instead of considering all options equally, System 1 gives ‘primed’ associations priority instead of relying on facts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"cognitive-ease\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#cognitive-ease\" aria-label=\"cognitive ease permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cognitive Ease</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cognitive ease: no threats, no major news, no need to redirect attention or mobilize effort.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cognitive strain: affected by both the current level of effort and the presence of unmet demands; requires increased mobilization of System 2.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Memories and thinking are subject to illusions, just as the eyes are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Predictable illusions inevitable occur if a judgement is based on an impression of cognitive ease or strain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to make recipients believe something, general principle is to ease cognitive strain: make font legible, use high-quality paper to maximize contrasts, print in bright colours, use simple language, put things in verse (make them memorable), and if you quote, make sure it’s an easy name to pronounce.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Weird example: stocks with pronounceable tickers do better over time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mood also affects performance: happy moods dramatically improve accuracy.

But researchers found that System 1 often responds with an intuitive, incorrect answer of 10 cents (correct = 5 cents).</li>\n<li>Interestingly, when the students saw the question in a less legible font, cognitive ease decreased. Far fewer made the error because System 2 was more likely to engage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Because we try to conserve mental energy, if cognitive ease is high, and our brain thinks it can solve a problem with System 1, it will not switch to System 2.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Note: Advertising has long used this technique to persuade people to make instinctive purchase decisions.

Norms, Surprises, and Causes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We can detect departures from the norm (even small ones) within two-tenths of a second.</li>\n<li>To make sense of the world we tell ourselves stories about what’s going on. We make associations between events, circumstances, and regular occurrences. The more these events fit into our stories the more normal they seem.</li>\n<li>Things that don’t occur as expected take us by surprise. To fit those surprises into our world we tell ourselves new stories to make them fit. We say, “Everything happens for a purpose,” “God did it,” “That person acted out of character,” or “That was so weird it can’t be random chance.” Abnormalities, anomalies, and incongruities in daily living beg for coherent explanations. Often those explanations involve 1) assuming intention, “It was meant to happen,” 2) causality, “They’re homeless because they’re lazy,” or 3) interpreting providence, “There’s a divine purpose in everything.” “We are evidently ready from birth to have impressions of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation,” (page 76). “Your mind is ready and even eager to identify agents, assign them personality traits and specific intentions, and view their actions as expressing individual propensities,” (page 76). Potential for error? We posit intention and agency where none exists, we confuse causality with correlation, and we make more out of coincidences than is statistically warranted.</li>\n<li><strong>System 1 uses norms to maintain our model of the world, and constantly updates them</strong>. They tell us what to expect in a given context.</li>\n<li>Surprises should trigger the activation of System 2 because they are outside of these models.

When asked, “Is Sam friendly?” different instances of Sam’s behavior will come to mind than would if you had been asked “Is Sam unfriendly?” A deliberate search for confirming evidence, known as positive test strategy, is also how System 2 tests a hypothesis.

The most representative outcomes combine with the personality description to produce the most coherent stories. The most coherent stories are not necessarily the most probable, but they are plausible, and the notions of coherence, plausibility, and probability are easily confused by the unwary.</li>\n<li><strong>The conjunction fallacy, or the Linda problem, happens because System 1 prefers more complete stories (over simpler alternatives).</strong></li>\n<li>A scenario with more variables is less likely to be true. But because it provides a more complete and persuasive argument for System 1, System 2 can falsely estimate that it is more likely.</li>\n<li>For example, a woman (‘Linda’) was described to participants in a study as “single, outspoken and very bright”. They were more likely to categorize her as a “bank teller who is an active feminist” than “a bank teller”.</li>\n<li>It is less probable that someone would belong in the first category (since it requires two facts to be true), but it feels truer.

The rapid and automatic judgements of chess masters, fire chiefs, and doctors illustrate these.</li>\n<li>Others, which are sometimes subjectively indistinguishable from the first, arise from the operation of heuristics that often substitute an easy question for the harder one that was asked.</li>\n<li>We are capable of rejecting information as irrelevant or false, but adjusting for smaller weaknesses in the evidence is not something that System 1 can do. As a result, intuitive predictions are almost completely insensitive to the actual predictive quality of the evidence.</li>\n<li>A Correction for Inuitive Predictions\n<ul>\n<li>Recall that the correlation between two measures—in the present case reading age and GPA—is equal to the proportion of shared factors among their determinants. What is your best guess about that proportion? My most optimistic guess is about 30%. Assuming this estimate, we have all we need to produce an unbiased prediction. Here are the directions for how to get there in four simple steps:</li>\n<li>Start with an estimate of average GPA.</li>\n<li>Determine the GPA that matches your impression of the evidence.</li>\n<li>Estimate the correlation between your evidence and GPA.</li>\n<li>If the correlation is .30, move 30% of the distance from the average to the matching GPA.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Despite the pitfalls of relying on the intuitions of System 1, System 2 cannot function without it.

A golfer will play for par rather than for birdies and contract negotiations stall to avoid one party making a concession. We judge companies as acting unfairly if they create a loss for the customer or employees to increase profits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prospect theory is based on the premise that people make judgments based on the pain that they feel from a loss. Since decisions are influenced by an emotional reaction, prospect theory and aversion loss are a result of System 1.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Loss aversion runs so deeply, it leads to the sunk cost fallacy. People will take further risks to try and recover from a large loss that has already happened.

It is an ever-present feature of negotiations, especially of renegotiations of an existing contract, the typical situation in labor negotiations and in international discussions of trade or arms limitations. The existing terms define reference points, and a proposed change in any aspect of the agreement is inevitably viewed as a concession that one side makes to the other. Loss aversion creates an asymmetry that makes agreements difficult to reach.

This is simply a cumbersome way of saying that some characteristics influence your assessment more than others do.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When we looked at our choices for bad options, we quickly realized that we were just as risk seeking in the domain of losses as we were risk averse in the domain of gains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Certainty effect</em>: at high probabilities, we seek to avoid loss and therefore accept worse outcomes in exchange for certainty, and take high risk in exchange for possibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Possibility effect</em>: at low probabilities, we seek a large gain despite risk, and avoid risk despite a poor outcome.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Indeed, we identified two reasons for this effect.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, there is diminishing sensitivity. The sure loss is very aversive because the reaction to a loss of $900 is more than 90% as intense as the reaction to a loss of $1,000.</li>\n<li>The second factor may be even more powerful: the decision weight that corresponds to a probability of 90% is only about 71, much lower than the probability.</li>\n<li>Many unfortunate human situations unfold in the top right cell. This is where people who face very bad options take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>According to prospect theory, we overestimate highly improbable outcomes. This is because System 1 is drawn to the emotions associated with a highly unlucky or lucky outcome.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>People become risk-averse to avoid an unlikely disappointment or seek out risk for the chance of an unlikely windfall.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For example, in scenarios with a 95% chance of winning, people will focus on the 5% chance of loss and choose a 100% win option with a lower value. They accept an unfavorable settlement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In scenarios with a 5% chance of a large gain, like the lottery, people will choose this option over a sure win of a small amount. They reject a reasonable settlement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rare events, like plane crashes, also tend to be overestimated according to prospect theory. This is partly because the improbable outcome is overestimated. It is also because the chance of the event not happening is difficult to calculate. System 1 applies its ‘what you see is what you get’ bias.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The probability of a rare event is most likely to be overestimated when the alternative is not fully specified.</li>\n<li>Emotion and vividness influence fluency, availability, and judgments of probability—and thus account for our excessive response to the few rare events that we do not ignore.</li>\n<li>Adding vivid details, salience and attention to a rare event will increase the weighting of an unlikely outcome.</li>\n<li>When this doesn’t occur, we tend to neglect the rare event</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"context\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#context\" aria-label=\"context permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Context</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In prospect theory, the context of how choices are presented affects our decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When people consider risk, they prefer to view choices one by one. The cumulative effect of decisions, which would give a better picture of overall risk, is more difficult to assess.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is System 1’s tendency to frame questions into the one with the most cognitive ease, and the ‘what you see is what you get’ bias.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, in a coin flip where you can lose $100 or win $200, you will win more money the more times you play, because the average outcome is to gain $50 each time.</li>\n<li>People that are asked if they would like to make five bets are more likely to accept than if people are asked on five separate occasions. They cannot consider the cumulative effect of many bets unless they are presented with it in a simple and obvious way.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The way that risk is presented can also provide a prime for a System 1 bias, especially if one option is associated with an emotional outcome like a loss.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, people were given two options for a medication program for a disease. One can save a third of the people who contract a disease, the second has a two-thirds probability that no one can be saved. The options are the same but most people will select the first.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Risk Policies</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There were two ways of construing decisions i and ii:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>narrow framing: a sequence of two simple decisions, considered separately</li>\n<li>broad framing: a single comprehensive decision, with four options</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Broad framing was obviously superior in this case.

The ‘experience self’ evaluates outcomes as they happen. The ‘remembering self’ evaluates the outcome after the event. The remembering self tends to have more power in decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The remembering self uses the peak-end rule, placing more importance on the end of an experience than any other part. It also suffers duration neglect, where the length of an experience is disregarded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In a study, people were given the option of two painful procedures. One lasts eight minutes and gradually increases in pain until the end. The second lasts twenty-four minutes and has the same intensity of pain but in the middle. Most people will choose the second procedure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The remembering self will also choose options that value the memory of an experience, more than the experience itself. Likewise, it will choose to suffer pain if that pain can be erased from memory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Asking people about overall life satisfaction is an important measure in many studies. But System 1 tends to replace this difficult question with an easier one. The remembering self answers about how they have felt recently.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kahneman proposes a better methodology for prompting the experience self. He has conducted studies that ask people to reconstruct their previous day. This gives a better measure of well-being and happiness and has resulted in better insights into how this is affected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Two Selves</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Peak-end rule</em>: The global retrospective rating was well predicted by the average of the level of pain reported at the worst moment of the experience and at its end.</li>\n<li>We tend to overrate the end of an experience when remembering the whole.</li>\n<li><em>Duration neglect</em>: The duration of the procedure had no effect whatsoever on the ratings of total pain.</li>\n<li>Generally: we tend to ignore the duration of an event when evaluating an experience.</li>\n<li>Confusing experience with the memory of it is a compelling cognitive illusion—and it is the substitution that makes us believe a past experience can be ruined.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Experienced Well-Being</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One way to improve experience is to shift from passive leisure (TV watching) to active leisure, including socializing and exercising.</li>\n<li>The second-best predictor of feelings of a day is whether a person did or did not have contacts with friends or relatives.</li>\n<li>It is only a slight exaggeration to say that happiness is the experience of spending time with people you love and who love you.</li>\n<li>Can money buy happiness? Being poor makes one miserable, being rich may enhance one’s life satisfaction, but does not (on average) improve experienced well-being.</li>\n<li>Severe poverty amplifies the effect of other misfortunes of life.</li>\n<li>The satiation level beyond which experienced well-being no longer increases was a household income of about $75,000 in high-cost areas (it could be less in areas where the cost of living is lower). The average increase of experienced well-being associated with incomes beyond that level was precisely zero.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking About Life</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Experienced well-being is on average unaffected by marriage, not because marriage makes no difference to happiness but because it changes some aspects of life for the better and others for the worse (how one’s time is spent).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One reason for the low correlations between individuals’ circumstances and their satisfaction with life is that both experienced happiness and life satisfaction are largely determined by the genetics of temperament. A disposition for well-being is as heritable as height or intelligence, as demonstrated by studies of twins separated at birth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The importance that people attached to income at age 18 also anticipated their satisfaction with their income as adults.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The people who wanted money and got it were significantly more satisfied than average; those who wanted money and didn’t get it were significantly more dissatisfied.

Our intelligence is contained in the collective mind and not the individual brain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To emphasise the point, our knowledge as individuals are intertwined with the knowledge of others. Since our beliefs and attitudes are shaped by communities, there becomes a tendency for us to associate with one prescription or another.

This is possible because our world usually conforms to generally consistent principles. We can also think of the brain as one part of a larger processing system. It combines with the body and the external environment (an outside memory store) to remember, reason and interact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complex behaviours emerge when individual systems can interact or coordinate with each other. Multiple cognitive systems that work together may give rise to a group intelligence that exceeds the capability of any one individual. This is the case with bees, ants and humans. The growth in our collective intelligence for example can be attributed to the growing size and complexity of our social groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The human brain didn’t evolve to store information and the world is extremely complex</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the predominant theory among cognitive scientists was that the brain was basically a sort of organic computer.</li>\n<li>in the 1980s, a pioneering cognitive scientist named Thomas Landauer turned this model on its head. Landauer figured that, if the brain’s main job was to carry out computer-like functions – things like storing and processing information – then it would be informative to estimate the size of human knowledge in computational terms. Hi experiments proves an important point: our brains, unlike computers, are not designed to function primarily as repositories of knowledge because there is, quite simply, too much of it. The world is an infinitely complex place. For example, did you know that there’s not a person alive who understands all there is to know about modern airplanes? They’re simply far too complicated, and understanding them completely requires a team of specialists.</li>\n<li>This raises yet another tricky question: what did our brains evolve to do?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The human brain evolved for action, and diagnostic reasoning may be what differentiates us from other animals.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What’s the difference between a Venus flytrap and a jellyfish? Sure, one lives on land, traps bugs and is capable of photosynthesis, while the other floats around in the water, has tentacles and looks bizarre – but what makes them fundamentally different?\n<ul>\n<li>Well, one of them is capable of action, and the other is not. This difference is profound, because the ability of organisms to act on and interact with their environment is what led to the evolution of the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the more neurons an animal has, the more complex the actions it’s capable of.</li>\n<li>Humans possess billions of neurons. We can travel to space and compose concertos. But we evolved such complex brains for the same reason that jellyfish evolved their rudimentary system of neurons: to enable effective action.</li>\n<li>So if all brains evolved to assist action, what (besides billions more neurons) differentiates humans from other, less neuronally endowed animals? Well, one answer might be our ability to engage in causal reasoning.</li>\n<li>Not only can we reason forward, predicting how today’s actions may shape tomorrow’s events; we can also reason backward, explaining how today’s affairs may have been caused by yesterday’s actions. This is called diagnostic reasoning, and although we’re by no means perfect at it, our ability to do it is arguably what sets us apart from other sentient creatures.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When trying to answer a question or solve a problem, people engage in one of two kinds of reasoning. Either they use <strong>intuition</strong>, or they use <strong>deliberation</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use intuition all the time because it’s sufficient for day-to-day purposes. But when things get more complicated – when we have to draw a bicycle rather than just ride it, for example – intuition breaks down.</li>\n<li>if you paused before shouting out the answer and were able to work out the correct answer, then you might be one of those rare creatures: a person who favors deliberation over intuition.</li>\n<li>Such people are highly reflective and, unlike most of us, yearn for detail. They are also less likely to exhibit any illusion of explanatory depth. It’s not that they know more; it’s that they’re aware of how little they know. They’re probably no better than most people at drawing a bicycle, but they know that they can’t do it.</li>\n<li>Intuitions are subjective – they are yours alone. Deliberations, on the other hand, require engagement with a community of fellow knowledge possessors. Even if you deliberate in solitude, you’ll converse with yourself as though talking to someone else. This is just one of the many ways that we externalize internal thought processes to assist cognition.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>We think with our bodies and the world around us.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may not be a philosopher (most people aren’t), but you’re probably familiar with René Descartes’s famous words, Cogito, ergo sum: “I think, therefore I am.” Descartes believed that our ability to think, not our physical body, is what determines our identity, and that engaging in thought is distinct from physical activities.</li>\n<li>This Cartesian emphasis on the preeminence of thought contributed to a faulty assumption made by early cognitive scientists, namely that thought is carried out in the mind alone.</li>\n<li>As we learn more about the mind, however, it appears that, when thinking, we also employ our bodies and the world around us, using them as tools to assist our everyday calculations and cogitations.</li>\n<li>In general, we assume that the world will continue to behave as it always has. We assume that the sun will rise and that what goes up must come down. This enables us to store a great deal of information in the world. You don’t need to remember every particular detail of your living room because, in order to remind yourself what’s there, you only need to take a look.</li>\n<li>We also use the world to help us make complex computations, rather than conducting them in our head.</li>\n<li>We also use our bodies and physical actions to aid thought. This is called embodiment, and its proponents assert that thought is not an entirely abstract process that plays out inside your head.</li>\n<li>For example, children learning to count almost always use their fingers. And adults almost always find it easier to do math problems and spell words with the help of pen and paper.</li>\n<li>Along similar lines, our emotions function as a sort of memory bank. We don’t need to memorize a long list of substances that we ought to avoid touching or consuming, for example, because we simply feel disgust when we encounter a puddle of fetid water or a pile of feces. In this way, physical or emotional responses fill in for knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"knowledge-and-intentionality\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#knowledge-and-intentionality\" aria-label=\"knowledge and intentionality permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Knowledge and intentionality</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our ability to distribute and share knowledge and intentionality allows us to pursue common goals collaboratively. This ability, combined with our capacity to communicate arbitrarily complex ideas through language, helps us to store and transfer knowledge between generations. Fernbach suggests that this is what separates us from artificial intelligence and most other biological species.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Our success as a species is the result of collective intelligence and the ability to collaborate.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have you ever wondered how our brains got so big? Why did we, unlike all other animals, evolve intelligence so sophisticated that it enabled us to outsmart and prey on larger, fiercer creatures, like mammoths and bison?</li>\n<li>Well, the most compelling theory is called the social brain hypothesis.</li>\n<li>It essentially argues that big brains are the result of communal living. Living with one another and collaborating on certain projects (such as hunting mammoths) exerted new mental demands on our ancestors – demands that they then evolved to meet.</li>\n<li>When Homo sapiens first emerged, their brains were already quite complex; living in groups, however, made us expert collaborators. And it was this collaborative ability that led to the development of another crucial skill: the division of cognitive labor.</li>\n<li><em>division of cognitive labor</em> is possible because of shared intentionality. Each worker can collaborate with all the others because everyone shares the same intention: building a house.</li>\n<li>Humanity’s greatest accomplishments, from smartphones to space exploration, are the result of these two abilities: the division of cognitive labor and shared intentionality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"cumulative-cultures\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#cumulative-cultures\" aria-label=\"cumulative cultures permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cumulative cultures</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A cumulative culture can form with the transmission of knowledge, division of labour and model for cooperation.

Most of what we know comes from what we are told and understand superficially. This usually suffices because communities can divide cognitive labour and responsibilities. A corollary of all this is the automation paradox. As we become more dependent on technology and automated systems, our ability to navigate new situations diminishes if or when such systems fail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Machines can’t share intentionality and it’s unlikely that a superintelligence will emerge.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Technology has become so advanced that we treat it more like a living organism than the tool it really is.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>People have evolved to use tools. We naturally use objects as though they were extensions of our bodies. When you write with a pen, for instance, you’re aware of the pressure of the nib on the paper, not the pressure of your fingers on the pen. But technology isn’t like most tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Indeed, it’s so complex that it seems lifelike; our phones talk to us and our laptops automatically install mysterious updates. And technology’s lifelike quality fools us into thinking that it, like other people, can share our intentions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More worrisome is our over-reliance on machines that, though sophisticated, aren’t actually very bright.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>We can avoid groupthink by thinking causally and politicians simplify matters by appealing to sacred values.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The horrors of the twentieth century have baffled historians and social scientists for decades. How could so many normal citizens support dictators such as Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong and Adolf Hitler – men whose policies and politics led to the deaths of millions of innocent people?</li>\n<li>Well, one reason is groupthink, a term used by the social psychologist Irving Janis. Groupthink is the tendency of communities (or a sufficient majority of their members) to uncritically arrive at a consensus on a particular issue. When everyone around you believes the same thing, it’s difficult to believe something else. This is what happened in Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany and Communist China – and, clearly, its effects can be catastrophic.</li>\n<li>So how can we avoid falling victim to groupthink ourselves?</li>\n<li>One way is to fully understand the policies promoted by modern-day politicians – or, at the very least, to know how little you understand about them.</li>\n<li>So promoting causal understanding may be a way to bridge political divides; however, there are some beliefs that no amount of causal explanation can dislodge.</li>\n<li>Take abortion. Pro-lifers don’t really consider the effects of antiabortion laws. They simply believe that killing a human fetus is wrong. With similar intractableness, pro-choicers believe that women should have the final say in what happens to their bodies.</li>\n<li>Such beliefs are based on sacred values, which are all but impossible to alter. There’s nothing wrong with that, but beware: politicians often use the language of sacred values to promote policies that deserve closer scrutiny.</li>\n<li>A drawn-out speech about the complex geopolitical effects of placing sanctions on Iran is unlikely to win votes. So politicians simplify matters, using a barrage of bromides about shared values to distract voters from actual policy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"redefining-intelligence\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#redefining-intelligence\" aria-label=\"redefining intelligence permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Redefining intelligence</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Intelligence is not necessarily a personal attribute, or one marked by academic success. In a community of knowledge, it is how much an individual contributes to a group’s success. Teams with complementary skills are more likely to divide and use cognitive labour successfully than teams with homogeneous skills. For this reason, education is not purely about the development of intellectual independence. It is also learning about what we don’t know, where we fit within our community of knowledge, and how to separate accurate statements from garbage and noise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>neither Martin Luther King nor Albert Eistein worked alone. Each benefited from a rich network of collaborators. And each stood on the shoulders of the hard-working individuals who’d come before.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We forget this because the whole story is far too complex for most of us to remember in great detail. Their names function as a sort of shorthand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This leads to a problem, however. Most of us begin to believe the simplified story – that a small cohort of individual geniuses are responsible for history’s great deeds and discoveries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remember, we didn’t evolve to be repositories of knowledge. Nor did we evolve to work in a vacuum. As has already been argued, we evolved to divide cognitive labor and collaborate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new definition of smart would take these abilities into account. So, rather than merely measuring a person’s IQ, we ought to assess her ability to contribute to group tasks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We should also encourage collaborative abilities in school by eschewing lectures and introducing hands-on activities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most people’s view of education is quite limited. Attending school isn’t all about memorizing facts. After graduation, one shouldn’t necessarily possess more knowledge than one’s undergraduate self. What one should possess is the ability to engage in collaborative enterprises.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The purpose of education isn’t only to pass on knowledge; it’s also to remind people of their ignorance. After all, once you’re aware of how little you know, you’ll be much more likely to seek help from the community of knowledge possessors that you’re a part of.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>That’s not only an invaluable skill.

However, scientific progress is often built upon prior conclusions held by authority inside the community of knowledge.

This is easy to see as well in scientific history (think Galileo).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Again, the authors highlight how personal beliefs and reasoning are often interconnected with the beliefs, cultural values and identities of our communities. As social creatures, it is difficult to be perfectly rational or scientific in every mode of process and reasoning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Furthermore, since we often don’t know enough to analyse the consequences of new policy or science, we have little choice but to depend on the views of people we trust. This relies on faith that others are telling the truth. However, this faith is different to that of religious faith due to the power and threat of verification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fernbach and Sloman suggests that it is this distinction or social pressure that incentivises scientists to pursue truth-seeking within their community of knowledge. This ‘incentive’, in combination with the process of falsification, allows us to advance the frontiers of knowledge in an adaptive process, even if we stumble with errors and mistaken beliefs along the way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fear of new developments can lead to anti-scientific sentiment, which is hard to reverse.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The geneticist Walter Bodmer proposed that people fear new technologies because they don’t understand them.

It’s why we sometimes hold strong opinions without a detailed understanding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since we rely on simple causal models and our community of knowledge, our beliefs and confidence often go untested.

It is the natural state of humanity. There is simply too much complexity in this universe for any one individual to fully understand. As such, we do what we know and ignore what we have little conception of. Ignorance shapes our lives because we have little awareness of what is truly possible. At the same time, it is the illusion of knowledge that gives some people the self-confidence to pursue new and risky frontiers. Perhaps some illusions are necessary for the development and progress of civilisation itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.

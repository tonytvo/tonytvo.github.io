The “magic” need to create mocks could cause the knowledge to leak between components.\n<ul>\n<li>if we can keep knowledge local to an object (either internal or passed in), then its implementation is independent of its context.

Only catch exceptions in a test if we want to assert something about them.</li>\n<li>delegate to subordinate objects as mentioned in the programming by intention</li>\n<li>assertions and expectations\n<ul>\n<li>the assertions and expectations of a test should communicate precisely what matters in the behaviour of the target code.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Avoid magic numbers with no clear cause-effect relationship.\n<ul>\n<li>literal values without explanation can be difficult to understand because the programmer has to interpret whether a particular value is significant or just an arbitrary placeholder to trace behaviour (e.g. should be doubled and passed on to a peer).</li>\n<li>allocate literal values to variables and constants with names that describe their function.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>removing duplication</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>remove duplication at the point of use\n<ul>\n<li>change tests’ emphasis to what behaviour exexpected, rather than how the test is implemented.</li>\n<li>extract some of the behaviour into builder objects and end up with a declarative description of what the feature does.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>we’re nudging the test code towards the sort of language we could use when discussing the feature with someone else, even someone non-technical.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>we push everything else into supporting code.</strong></li>\n<li>describe the intention of a feature, not just a sequence of steps to drive it.</li>\n<li>using these techniques, we can use higher-level tests to communicate directly with non-technical stakeholders, such as business analysts. We can use the tests to help us narrow down exactly what a feature should do, and why.</li>\n<li>there are other tools that are designed to foster collaboration across the technical and non-technical members of a team such as FIT, Cucumber.</li>\n<li>avoid reasserting behaviour that is covered in other tests</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>test diagnostics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>design to fail informatively.: the point of a test is not to pass but to fail. If a failing test clearly explains what has failed and why we can quickly diagnose and correct the code.</li>\n<li>we want to avoid situations when we can’t diagnose a test failure that has happened. The last thing we should have to do is crack open the debugger and step through the tested code to find the point of disagreement.</li>\n<li>not too inhibited about dropping code and trying again. Sometimes, it’s quicker to roll back and restart with a clear head than to keep digging</li>\n<li>if the test is small, focused and has readable names, it should tell us most of what we need to know about what has gone wrong.</li>\n<li>explanatory assertion messages\n<ul>\n<li>the failure message should describe the cause rather than the symptom.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>highlight details with matches. The matcher API includes support for describing the value that is mismatched, to help with understanding exactly what is different.</li>\n<li>self-describing value: build the detail into values in the assertion. If we have to add detail to an assertion, maybe that’s a hint that we could make the failure more obvious.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">expected: &lt;a customer account id> but was &lt;id not set>\nuse new Date(timeValue) {public String toString() {return name; })\nexpected: &lt;startDate>, got &lt;endDate></code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>obviously canned value\n<ul>\n<li>conventions for common values can ensure that it stands out???</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>tracer object\n<ul>\n<li>dummy object that has no supported behaviour of its own, except to describe its role when something fails.</li>\n<li>Jmock can accept a name when creating a mock object that will be used in failure reporting.

Start at the lowest levels of your logic layer and choose a single method that depends on one clearly-defined piece of infrastructure.\n<ul>\n<li>If the infrastructure code is intertwingled with the Logic code, dis-intertwingled it by factoring out an infrastructure wrapper.</li>\n<li>The method will act similarly to an application layer class: it will have a mix of logic and calls to infrastructure. Make this code easier to refactor by rewriting its tests to use Nullable Infrastructure dependencies instead of mocks. Then factor all the logic code into methods with no infrastructure dependencies.</li>\n<li>At this point, your original method will have nothing left but a small “Logic Sandwich: a call or 2 to the infrastructure class and a call to the new logic method. Now eliminate the original method by inlining it to its callers’. This will cause the logic sandwich to climb one step up your dependency chain.</li>\n<li>At that point, review its design and refactor as desired to better fit the “Logic Patterns” and your application’s needs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Climbing the ladder takes a lot of time and effort, so do it gradually, as part of your regular work, rather than all at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus your efforts on code where testing without mocks will have noticeable benefits. Don’t waste time refactoring code that’s already easy to maintain, regardless of whether it uses mocks.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Easily visible behaviour</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>logic layer computation can only be tested if the computation results are visible to tests</li>\n<li>Prefer pure functions where possible. Pure functions’ return values are determined only by their input parameters.</li>\n<li>Where pure functions aren’t possible, choose immutable objects. The state of immutable objects is determined when the object is constructed and never changes afterwards.</li>\n<li>Avoid writing code that explicitly depends on (or changes) the state of dependencies more than one level deep. Instead, design dependencies, so they encapsulate entirely their next-level-down dependencies</li>\n<li>avoid getter/setter for objects, move any behaviour that uses getter/setter into the objects</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Testable Libraries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>3rd party code doesn’t always have easily visible behaviour. It also introduces breaking API changes with new releases or simply stops being maintained.</li>\n<li>Wrap third-party code in the code that you control.</li>\n<li>Write the wrapper’s API to match the needs of your application, not the third-party code, and add methods as needed to provide easily visible behaviour. This typically involves writing query methods to expose deeply-buries state in terms of the domain that your application needs.</li>\n<li>When the third-party code introduces a breaking change, or needs to be replaced, modify the wrapper, so no other code is affected.</li>\n<li>Frameworks and libraries with sprawling API(s) are more difficult to wrap, so prefer libraries that have a narrowly-defined purpose and a simple API</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the third-party code interfaces with an external system, use an Infrastructure Wrapper.</p>\n<h2>infrastructure wrappers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>for each external system - service, database, file system, or even environment variables, create one wrapper class responsible for interfacing with that system.</li>\n<li>Design your wrappers to provide a crisp, clean view of the messy outside world.</li>\n<li>Design your infrastructure classes to stand alone in whatever format is most beneficial to the Logic and Application layers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>focused integration tests</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>test your external communication against a production-like environment. For file system code, check that it reads and writes actual files. For databases and services, access an entire database or service.</li>\n<li>Run your focused integration tests against test systems that are reserved exclusively for one machine’s use. It’s best to run locally on your development machine and start and stopped y your test or build script. If you share test systems with other developers, you’ll experience unpredictable test failures when multiple people run the test simultaneously.</li>\n<li>Use a spy server when you can’t integrate it into the external system.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fake it once you make it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>some high-level infrastructure classes depend on low-level infrastructure.</li>\n<li>For tests that check if external communication is done correctly, use a focused integration test (and possibly a spy server).</li>\n<li>For parsing and processing, use more direct and faster nullable infrastructure dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Paranoic telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>external systems are unreliable. The only sure thing is their eventual failure.</li>\n<li>Test that every failure case either logs an error or sends an alert. Also, test for the requests that hang too.</li>\n<li>Whenever possible, use testable libraries/adapters rather than external services</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Zero impact instantiation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>overlapping sociable tests could instantiate a web of dependencies that take too long or cause - side effects. The tests could be slow, difficult to set up or fail unpredictably</li>\n<li>don’t do significant work in the constructor.</li>\n<li>Don’t connect to external systems, start services, or perform long calculations.</li>\n<li>For code that needs to connect to an external system or start a service, provide a connect or start() method.</li>\n<li>For the need to perform a long calculation, consider lazy initialization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Parameterless instantiation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ensures that all logic classes can be constructed without providing any parameters (without using a DI framework).</strong></li>\n<li>In practice, this means that most objects instantiate their dependencies in their constructor by default, although they may also accept them as optional parameters.</li>\n<li>If parameterless constructor won’t make any sense, provide a test-only factory method. The - factory method should provide overridable defaults for mandatory parameters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The factory method is easiest to maintain if it’s located next to the actual constructors in the production code. It should be marked as test-specific and straightforward enough to not need tests of its own.</p>\n<h2>Collaborator-Based Isolation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>call dependencies’ methods to help define test expectations.</li>\n<li>For example, if you’re testing an InventoryReport that includes an address in its header, don’t hardcode “123 Main St.” as your expectation for the report header test. Instead, call Address. renderAsOneLine() as part of defining your test expectation.</li>\n<li>collaborator-based isolation allows you to change features without modifying a lot of tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>embedded stub</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>used to provide nullable infrastructure for tests and avoid duplicating the null checks all over the place</strong>.</li>\n<li>Stub out the third-party library that performs external communication rather than changing your infrastructure code.</li>\n<li>Put the stub in the same file as your infrastructure code, so it’s easy to remember and update when your infrastructure code changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>signature shielding</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>to avoid changing method signatures when you refactor the application</li>\n<li>First, encapsulate the methods with proxy or factory methods. Then, program the proxies and factories, so their parameters are all optional.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>configurable response</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>allow infrastructure methods’ responses to be configured with an optional “responses” parameter to the Nullable Infrastructure’s createNull() factory.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> loginClient <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> LoginClient<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createNull</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n    validateLogin<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// configure the validateLogin response</span>\n      email<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"my_authenticated_email\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      emailVerified<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>Send State</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>application and high-level infrastructure code use their infrastructure dependencies to send data to external systems. They need a way of checking that the data was sent.</li>\n<li>For infrastructure methods that send data and provide a way to observe that data was sent, use <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/domain-oriented-observability.html#DomainProbesEnableCleanerMore-focusedTests\">domain-oriented observability</a>. Prefer using observer patterns like Send Events.</li>\n<li>If you need more than one send result or can’t store the transmitted data, use “Send Events” To test code that uses infrastructure to get data, use Configurable Responses. To test code that responds to infrastructure events uses “Behavior Simulation.”.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Send Events</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>when you test code that uses infrastructure dependencies to send large blobs of data or sends data multiple times in a row. “Send State” will consume too much memory.</li>\n<li>Use an observer pattern to emit an event when your infrastructure code sends data. Include data as part of the event payload.</li>\n<li>When tests need to assert the sent data, they can listen for the events.</li>\n<li>Create a helper function that listens for sent events and stores their data in an array to make your tests easier to read.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Behaviour simulation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>some external systems will push data to you rather than waiting for you to ask for it.</li>\n<li>Therefore, your application and high-level infrastructure code need a way to test what happens when their infrastructure dependencies generate those events.</li>\n<li>Add methods to your infrastructure code that simulate receiving an event from an external system. Share as much code as possible with the code that handles actual external events while remaining convenient for tests to use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>References</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/code.html\">http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/code.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Listen to tests, test smells and patterns","date":"December 20, 2021","description":"listen to tests, test smells and patterns"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/growing-object-orented-guided-by-tests-summary/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Growing object oriented guided by tests summary"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tools-of-titans/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"tools of titans summary"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8c6ee45b-c5fd-53b2-b876-3bb4eaea00dd","previousPostId":"df65a369-42a7-51f0-80fa-ce1671f09e67","nextPostId":"6103d821-51e7-502c-8dfd-3c811a7d05c6"}},

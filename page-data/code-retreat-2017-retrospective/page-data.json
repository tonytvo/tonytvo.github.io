IT’S SO NOT TRUE? It does contain many behaviors of the systems, some behaviors are at very low level and business people shouldn’t care about, but I believe <strong>MOST OF THE BEHAVIORS</strong> could and should be expressed at <strong>high level domain language</strong> and can be used as <strong>executable documentation</strong> for different stakeholders such as QA/Non technical people. Should we call those tests as behavior unit tests instead of unit tests?</p>\n<p>How can we make the TDD/Refactor/agile practices easier for people to adapt?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maybe, <strong>shrink the change?</strong></li>\n<li>Maybe, there’s lots of things can go wrong but there’s few things that you got to get it right, so <strong>script critical moves?</strong></li>\n<li>Maybe, Looking for bright spot (examples) so people can see the benefits and <strong>start small?</strong></li>\n<li>Maybe, <strong>tweak the environments</strong> to encourage the right behavior and discourage the wrong behavior?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think code retreat is one of the good place for me to find the answer to that question.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Code Retreat 2017 Retrospective","date":"December 06, 2017","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/yet-another-interpretation-pyramid-tests/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Yet another interpretation of pyramid tests"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/what-simple-way-share-learn-refactor/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What's a simple way to share and learn refactor"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"49d35b87-15fd-5518-a461-15f57d4167d1","previousPostId":"36823c89-3efe-5113-8a1f-520b34e106e1","nextPostId":"9943582b-5efb-5887-9b55-c29bb390d880"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}

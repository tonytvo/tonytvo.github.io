So Tell Yourself Too.</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>t’s hard to imagine any situation that you would describe to your kid as hopeless. “Sorry, it’s too late, you’re a failure” is something no parent would ever say. If they were falling behind their peers in math, you’d tell them that it was just a matter of work and time. If they were trying to write themselves off as a baseball player, you’d tell them about how many athletes were late bloomers, that they are still so young, that next year they can come back stronger and better, that they can turn things around. Even if they had a cancer diagnosis with terrible odds, you’d be encouraging them to fight, to never give up, to prove the  doubters wrong.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You wouldn’t just be saying this. You’d <strong>mean</strong> it. Because it’s true. Nothing is fixed in this life that you haven’t fixed yourself. Nothing is permanent. Especially when the person, deep down, is good and decent and full of potential.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Okay. So why are you whispering the exact opposite of this to yourself? Telling yourself that you’ve just got to accept that your dreams are done. Telling yourself, I used to be in good shape—but that’s in the past.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No! It’s never too late. You still have so much time in front of you. So much ability, so much potential to fulfill. You decide the rest of the story. It’s up to you. But this is the important part: the story you decide for yourself is also going to determine what kind of stories your kids believe. Your story is the compass and the map on the journey that will lead them to realism, optimism, skepticism, cynicism, or fatalism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Which will it be?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"you-have-to-face-your-flaws\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#you-have-to-face-your-flaws\" aria-label=\"you have to face your flaws permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>You Have to Face Your Flaws</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to be a great parent, you’re going to have to deal with your crap.

The other you don’t.” It was simple advice: work hard, very hard, at those things I can control and don’t lose sleep over the rest of it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As you put your kid out there in softball or on the debate team, as you talk to them about their class rank or their mile time, make sure that you are letting them know that how they compare with other people is far less important than how they measure up against <strong>their own potential</strong>. Somebody who gives their best effort at everything they do is going to go much further in life (and have a happier one) than somebody who is obsessed with coming in first place or who never earnestly tries for fear that they will lose.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>So tell your kid to be the <strong>best they can be</strong>.

He writes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In contests with his comrades we ought not to allow him to become sulky or fly into a passion: let us see that he be on friendly terms with those whom he contends with, so that in the struggle itself he may learn to wish not to hurt his antagonist but to conquer him: Whenever he has gained the day or done something praiseworthy, we should allow him to enjoy his victory, but not to rush into transports of delight: for joy leads to exultation, and exultation leads to swaggering and excessive self-esteem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is important. We want our kids to possess the will to win, but not so much that it possesses them. We want them to feel good when they win, without being so dependent or addicted to that feeling that they are crushed when, inevitably, they lose. We don’t want their success to fuel their ego, or their shortcomings on the field to lead to insecurity or self-loathing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is, like all things, about balance.

They might have bounced around to two or three places, had multiple disappointing seasons, and then suddenly, when the environment around them is right, when they have the support they need, bam, they’re great.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>His point was this: if even athletes being paid millions of dollars to perform need this, how can we possibly just expect kids to succeed in any old classroom we drop them into? We are so quick to write kids off—even our own kids—as not good at math, as a so-so student, as having trouble focusing or whatever.

No, when things aren’t working, they invest more. They don’t blame the star. They blame the system… and then try to fix it.

Books carry us across oceans and centuries, she writes, with the extra benefit of making us feel less alone. Stephen King’s line was that books are “uniquely portable magic.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>That said, we need to be providing a good example. How often do your kids catch you reading? How often do they see you with a book in your hands? You want them to read, but do you read regularly to them? You tell them that books are important, that books are fun, but where is the evidence?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want your kids to read more, if you want them to walk through those magical door-shaped portals, show them what a reader looks like. Talk to them about books.

We’ve talked to other parents about what grade level they’re reading or doing math at and what percentile they’re in statewide. We’ve obsessed over GPA and standardized test scores as if they were keys to the kingdom… of what exactly? Then we grill our college kids about whether they found their major yet, about whether the major they picked is going to snag them a high-paying job or not.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You want kids who are in this for life, who don’t think in zero-sum terms.

He was a POW in World War I. He had to flee France in order to save it in World War II. He endured protests and assassination attempts. He also had a daughter named Anne, who was born with Down syndrome. In 1928, when she was born, this was not something people knew how to deal with—disabled children were often sent away to institutions. Parents were made to feel ashamed, as if they were responsible for having, in the language of the day, a “retarded” child.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But not de Gaulle and his wife, Yvonne. They embraced their daughter. They built their lives around the challenging but rewarding experience of raising her. “Her birth was a trial for my wife and myself,” he said. “But believe me, Anne is my joy and my strength. She is the grace of God in my life… . She has kept me in the security of obedience to the sovereign will of God.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each of our children is different. Each comes with their own limitations, challenges, and personality. Whether they are seriously handicapped, have a minor learning disability, or bring into our lives this or that, it doesn’t matter.

What do you think I am, an Uber driver? It’s understandable—it can be a pain to drive your kids around. To school. To a friend’s house. To football practice. Sometimes it can feel like this is all parenting is—driving a little person around… for free.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But instead of seeing this as an obligation, see it as a gift. For a bunch of reasons. First off, twenty minutes in the car can be something you share and remember forever.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second, how often do you get this kind of captive audience? You guys are stuck together! This is wonderful. This is what you wanted, right? An opportunity to connect? To bond? To have fun? So use it!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Third, as many parents with older kids will tell you, something changes when kids are in the car with you. Suddenly, you’re not the parent. You’re just a companion. Kids will share and say things in the car they wouldn’t say anywhere else. Or better, if their friends are with them in the car too, you fade into the background and suddenly get to watch how your kid is with other people. You’ll learn things about your own son or daughter that you’d never know otherwise. You’ll get a glimpse into who they are in a way they could never articulate to you directly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The point is: driving your kids around is a privilege. It’s an opportunity. Don’t complain about it. If anything, volunteer to do it!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"youll-want-them-close\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#youll-want-them-close\" aria-label=\"youll want them close permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>You’ll Want Them Close</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We all want great things for our children… but most of all, especially when we’re older, we’re going to want them to be close to us.

So they walk out of the apartment, down the hall to the elevator, into and then and out of the elevator, and across the lobby to the front door, where they would start the walk. And as Alexandra went to check in with her baby boy, she suddenly realized… that the walk had begun all the way back inside the apartment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To a kid, the world is a very different place from the one we live in and walk through and, if we’re being honest, take for granted. This has more to do with their size and their inexperience than anything else, but that doesn’t invalidate their opinions and impressions. If anything, it opens a new window for us to look at the world through, as it did for Alexandra. It reminds us of how we felt about new things when we were their age. It is an antidote to cynicism and world-weariness.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As parents, we have to appreciate the fact that our kids can help us see the world maybe better than we can help them see it. They can help us see that anything can be special and fun, that a walk doesn’t have to be outside, that dinner can be anywhere and a cardboard box can be more fun than the Christmas present it was carrying. We have to encourage this spirit. We have to make sure we don’t crush it with subtle corrections and insistence on the “official” way things are or should be. Most of all, we have to learn from their perspective and add it as much as possible to our own lives.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"they-help-you-notice-things\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#they-help-you-notice-things\" aria-label=\"they help you notice things permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>They Help You Notice Things</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Nothing cultivates your eye quite like games of “I Spy” in the car.

It’s “Be not afraid.” Over and over again these words appear. They’re a warning from on high to “be strong and of good courage,” as we hear in the book of Joshua. “Do not be afraid nor be dismayed.” A similar chord is struck in much of ancient Greek mythology. Some version of “Be brave,” “Have courage,” “Don’t be scared,” appears more than a dozen times in the Odyssey. It doesn’t matter which religion or philosophy or great mind you turn to, you will find courage in the same place the Stoics held it: at the top of the list of virtues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is impossible to be a good parent without having courage or cultivating courage in our kids. After all, it is the environment we create for them, the values we teach them, the rules we give them, and the bonds we forge with them that will give them the courage to do and be the things they were destined to accomplish and become.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remember Barack Obama’s observation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What makes you a man is not the ability to have a child, but the courage to raise one.

The problem, then, is not that conflicts happen; it is how we handle them when they occur, how we let these disagreements and miscommunications take on a life of their own. As Bruce Springsteen sings in “Tucson Train”:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>We fought hard over nothin’</em></li>\n<li><em>We fought till nothin’ remained</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But more hauntingly, he talks about how long he ended up carrying that nothin’ — something we’re all guilty of. So much of the stuff we get upset about doesn’t even matter.. and then because we get upset about it, we end up saying things that do matter and can never be unsaid. We fight over nothing and destroy everything we care about most.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will want a crowded table when you’re old, we’ve said. Well, that’s going to require some delayed gratification now. Some restraint now. It means letting things go. It means admitting you were wrong. It means telling your kids, your spouse, your own parents, that you’re sorry. It means accepting apologies from them too. It means showing them how to patch things up with their siblings, with other people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We can’t let arguments take on lives of their own and risk their taking the</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>joy out of our lives.

S. LEWIS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One of the great things about being a parent—if you do it right—is that it’s very humbling. No one knows how to cut you down to size quite like your kids. They don’t care how rich, how important, how respected you are. To them, you’re a goober. To them, you’re unfunny, old, and hopelessly uncool. You’re someone they can make fun of. In fact, you’re who they practice their sense of humor on. They’re not impressed with how much you paid for the hotel room—they want to know if there is a swimming pool. They don’t care how trendy a restaurant is—they hate that it doesn’t have chicken fingers. They don’t want you to drop them off in front of school, and they don’t think you’re clever. They suspect you don’t have any idea what you’re talking about.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“No man is a hero to his valet” goes the old expression. Plenty of parents are heroes to their kids, of course, but no one is exempt from their children’suncanny ability to size them up and cut them down from time to time.

Kids are not a burden or an impediment to success. They help us. They give us purpose and clarity and, most important, balance. The great Lin-Manuel Miranda and his wife had their first child just two weeks before the first rehearsals of his smash play Hamilton. You might think that this was a disruption or a distraction, but in fact it was the opposite. Miranda told the filmmaker Judd Apatow in the book Sicker in the Head that Hamilton might not have succeeded without this life event, and Miranda himself might not have been able to withstand the success either. Having an infant at home wasn’t a distraction; it forced him to ignore distraction. “I had to say no to ninety percent of it,” Miranda says of all the offers and party invites that came his way, “because… I had to sleep eight hours and I knew I was gonna wake up twice and change diapers. My family really saved my</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ass, because I think that’s how you lose it.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>So actually maybe family does hold you back … from getting in trouble. From biting off more than you can chew. From thinking you’re bigger or more important than you are. It holds you down… to reality, to what actually matters. It makes you realize that you’re loved, that you’re enough. And as it happens, all of this can make you better at what you do.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"its-an-honor-to-do-this\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#its-an-honor-to-do-this\" aria-label=\"its an honor to do this permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>It’s an Honor to Do This</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>These might not feel like particularly meaningful gestures of respect and love, but they are.

Not just the basic necessities but all sorts of extras. Because of you, your kids have a swimming pool. They have nice vacations. They have a big TV downstairs with lots of channels.

Now that you’re older, now that you have kids, all you want is presence. All you want is for your kids to be present over the holidays.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paul Orfalea, the founder of Kinkos, is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. When asked about his wealth, Orfalea didn’t talk about buying expensive stuff or building a great company or taking exotic vacations. He said, “Do you know what success is? Success is when your children want to be with you when they’re adults. How many people have all the [material stuff], and their kids don’t come home for the holidays? Come on.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Success, as we’ve talked about before, is having a crowded table. At the end of your life, success as a parent will be a family that comes together, that spends time together, that wants to be around you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>So here on Christmas, and throughout this holiday season, take some time to think about what it will take to have that. Think about the choices you’re making with your kids now so that they’ll choose to fly from their homes to yours when they’re older and have families of their own. Think about the gifts you have to give them today—your love, your support, your presence— to receive the gift of a crowded table in the future.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"forever-young\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#forever-young\" aria-label=\"forever young permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Forever Young</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One of the reasons some kids are so unprepared for the real world is that parents see the sweetness and innocence of a kid and think, I want to keep them like this forever. They felt like their own childhood was too short, and so they seek to extend childhood for their children for as long as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s an understandable impulse, but it’s also a kind of contradiction. Instead of enjoying how special their kid is in that moment, the parent is thinking both about the future (their own) and about the past (their own) and trying to figure out how to protect their kids from them. Instead of being present, instead of seizing and drinking in right now, they are futilely trying to hold back a tide that no one—not even the most dedicated parent—can stop: time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want your kid to be forever young, enjoy this moment here in front of you. Experience it fully right now. Don’t give even a thought to what lies around the bend. Because you know what you’ll find?

There’s an old expression: “Give me the first six years of a child’s life and you can have the rest.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Imagine generations of parents who did exactly the opposite of this. No wonder the past was so horrible… and people did such horrible things to each other. The first thing their parents did to them was horrible! They severed the first, most important bond a child has—the familial bond.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And think about what this cost them! Yes, kids are difficult when they’re young, but it’s also when they’re the most fun, the most innocent, the absolute cutest. So why are we so busy? Why are we working so much? Trying to have it all—cramming in all the old things we used to do before we had kids while we ask our parents to watch our children for us? We tell ourselves that when our kids are old we’ll make more time for them, we’ll</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>have more freedom—and besides, they’ll appreciate it more when they’re older.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No!

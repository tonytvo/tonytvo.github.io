And this is where things start to fall apart.

He believes that if you can learn how to connect the two, then success will follow. It’s important to note that execution is a discipline and needs to be practiced by company leaders at all levels. It’s not just a single component but it needs to be part of all strategies and goals. Without this, companies will fail to deliver.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s so important that a business leader knows how to execute well. You can be a leader full of ideas and aspirations but without the ability to execute well, these ideas will amount to nothing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bossidy identifies three key points to consider when thinking about execution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Execution is a discipline, it’s a critical component of the strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The business leader is responsible for encouraging and promoting execution.\nExecution needs to be at the core of an organization’s culture.\nDiscipline</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bossidy explains that you should think of execution as a process. Always be asking how and what, ask questions and remain accountable. Part of executing means that you need to be in a position to understand the business environment and the organization’s capabilities. You need to be able to make assumptions and forecasts. Execution requires the ability to link strategy + operations + people who are going to execute the strategy. If these links aren’t clear and synchronized then the execution won’t be streamlined or effective. Therefore, Bossidy explains that there are three processes that are critical to effective execution: the people process, the strategy process, and the operations process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"business-leaders\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#business-leaders\" aria-label=\"business leaders permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Business leaders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bossidy stresses the importance of having a great business leader who is totally committed to the company and has a clear understanding of the business and the current business environment. Without this commitment, a leader will not be in a position to execute strategies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bossidy explains that business leaders have three key roles when it comes to execution. They must select the people who will also be managing the strategy and execution. The leader is responsible for setting the strategic direction and ensuring that everyone involved understands the goals. They are also in charge of coordinating operations. Bossidy stressed the importance of having the leader do these jobs, they are not something that should be delegated to a lower colleague.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"culture\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#culture\" aria-label=\"culture permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Culture</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bossidy, like many other authors, stressed the importance of culture within a business. Bossidy explains that execution needs to be a core part of this culture, it needs to be the norm and something that all employees understand. A leader who executes is someone who is constantly analyzing the gap between the actual results and the desired results of any strategic plan. By learning from this gap they can take their knowledge onto the next project and make significant improvements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although Bossidy has pointed out that execution is the responsibility of senior leaders, it doesn’t mean that everyone in any organization should practice the skills. By learning the skills of execution at any level, you will be making strides in advancing your career and eventually reaching that senior leadership role.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s the combination of people as individuals and as a collective that aids execution. If you can get everyone moving in the same direction and at the same time then successful execution is much more likely. Bossidy explains that any leader that lacks the discipline of execution, isn’t really a leader at all. They must strive to be rigorous and consistent with their actions and encourage all team members to practice the discipline of execution.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-building-blocks-of-execution\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-building-blocks-of-execution\" aria-label=\"the building blocks of execution permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF EXECUTION</h2>\n<h3 id=\"building-block-one-seven-essential-behaviours-of-a-leader\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#building-block-one-seven-essential-behaviours-of-a-leader\" aria-label=\"building block one seven essential behaviours of a leader permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Building block one: seven essential behaviours of a leader</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The first essential behaviour a leader needs is to know the people and the business. It’s so important that a leader is in touch with who they work with and the current business climate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Realism is the second behaviour that a leader needs. Rather than avoiding the truth a great leader needs to embrace the truth. And if this means identifying and acknowledging weaknesses then be as real as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Leaders need to be setting goals and priorities. It’s a good idea to focus on a few key goals that the entire team can focus on. Don’t overcomplicate things with too many goals or priorities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being someone that always follows through is important for a leader, it means that people will believe what you say and take you seriously. Never be someone who has a lot to say but never puts anything into action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fifth behaviour a leader must have is the ability to reward people. In doing so you encourage your team to work hard and achieve results. Consider bonuses, pay rises or stocks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pass on knowledge, always expanding other people’s capabilities. Someone that you work with may be the leader one day so it’s important to share as much knowledge as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Leaders need to be strong characters who know themselves well. Accepting and acknowledging your own weaknesses and working to improve these is a great traits for a leader. It’s important that leaders are self-aware, have humility and are authentic.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"building-block-two-cultural-change\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#building-block-two-cultural-change\" aria-label=\"building block two cultural change permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Building block two: cultural change</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bossidy explains that companies often focus on changing their strategy and structures. But they fail to work on the people, beliefs, and behaviours of those that they work with. He emphasizes that cultural change is just as important (if not more) as strategy and structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bossidy identifies that companies that make an effort to change their culture often fail because they don’t find a direct link between culture and business outcomes. When the changes are so disconnected, they are not likely to succeed. A business needs to understand the deep connections between company culture and business outcomes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change people’s behaviour</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>By changing people’s behaviours, you are having a direct impact on the results they produce. So it’s important to ensure that the behavioural changes you encourage, promote a positive outcome. Bossidy explains that the first step is to clearly identify and communicate what results you are after. Then have a discussion about how those results are going to be reached. And finally, you reward people when their goals are reached. In the scenario where you and your team do not reach the end goal adequately, assess what happened and ask how can you learn for next time. It’s all about creating a culture of getting things done.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bossidy explains that behaviours are the outcome of beliefs being turned into action. The results are a direct result of the behaviours. When Bossidy talks about behaviour, he’s not referring to it on an individual level. He’s talking about collective behaviour from groups in corporate settings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"building-block-three-the-job-no-leader-should-delegate\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#building-block-three-the-job-no-leader-should-delegate\" aria-label=\"building block three the job no leader should delegate permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Building block three: The job no leader should delegate</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bossidy explains that there is one job that no leader should ever delegate, and that’s ensuring that the right people are in the right job. It’s absolutely critical that leaders fully understand the importance of having the right people in the right roles. After all, it’s the people that are responsible for generating the results and outcomes. These are the people that make decisions every day and take actions toward either success or failure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bossidy explains that consistently successful businesses always have a leader who is dedicated to selecting the perfect people for the perfect roles.

This plan needs to be clear and easily understood. Business leaders need to be able to understand what needs to be done in order to reach their goals. In order to establish an effective action plan, you first need to define and understand the critical issue. All good strategies have a critical issue that is the driving force behind it.

Bossidy identifies this as a critical step and encourages you to spend time debating the assumptions. Once you’ve come to a clear conclusion, you can then move on to set realistic goals. The next step in the process is the building of the operations plan. You begin by setting targets. Followed by developing action plans, and short-term and long-term objectives. Also, spend time developing contingency plans. Finally, everyone needs to agree on the plan and ensure that it’s clear and straightforward. Bossidy encourages everyone to have follow-up measures in place to ensure that everyone is staying on track and working on the right steps and the right time. Keep accountability going throughout the process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>”It breaks long-term output into short-term targets. Meeting those here-and-now targets forces decisions to be made and integrated across the organization, both initially and in response to changes in business conditions. It puts reality behind the numbers.”</p>\n<p>If it’s on your mind, your mind isn’t clear. Anything unfinished must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind.</p>\n<p>“The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small, manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.”—Mark Twain</p>\n<p>“There are only two problems in life:\n(1) you know what you want, and you don’t know how to get it; and/or\n(2) you don’t know what you want.”</p>\n<p>”Without execution, the breakthrough thinking breaks down, learning adds no value, people don’t meet their stretch goals, and the revolution stops dead in its tracks. What you get is a change for the worse, because failure drains the energy from your organisation. Repeated failure destroys it.”</p>\n<p>”Quarterly reviews help keep plans up to date and reinforce synchronization. They also give a leader a good idea about which people are on top of their businesses, which ones aren’t, and what the latter need to do.”</p>\n<p>”It’s the consistency of practice that develops expertise in appraising and choosing the right people. The people process begins with one-on-one assessments, but when developed and practiced as a total process, it becomes incredibly effective as an execution tool.”</p>\n<p>”Tactics are central to execution, but execution is not tactics. Execution is fundamental to strategy and has to shape it. No worthwhile strategy can be planned without taking into account the organisation’s ability to execute it.”</p>\n<p>”Leading for execution is not about micromanaging, or being “hands-on,” or disempowering people. Rather, it’s about active involvement—doing the things leaders should be doing in the first place.””To change a business’s culture, you need a set of processes— social operating mechanisms. These will change the beliefs and behaviour of people in ways that are directly linked to bottom-line results.”</p>\n<p>”You cannot have an execution culture without robust dialogue. One that brings reality to the surface through openness, candor, and informality. Robust dialogue makes an organization effective in gathering information, understanding the information, and reshaping it to produce decisions. It fosters creativity—most innovations and inventions are incubated through robust dialogue. Ultimately, it creates a more competitive advantage and shareholder value.”</p>\n<p>”When you interview, you have to create a full picture of the person in your mind based on things you can learn by probing them. Then you need to find out about their past and present accomplishments, how they think, and what drives their ambitions.”</p>\n<p>”To be effective, a strategy has to be constructed and owned by those who will execute it, namely the line people. Staff people can help by collecting data and using analytical tools, but the business leaders must be in charge of developing the substance of the strategic plan.”</p>\n<h1 id=\"reference\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reference\" aria-label=\"reference permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reference</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.grahammann.net/book-notes/getting-things-done-david-allen\">https://www.grahammann.net/book-notes/getting-things-done-david-allen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/remind-yourself-to-schedule-x\">https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/remind-yourself-to-schedule-x</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/getting-started-with-getting-things-done\">https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/getting-started-with-getting-things-done</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B00KWG9M2E\">https://www.amazon.ca/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B00KWG9M2E</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://altfeldinc.com/pdfs/execution.pdf\">https://altfeldinc.com/pdfs/execution.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/ChandraKopparapu/book-summary-of-execution-the-discipline-of-getting-things-done#:~:text=The%20book%20titled%20Execution%3A%20The,apart%20from%20those%20that%20fail\">https://www.slideshare.net/ChandraKopparapu/book-summary-of-execution-the-discipline-of-getting-things-done#:~:text=The%20book%20titled%20Execution%3A%20The,apart%20from%20those%20that%20fail</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wisewords.blog/book-summaries/execution-book-summary/\">https://wisewords.blog/book-summaries/execution-book-summary/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jfdperfsolutions.com/book-summary-execution-the-discipline-of-getting-things-done-by-bossidy-charan/\">https://www.jfdperfsolutions.com/book-summary-execution-the-discipline-of-getting-things-done-by-bossidy-charan/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youexec.com/book-summaries/execution-the-discipline-of-getting-things-done\">https://youexec.com/book-summaries/execution-the-discipline-of-getting-things-done</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/execution-the-discipline-of-getting-things-done-book-summary-7529cae05982\">https://medium.com/swlh/execution-the-discipline-of-getting-things-done-book-summary-7529cae05982</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://paulminors.com/blog/execution-book-summary-pdf/\">https://paulminors.com/blog/execution-book-summary-pdf/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"getting things done summary by David Allen","date":"June 14, 2022","description":"getting things done summary by David Allen"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/option-cashflow-strategies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"options cashflow strategies - wip"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/big-mistakes-summary/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Big Mistakes - The Best Investors and Their Worst Investments by Michael Batnick Summary"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ab60a573-9540-547e-b0e9-b73723973951","previousPostId":"b1f27211-c9fa-5a79-b7b5-3f81ada6ffdb","nextPostId":"2fe7c6a8-b07f-523a-a6f3-8d2128ccaf8e"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}

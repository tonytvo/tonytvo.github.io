People with the fixed mindset view failure as intolerable, and spend much of their time trying to prove to themselves and others how smart and/or talented they are. They do not believe in the power of effort.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>growth mindset</strong> is the belief that with hard work and experience, growth and development occur. This mindset creates a desire to learn. Those with the growth mindset see failure as an opportunity to learn, and they value risk-taking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>fixed mindsets prevent growth</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>People with a Fixed Mindset are often worried about what other people think. As they often judge others based on their aptitude for a task, they also assume others judge them all the time. Hence, people with a Fixed Mindset are obsessed with showing how talented and smart they are. In fact, Carol suggests that those with a Fixed Mindset revolve their whole personality around their talent. Subsequently, they need approval from others to protect their personalities and egos.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>growth mindsets encourage development</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The sky’s the limit for people like this, as they are always seeking to find new ways to learn. Importantly, individuals with Growth Mindsets are not fixated on being better than other people or receiving the best grades. These individuals obtain satisfaction from pushing themselves to the limit to help themselves grow. They will practice relentlessly and are aware that you have to work your hardest, and overcome some failures, to improve.</li>\n<li>People with a Growth Mindset enjoy being around people who are more skilled than them. They see spending time with more talented individuals as opportunities to learn new skills. Additionally, these people are always willing to discard a strategy if it is no longer working and replace it with a new approach.</li>\n<li>As well as improving themselves, individuals with a growth mindset encourage the surrounding people to continue learning and working on themselves. They understand that life is about working as a team. When others are happier or more successful, they are more likely to succeed themselves. As business owners, individuals with a Growth Mindset are respectful to their team members and grateful for their work. Additionally, they are open to others’ opinions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>fixed mindsets seek approval; growth mindsets seek development</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lou Gerstner took over IBM when it was similarly in a difficult spot. The environment was in a Fixed Mindset and wasting energy on internal disagreements. Each employee was merely doing what was best for themselves. Subsequently, the company was not meeting its customer needs. Gerstner changed this by breaking down the company’s hierarchy, emphasizing teamwork, and rewarding employees who supported their coworkers. Additionally, he put himself on the same level as his employees. This allowed him to engage with as many employees as possible. Gerstner was adopting a Growth Mindset, and this enabled shared development.</li>\n<li>Gerstner’s Growth Mindset enabled him to create a new work environment based on teamwork and development. The focus moved away from individuals’ success and towards shared development. He was able to bring about lasting success at IBM.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed Mindsets See Failures as Disasters; Growth Mindsets See Failures as Opportunities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact of Your Mindset</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Carol explains that individuals with a Fixed Mindset do not believe they can learn from their mistakes. Any failure is used as justification for their future being filled with failures. Additionally, any defeat cancels out all the individual’s previous successes. As this approach diminishes their self-confidence, Fixed Mindsets will often blame other people or circumstances for their failures. Alternatively, they will seek ways to cheat to get ahead. Instead of analyzing their weaknesses and improving based on their failures, they try to forget. These behaviors are underpinned by Fixed Mindsets believing that they are the finished product rather than a continual process.</li>\n<li>Carol provides basketball legend Michael Jordan as an example of an individual with a Growth Mindset. Although Jordan is arguably the greatest sportsman ever to live, he was imperfect. He missed some dunks, and he missed some game-winning shots. However, the critical matter is how Jordan responded to these misses. After making mistakes, he would practice the missed shot over and over again. Jordan’s ability to learn from his mistakes and practice these weaknesses brought him so much success. Jordan did not find fault in his teammates or his shoes for his own mistakes. Additionally, it is well-known that Jordan was a driving force behind his teammates’ improvements. Jordan wanted his teammates to be the best they could be. So, he always supported them in improving their game.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed Mindsets Avoid Difficulties; Growth Mindsets Relish Difficulties</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>While people with a Fixed Mindset get a thrill from easy things, people with a Growth Mindset get a thrill from what is complex. Fixed Mindsets struggle with difficult situations because they have to invest in making a positive outcome out of these situations. Effort is fundamental to success. However, people with a Fixed Mindset see situations where they have to spend more time and energy as a risk. The more time or energy they invest in a situation, the harder it becomes to blame external factors if they fail. The Fixed Mindsets avoid difficult situations as they do not want to question their talent or potentially make a fool of themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>THE GROWTH MINDSET BUILDS CHARACTER—A KEY COMPONENT TO SUCCESS.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Character comes from the growth mindset and the idea that when things go wrong, there are effective strategies that can be used to cope with or overcome them. Character gives a person the ability to keep going even when things get really difficult. It is the ability to stretch yourself beyond what you think is humanly possible, to maintain focus and positivity when things get unbearable, and to consistently work hard.</li>\n<li>Those with the fixed mindset focus on proving that they are better than everyone else, while those with the growth mindset strive only to be the best they can possibly be.  They figure out and take the steps necessary to succeed and to keep succeeding. Many great athletes shared that they have found more fulfillment in personal growth than in winning or achieving fame.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"childhood-role-models-define-our-mindset\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#childhood-role-models-define-our-mindset\" aria-label=\"childhood role models define our mindset permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Childhood role models define our mindset</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>impact of your parents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our mindsets start developing from birth. However, all babies are born with a Growth Mindset. Babies are curious about the world and want to learn and grow as much as possible each day. Therefore, it is the child’s environment growing up that determines whether the child maintains this Growth desire or eventually adopts a Fixed mindset. The most crucial agent in this shift is usually your parents. Parents have their mindset, and this will set an example for their children.</li>\n<li>Parents with a Growth Mindset will encourage their children to continue learning and questioning everything. Comparatively, parents with a Fixed Mindset will parent through judgment, punishment, and telling the children what is right and wrong. These parenting styles impact babies as young as 1. For example, babies with a Growth Mindset will help other babies when they are crying. In contrast, babies with a Fixed Mindset are annoyed when other babies are crying.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Impact of Your Teachers</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to parents, teachers are also fundamental role models in defining children’s mindsets. Some teachers adopt a Fixed Mindset by believing the ability of their students is unchangeable. In effect, they believe that some children are naturally intelligent, and others are destined to fail. However, there are many good teachers, also. These teachers will adopt a Growth Mindset by believing all their students are capable of learning anything. The teaching style of these teachers is more adaptable and places faith in the students. Generally, this teaching style helps all students perform better, even those who seemed doomed to fail.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"anyone-can-adopt-a-growth-mindset\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#anyone-can-adopt-a-growth-mindset\" aria-label=\"anyone can adopt a growth mindset permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Anyone can adopt a growth mindset</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>moving towards growth mindsets</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A journey towards a Growth Mindset also opens opportunities for developing concrete life plans. Developing a Growth Mindset will take time and the support of others around us. Therefore, we want supportive and honest people who are willing to talk to us about our mistakes and weaknesses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>breaking away from fixed mindsets</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breaking away from a Fixed Mindset can be particularly challenging. Fixed Mindsets are habits we have built over many years to protect us emotionally from our failures. Additionally, a lot of us will be reliant on our Fixed Mindset for our self-confidence. Suppose you are genuinely struggling to kick your Fixed Mindset. In that case, Carol suggests that adopting the Growth Perspective in certain situations is enough to have a positive impact. For example, you might accept you are terrible at sport. Despite this, you will apply a Growth Perspective to the most important things: Work, parenting, or studying. Additionally, you don’t only possess one mindset. Most people have elements of both that apply to different areas of their life. Therefore, your first task is to identify which areas you possess which mindset.</li>\n<li>Carol outlines that a Growth Mindset helps make the impossible possible. She encourages each of us to look at the most successful people globally and consider how they would respond to failure. Likely, you will find that they used failures along the way to reach their success.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Some Have Greater Opportunities, but We All Have a Chance</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It would be naive to say that effort is the only thing that’s important in succeeding. Effort is significant and is why those with a Growth Mindset increase their chances of success. Though, many other factors influence your chances of success. For example, Carol explains that resources and opportunities are useful for success. Those born into influential families with better access to education have a much higher chance of success. However, although your starting point matters, this does not mean you shouldn’t improve and create the best endpoint possible based on your opportunities</li>\n<li>Importantly, Carol concludes by stating that a Growth Mindset does not mean we should try to improve everything. Sometimes the wisest decision is to accept our imperfections, especially those that will cause little harm.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>applying the growth and fixed mindsets to business</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The most successful business managers are not natural talents who ooze ego. Instead, they are the individual who is continuously looking to learn. They are also willing to ask questions and are not afraid to fail in front of their employees. They keep faith in their team to improve when they have made a mistake, rather than deeming them failures.</li>\n<li>In contrast, Fixed Mindset bosses are dangerous. They often seek to be controlling and abusive to showcase their superiority. These behaviors push their fellow employees to adopt Fixed Mindsets, as well. Hence, instead of moving forward through learning, the company will be fixated on individual goals. Additionally, they will aim to obtain short-term goals by covering up mistakes and screwing other people over.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Applying the Growth and Fixed Mindsets to Love</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relationships can often be complicated, and most of us will have multiple failed romantic relationships throughout our life. Individuals with a Fixed Mindset see these failed relationships as a defining feature of themselves. They label themselves as unlovable and want revenge for the rejection they have experienced. People with a Growth Mindset will also find rejection difficult. However, they will also see it as an opportunity to reflect on where things went wrong in the relationship</li>\n<li>Additionally, the two mindsets have different levels of success in relationships. Relationships based on Fixed Mindsets are destined to fail, as both parties will be expecting everything to be perfect with no effort. Additionally, both parties believe that love can solve everything</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>3 actions for you</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Think about how you can put yourself into a growth mindset more often. What triggers your fixed mindset and how you can deal with it?</li>\n<li>When praising your children, praise effort and progress</li>\n<li>Think about how you can demonstrate growth mindset to your children</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"little-big-things\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#little-big-things\" aria-label=\"little big things permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Little Big Things</h1>\n<h2 id=\"little\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#little\" aria-label=\"little permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“LITTLE”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It’s All About the Restrooms!</strong> A sparkling restroom with family photos in a small</li>\n</ul>\n<p>restaurant in Gill MA shouts “We care.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“Small Stuff” Matters.

Heller responds, ‘Yes, but I have something he will never have … enough.‘” Enough said.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Good Things (Especially in Bad Times?)

I am anti-authoritarian to the core, but there are rare exceptions to that rule.</li>\n<li>(2) “Over”-communicate. (!!!)</li>\n<li>(3) “Over”-communicate.

First, that creates the perception that “they aren’t dilly-dallyin’“—motion matters. Second, the cure is anything but sure—so one must get moving if for no other reason than to see what happens when the system is perturbed. Third, there must be a willingness to admit error and stop a failed experiment ASAP—rather than holding on as a way of not admitting the experiment was a bust.</li>\n<li>(10) Also “over”-communicate beyond the group.</li>\n<li><strong>Get China on Your Mind!

Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s The Black</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swan was an extraordinarily well-timed book. The black swan is an unpredictable event. If it’s unpredictable, what, then, if anything, can we do about it? One answer is create “resilient enterprises” staffed with people in all positions who have exhibited a disposition for resilience. While we can hardly afford “redundant everything,” policies and processes and projects and training aimed at increased resilience are very much possible—e.g., Microsoft helped employees equip their home offices when it appeared the swine flu might restrict the # of folks working in standard offices for a lengthy period.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lifetime Employment Is Dead.

(All you need to know in</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>life.) Hence, it is axiomatic that whoever fails the most wins—truly.

The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind.”—Henry James</li>\n<li>“There is a misconception that supportive interactions require more staff or more time and are therefore more costly. Although labor costs are a substantial part of any hospital budget, the interactions themselves add nothing to the budget.</li>\n<li>“Kindness is free.”</li>\n<li>“Listening to patients or answering their questions costs nothing. It could be argued that negative interactions—alienating patients, being unresponsive to their needs, or limiting their sense of control—can be very costly. Angry, frustrated, or frightened patients may be combative, withdrawn, and less cooperative—requiring far more time than it would have taken to interact with them initially in a positive way.”</li>\n<li>This has become a centerpiece of my work. In the commercial sphere I encompass it with an equation:\n<ul>\n<li>K = R = P. : Kindness = Repeat business = Profit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>That is, among other things, kindness is the ultimate “hard” variable affecting the bottom line.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Listen to Ann—and “Act Accordingly.”</strong> The late Texas governor Ann Richards tells us</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>that despite ire, or even fury, at a service mixup, you must remember that the frontline person you are dealing with is the … only person on earth … who can help you. Act accordingly—i.e. with reverence! It’s great advice! It works!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>“Being There” (Or: How I Learned First Principles from My Grandfather’s Last Rites.)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.”—Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People</li>\n<li>My grandfather ran a little country store in a little town in Virginia. Thousands—literally—attended his funeral. He had been helpmate to virtually everyone in the community over the years. That turnout sent an unforgettable message to me.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Appreciating the Great Battle: A Case for Consideration</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.”—Plato</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have to understand that not only your business situation changes, but the people you’re working with aren’t the same day to day. Someone is sick. Someone is having a wedding.

(It’s a Start)</strong> Woody Allen famously said that “Eighty percent of success is showing up.” It’s a good laugh line—and unchallengeable. It’s true for me and you—and true in circumstances of the greatest import. In 1787 in the U.S., delegates came to Philadelphia to draft our enduring, as it turned out, Constitution. The smallest of all the states, Delaware, may have greater influence than any other state. They took the effort seriously (some, such as New York, didn’t). Delaware sent a big delegation, they showed up every day (most others didn’t) and members volunteered to do every damn thing imaginable—and in the end it paid off, big time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hence I conclude that “Woody’s strategy” works in an office of five people—and when the fate of a nation is at stake. As I said … Big Time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Get Up Earlier Than the Next (in This Case) Gal</strong>. I was flying to Boston from London</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>on a Saturday morning. It was a seven-hour flight. A professional woman was sitting in front of me. I duly swear, she did not look up once during the entire flight. She produced more on her laptop in those seven hours than I do in a week. Or a month.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There’s something to say for out-working “the other guy”—or woman. In short, I would give both my right and left arms to have the woman described above on my side—and, God help me, not on the other side!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make an Insane Public Effort. The late sports super-agent Mark McCormack (once voted</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>the most powerful man in sports) once condoned and even certified one of my own crazy habits. He said there are times, not necessarily infrequent, when it is wise-imperative to travel 5,000 miles for a 5-minute meeting. It was a tactic I started using in 1974, when I was a junior White House staffer working on drug abuse issues. And the power and effectiveness thereof are literally beyond measure. You can get a lot done in a short meeting when it’s clear that you’ve killed yourself to be there; but it’s overwhelmingly psychological. The power of making an “insane effort” almost always breaks a logjam—and not infrequently leads to a solution on the spot. The key word here is … “insane.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"leadership\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#leadership\" aria-label=\"leadership permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>LEADERSHIP</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>To Lead Is to Help Others Succeed.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“The role of the director is to create a space where the actors and actresses can become more than they’ve ever been before, more than they’ve dreamed of being.”—Robert Altman, Oscar acceptance speech</li>\n<li>“No matter what the situation, the great manager’s first response is always to think about the individual concerned and how things can be arranged to help that individual experience success.”—Marcus Buckingham, The One Thing You Need to Know The “business” of leaders at all levels is to help those in their charge develop beyond their dreams—which in turn almost automatically leads to “all that other stuff,” such as happy customers, happy stockholders, happy communities.</li>\n<li>To start the ball rolling, change every performance review into a two-part process, the first in which there is a rigorous evaluation of the employee—and the second of which is a rigorous review of your own efforts to help that employee forward.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>At Their Service</strong>. Leadership is a “service business.” Robert Greenleaf gave us the concept of “servant leadership”—it’s one of those “pretty much all you need to know” ideas. My take:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) Organizations exist to serve. Period.</li>\n<li>(2) Leaders exist to serve their people. Period.</li>\n<li>(3) A team well-served by its leader will be inclined to pursue Excellence.</li>\n<li>Use the word “Serve.” (That’s what you do.)</li>\n<li>Use the word “Service.” (That’s what you provide.)</li>\n<li>Use the word “Servant.” (That’s what you are.)</li>\n<li>The unadorned word “service” is beauty encapsulated.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Have You “Hosted” Any Good Employees Lately?</strong> Consider the leader’s primary job to</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>be a host to her or his employees. That’s the way Jan Gunnarsson and Olle Blohm put it in\nHostmanship: The Art of Making People Feel Welcome. Gunnarsson and Blohm based this universal (as they—and I—see it) idea on their experience owning/running a hotel. Here’s the core idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“We went through the hotel and made a … ‘consideration renovation.’ Instead of redoing bathrooms, dining rooms, and guest rooms, we gave employees new uniforms, bought flowers and fruit, and changed colors. Our focus was totally on the staff. They were the ones we wanted to make happy. We wanted them to wake up every morning excited about a new day at work.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“The path to a hostmanship culture paradoxically does not go through the guest. In fact it wouldn’t be totally wrong to say that the guest has nothing to do with it. True hostmanship leaders focus on their employees. What drives exceptionalism is finding the right people and getting them to love their work and see it as a passion. … The guest comes into the picture only when you are ready to ask, ‘Would you prefer to stay at a hotel where the staff love their work or where management has made customers its highest priority?‘”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your call, but I’d call it “putting first things first”—and it applies as much in the 7-person purchasing department as in the retail establishment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A Sacred Trust</strong>. As I see it, anyone who takes on any leadership job, minor or major, assumes no less than a … Sacred Trust. I know that’s extreme language. But I stand by it. This sacred trust is all about what organizations are all about: the professional (and, to some extent, personal) development of people. Sure, the boss’s job is to “get the job done,” and done effectively. But “boss-hood” primarily entails an abiding responsibility for the people under your charge. (It’s circular, of course: Turned-on people do turned-on work. Q.E.D.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider this as the translation of “sacred trust” into a plank in your core-values statement: “We are committed to the measurable growth of each and every member of our staff. We aspire to have every staff member say, of their stay here, ‘That was a remarkable period of my development.‘”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rat Psych Rules! Or: Deploying Positive Reinforcement’s Incredible Potency.</strong> You can</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>overdo anything—including positive reinforcement. It’s just that in 9 out of 10 cases (more like 99 in 100) we “underdo” positive reinforcement—and usually overdo negative reinforcement. I, like Mark Twain, “can live for months on a compliment” or a small act of encouragement. This is one powerful tool!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider the following, drawn from the recent book Barack, Inc.: Winning Business Lessons from the Obama Campaign, by Rick Faulk and Barry Libert:</li>\n<li>“[Retired United States Navy] Captain Mike Abrashoff knows the importance of saying ‘thank you.’ In his first book, It’s Your Ship, he relates how he sent letters to the parents of his crew members on the guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold … Putting himself in those parents’ shoes, he imagined how happy they would be to hear from the Commanding Officer that their sons and daughters were doing well. And he figured that those parents would, in turn, call their children to tell them how proud they were of them.</li>\n<li>“Abrashoff debated whether to send a letter to the parents of one young man who wasn’t really star material. Weighing the sailor’s progress, he decided to go ahead. A couple of weeks later, the sailor appeared at his door, tears streaming down his face. It seems the kid’s father had always considered him a failure and told him so. After reading the captain’s letter, he called to congratulate his son and tell him how proud he was of him. ‘Captain, I can’t thank you enough,’ said the young man. For the first time in his life, he felt loved and encouraged by his father.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"words\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#words\" aria-label=\"words permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>WORDS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“What Do You Think?”</strong> Our colleague Dave Wheeler said, in a Comment at</li>\n</ul>\n<p>tompeters.com: “The four most important words in management are … ‘What do you think?‘” I agree! And the old engineer in me screams: Quantify! So: How many times today did you “use the four words”? I.e., exactly how many times did you utter: “What do you think?”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Maybe go so far as to put this idea in the formal “values statement”:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“We obsessively ask ‘What do you think?’—We understand that we rise or fall on the engagement and intelligence and constant contributions of 100% of us.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>“Thank You”</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“The deepest human need is the need to be appreciated.”—William James, premier American psychologist</li>\n<li>“You shouldn’t be looking for people slipping up, you should be looking for all the good things people do and praising those.”—Richard Branson</li>\n<li>There’s no overestimating the power of appreciation—and yet its application is usually stingy at best. Hence, as in so many of these “discussions of the obvious,” this is a genuine skill to be practiced, mastered and applied. And, again, please think about it, perhaps “Thank you” ought to gain a place of honor in the values statement: “We habitually express appreciation for one another’s efforts—because we do in fact consciously appreciate everyone’s ‘ordinary’ ‘daily’ contributions, let alone the extraordinary ones.” Or words to that effect …</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>“I’m Sorry.”</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Message: THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

I believe we are talking about, in practical business terms, a … “matchless strategic lever.” In the arsenal of what really matters when it comes to getting things done/execution/ implementation, there are few—if any—“power tools” that have the heft of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I apologize.”</li>\n<li>“I’m sorry.”</li>\n<li>“I’m to blame.”</li>\n<li>“Simply put, I screwed up.”</li>\n<li>“I bear full responsibility for this f***-up.”</li>\n<li>“I blew it.

If you are willing to invest the time, and it takes time, “sucking down” is a high-odds affair—to paraphrase the immortal robber Willy Sutton on why he chose to knock off banks, “It’s where the money is.” (Oh is it ever!) In addition to the plain fact that “down there” is where the real work is done, indirectly, where the deal is effectively done, the folks a couple of levels “down” [“down” always in quotes—“‘down’ is the real ‘up’” is the anthem here] are typically bowled over by your time and attention—we all crave being taken seriously. Hence, the next thing you know (after a lot of work) you’ve got a network to die for in the bowels of the customer organization working for you—and it’s a network, typically, with staying power; there’s not so much volatility “down there.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As always, the point is not “catch as catch can” or “a good idea.” It’s about a well thought-out scheme, in fact, no less than a “way of life”—a measured, systematic effort to penetrate the ranks of a client organization and develop a set of relationships with the real deal makers! (Hint: As in so many implementation issues, women are instinctively better at this than men.)</li>\n<li>(NB: Alternate formulation to “Suck down for success”: “Success does not depend on ‘the people you know in high places’—it depends on ‘the people you know in low places.’“)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Formula for Success: C(I) > C(E).</strong> I’ve long argued that the set of relationships inside your own company is almost as important as the relationships with external bill-paying</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>customers. While it may not be a universal truth, it struck me as I talked to a GE group that sold big international projects that in many cases our Internal Customers/“C(I)” are in more important\nthan our External Customers/“C(E).” That is: C(I) > C(E)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the GE case, to win with External Customers the systems salespeople typically want an “unfair share” (the words of one GE informant) of a host of insiders’ time—engineers, the logistics team,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>lawyers and the all-important (“yes” or “no”) risk-assessment staff.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bottom line: What … PRECISELY (measure it!!) … have you done lately (LAST 36 HOURS!) for your all-important “portfolio” of … INTERNAL CUSTOMERS?

In my experience, it is the rare staff department that measures (internal) customer satisfaction religiously—and the ever more rare internal unit that ties substantial rewards and penalties to such measurements. That must change!</li>\n<li>Case: I met the boss of Staff Services at a large Italian bank. He was fanatic about “customer” satisfaction for his departments’ internal customers. In his scheme, each staff department’s internal “customers” themselves devised the measures; and the primary dollars and cents (Euro) incentives for staff departments were based primarily on quantitative measures of their internal customers’ satisfaction—the staff department exec called this Internal Customer Satisfaction System “my principal strategic initiative.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"lunch\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#lunch\" aria-label=\"lunch permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>LUNCH</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Across the Board: Cross-Functional Collaboration Is Issue #1</strong>—in a 6-person logistics sub-department, a 12-table restaurant, an auto dealership.

I.e., “No” = No.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When we arrived in town from Vermont, we were therefore nonplussed to find a message from Joan, saying, “I’ll be arriving at 7.” We obviously asked her why she’d changed her mind.</li>\n<li>“I decided to say ‘Yes.‘” She recalled a friend who’d had a vigorous life into her 90s. “She said she had three ‘secrets’: First, surround yourself with good books on any and every topic. Second,  spend time with people of all ages. And third, say ‘Yes.‘” She added that indeed she had not intended to drive down from Connecticut.

As Michael Specter wrote in his wonderful New Yorker profile (“Branson’s Luck”), “Branson likes to enter a market controlled by a giant … British Airways, say, or Coke or Murdoch.

A few years ago he received a huge $$$ grant—and he was given the opportunity to roll out his program across the country. Suddenly, he was required to turn his innovative ideas into a system that could be replicated by “ordinary people.” Dennis is “one of those people” who has 10 ideas a minute—moreover, all 10 are usually good ideas. And so his talented staff ran around madly working on exciting this or exciting that. But now he had that “low variation” system to run—and things promised to be different. I attended a meeting of his advisory Committee at a critical moment. The Chairman had been CEO of an enormous firm. I will always remember a single line that emerged from the fellow’s mouth:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>“Dennis, you need a ‘to-don’t’ list.”</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In simple language: What you decide not to do is probably more important that what you decide to do. (A lot of smart-wise people agree on this, super-coach Marshall Goldsmith, the gold standard, among them.) But you probably can’t work on “to-don’t” alone—you need a sounding board/mentor/advisor/nag you trust to act as a Drill Sergeant who will frog-march you to the woodshed when you stray and start doing those time-draining “to don’ts.” (Said advisor could be spouse, professional coach, other, need not be expert in your world, and must be totally trusted.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Some Things Worth Doing Are Worth Doing Not Particularly Well.</strong> The reminder</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>came one night as I was doing dishes. I was dealing with a particularly resistant old baking pan. I cleaned up the food residue—it was fully sanitary. But there was some crusty crap left, which I went after with a vengeance—but somewhat unsuccessfully. At one point I started laughing at myself. The pan was sanitary and “clean enough,” plus I really didn’t need to treat the effort like a speech to Fortune 50 CEOs.\nThe micro-event (I did stop) reminded me of the Greater Truth. In a world (personal,\nprofessional) of limited resources (time, in this instance, time in most instances) and priorities of the utmost importance (to you and me at any rate), there’s a lot of “stuff” that must be done—but for which “good enough” is in fact good enough. For some of us making the distinction is easier said than done—and the cost for not figuring out the difference is high.</p>\n<h2 id=\"customers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#customers\" aria-label=\"customers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>CUSTOMERS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It’s 11 A.M.—Have You Called a Customer Today?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call a Customer.</li>\n<li>Out of the Blue.</li>\n<li>“How can I help?”</li>\n<li>“Have we delivered on every promise, implicit as well as explicit?”</li>\n<li>Listen and take copious notes.</li>\n<li>Follow-up instantly on at least one “little” thing.</li>\n<li>Repeat. 48-hours hence.</li>\n<li>Hint: This applies to 100% of us.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>There’s Nothing But Nothing Cooler Than an Angry Customer!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“The problem is almost never the problem.

It is not enough, he said with an icy stare, to do one’s best [in taking care of my sailors], I must do it, period. [A parallel Churchill quote goes like this: “It is not enough to do your best—you must succeed in doing what is necessary.“] All I can say, 43 years later, is that the lesson took.\n<ul>\n<li>Consider: “A man approached J.P. Morgan, held up an envelope, and said, ‘Sir, in my hand I hold a guaranteed formula for success, which I will gladly sell you for $25,000.’</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>‘Sir,’ J.P. Morgan replied, ‘I do not know what is in the envelope; however, if you show it to me, and I like it, I give you my word a as gentleman that I will pay you what you ask.’ The man agreed to the terms, and handed over the envelope. J.P. Morgan opened it, and extracted a single sheet of paper. He gave it one look, a mere glance, then handed the piece of paper back to the gent. And paid him the agreed-upon $25,000. The contents of the note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>“1. Every morning, write a list of the things that need to be done that day.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>“2. Do them.”</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>**Captain “Day” and Captain “Night”: A Tale of Two Deployments and Two</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Suggestions.** As a combat engineer (Seabee) in Vietnam, I made two deployments and had two commanding officers, or COs. To this day, I call them “day” and “night.” My first CO, Dick Anderson (CAPTAIN Anderson!), was “day.” Our job was to build stuff—roads, bridges, camps,\ngun emplacements, etc.—mostly for the U.S. Marine Corps. Captain Andy’s approach could be summarized in three words, subsequently made immortal by Nike; namely, “Just do it.” Above all, Captain Andy wanted no damned excuses. The upshot was that we got a lot of work done, and\ndone well, in short order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Deployment #2 brought Captain “Night,” whose name shall not be mentioned. He had a different style of “leadership” entirely. It’s often called “by the book.” He was a stickler for the formalities. I sometimes thought and think that he was more interested in typo-free reports of jobs not yet done than hell-and-high-water-completed construction. I had a crappy time, as did pretty much the whole set of junior officers; and our track record in getting things done for our customers was less than sterling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Between the two, I had pretty much all I needed for a successful management career. When faced with a thorny issue, I try to follow Captain Andy’s rules—and avoid the approach of Capt. Night at all costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If You Want To Find Oil, You Must Drill Wells.</strong> Right after publishing In <em>Search of Excellence</em>, I received a nice note in the mail accompanied by an inscribed book: The Hunters by John Masters, a successful Canadian Oil &#x26; Gas wildcatter.

But he also knew there were astonishingly effective, renegade Civil Servants at work in the underbelly of the system—plying their effective-but-scorned trade as far from the light as possible.

(This happens also to be true with individual change.) You’ve got a great new software solution to a purchasing conundrum. You need a test bed. At a meeting, you get into a private discussion with the on-the-make General Manager of a small division of BigCo in Ireland; she thinks your new software is off-the-charts good, and is keen to get a jump on others by becoming an early adopter.

That is, get going ASAP—and quickly experiment your way toward/to success. But when my wife and I had a Grand Idea in 2008 for a landscaping project that would change the look and feel of our Farm in Tinmouth VT, we decided, more or less, to … do it all at once. There has been pain from biting off more than we could readily chew, but the story to this point has the mark of a real success far beyond our initial imaginings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The power of “getting going on everything at once” with but a sliver of a master plan (a couple of “napkin” sketches) was that we could envision from the outset the vague outline of what was going to (more or less) end up happening—thence we could adjust like crazy, improvise</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>constantly, destroy and create using the entire palette, and dramatically reshape the overall work, and even the overall concept, as we went along. Which, of course, means we didn’t really reject my beloved Rapid Experimentation Method—we just did it on and amidst a Grand Platform\ncalled “everything is in motion and up for grabs.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I’m not sure I’d do things, big things, this way in every instance, but I do think there are times when such an “all at once” approach is merited—when you have a Big Idea but need to be living “in the middle of it,” with all ends loose ends, to figure out what it means.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Big Change—in a Short Time.</strong> The story goes that General George Patton turned around a bedraggled U.S. Army in North Africa in a matter of a few weeks upon taking charge in 1943. (Some say a few days.) Upon taking over a new command, Admiral Lord Nelson would change</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>the attitude of an entire fleet in … less than a week. The CEO of a giant transportation company completely upended line officers’ responsibility and authority and accountability (increased by an order of magnitude) almost “overnight”—literally everyone, including a couple of “hopeless bureaucrats,” bitched and moaned and rose to the occasion—performance spurted more or less\ninstantly, and then kept going.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Several expert analysts argue from extensive anecdotal evidence that “big change” is actually “easier” than small change. Mostly because it’s far easier to get people excited about a Big Hairy Audacious Goal (Jim Collins’s felicitous term) than “incremental improvement:” also big, quick change cuts off escape routes. My “bottom line” after lots of thought and observation: Change will take precisely as long as you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>think it will. The “arrogance of absurdly high expectations” can pay off in very short order if you’ve got the nerve to go for it and the deep-rooted (messianic) belief that … “There’s utterly no reason why we can’t do this in a month!”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clever? Never!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>“The art of war does not require complicated maneuvers; the simplest are the best, and common sense is fundamental. From which one might wonder how it is generals make blunders; it is because they try to be clever.”—Napoleon</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I make every effort to read new business strategy books and articles. In 90 percent of cases, I can dismiss neither the author’s thought process nor his or her evidence—but I am always taken aback by the abundance of “clever” and the absence of any discussion or consideration of the ability to implement the suggestions made or implied. There is total silence around the subject. For example, I did a quick analysis of the Index of one “famous” strategy tome circa 2007—words like “people” and “customer” and “leadership” and “implementation” and “execution” were literally missing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(NB: I gave some thought to not including any commentary in #83, just letting Napoleon’s quote stand alone on the page. I dearly do not want to dilute in any way the power and clarity and simplicity of his words.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SPECIAL SECTION: You, Me, and Charlie Wilson’s War</p>\n<ul>\n<li>George Crile’s Charlie Wilson’s War, the tale of the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan (which led directly to its subsequent unraveling), is quite simply the most extraordinary nonfiction potboiler I have ever read. And, perhaps surprisingly, it has lessons for you and me from Congressman Wilson and his CIA cohort, Gust Avrakotos:</li>\n<li>(1) Make friends with the … “Invisible 95%.” Gust Avrakotos apparently knew every “top floor”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CIA executive secretary by name—and had helped many of them sort out personal or professional problems. The folks in the mailroom and in the bowels of the computer operations affairs were also the subject of Gust’s intense and affectionate attentions. In effect, you could say that Gust was Commander-in-Chief of the “Invisible 95%” of the Agency—which allowed him to make extraordinary things happen despite furious resistance from his bosses and bosses’ bosses sitting atop a very rigid organization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(2) Create a Networker-Doer Partnership. Congressman Wilson had the networking part down, but he needed help with the doing. Conversely, if you are the doer, then you must find the politician-networker.</li>\n<li>(3) Carefully manage the BOF/Balance Of Favors. Practice potlatch—giving so much help to so many people on so many occasions (purposeful overkill!) that there is little issue about their supporting you when the (rare!) time comes to call in the chits.</li>\n<li>(4) Follow the money! “Anybody with a brain can figure out that if they can get on the Defense subcommittee, that’s where they ought to be—because that’s where the money is.”—Charlie Wilson</li>\n<li>(5) Found material. (And found people.) Don’t reinvent the wheel. It costs too much, takes too much time, requires too much bureaucratic hassle, and is too hard to implement—you’ve got enough problems already.</li>\n<li>(6) The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Hold your nose—and get the job done with some thorns in your side at your side.</li>\n<li>(7) Real, Visible Passion! Create graphic evidence of the source of your passion. Wilson’s passion about his beliefs were visibly magnified by tactics he shamelessly employed to make it personal—and to make sure that others knew it was personal. For example, on every visit to the refugee camps, Wilson donated blood on the spot.</li>\n<li>(8) Passion as Deterrence. Passion suggests exhausting “staying power”—“I might as well not waste energy or chits blocking him, he’s not going away and he’ll hound me and absorb my time till hell freezes over.”</li>\n<li>(9) Cut red tape. “What we did in one month with Charlie would have taken us nine years to accomplish.”—Gust Avrakotos</li>\n<li>(10) Create a small, insanely committed “band of brothers-sisters” to act as mostly invisible orchestrators.</li>\n<li>(11) Keep the Long Haul in Mind, Too. Passion for today’s action is paramount—but always, always, always think consciously about … Network Investment for the future.</li>\n<li>(12) The Game Ain’t Over Until the Fat Lady Sings. “They” (lots of “theys”) call it the Law of Unintended Consequences. In this instance, after the Russians had withdrawn from Afghanistan, the U.S. once again returned to benign neglect of the region—the result was, indirectly, 9/11, orchestrated from Afghanistan by some of the people we had supported a decade earlier.</li>\n<li>In Honor of Charlie and Gust and Their Ilk:\n<ul>\n<li>“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.

The prominent instructor asked the group, “Who is your #1 enemy?” Answers, no surprise, included “competitors,” “execs who play politics,” “clunky systems,” “thoughtless regulations.” “No,” the instructor snapped, “it’s your desk—getting stuck behind your desk and slowly, or not-so-slowly, losing touch.” Amen!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>l- <strong>Big Plan? No, Small Steps (Steps on the Ground)</strong> In The White Man’s Burden: Why the\nWest’s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good, nation-building expert William Easterly laments, “The West spent $2.3 trillion on foreign aid over the last five decades and still has not managed to get 12-cent medicines to children to prevent half of all malaria deaths. The West spent $2.3 trillion and still has not managed to get three dollars to each new mother to prevent five million child deaths.”\nEasterly is the arch enemy of the Big Plan (his capital letters, not mine—for once) and the fan of practical activities of “Searchers” (his cap “S”) who learn the ins and outs of the culture, politics, and local conditions “on the ground” in order to use local levers, and get those 12-cent medicines to community members. He writes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“In foreign aid, Planners announce good intentions but don’t motivate anyone to carry them out; Searchers find things that work and get some reward. Planners raise expectations but take no responsibility for meeting them; Searchers accept responsibility for their actions; Planners determine what to supply; Searchers find out what is in demand. Planners apply global blueprints; Searchers adapt to local conditions. Planners at the top lack knowledge of the bottom; Searchers find out what the reality is at the bottom. Planners never hear whether the planned recipients got what they needed; Searchers find out if the customer is satisfied. … A Planner thinks he already knows the answers; he thinks of poverty as a technical engineering problem that his answers will solve. A Searcher admits he doesn’t know the answers in advance; he believes that poverty is a complicated tangle of political, social, historical, institutional, and technological factors; he hopes to find answers to individual problems only by trial and error and experimentation. A Planner believes outsiders know enough to impose solutions; a Searcher believes only insiders have enough knowledge to find solutions, and that most solutions must be homegrown.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Herewith, a sampling of the “lessons” I’ve extracted from William Easterly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lesson: Show up!

The formulation that follows came from a speech I gave in Shanghai in the spring of 2009. I was part of a program that included renowned consultants, economists, etc. I began by saying, “In the next several hours you will hear many prescriptions for dealing with today’s shaky times—and preparing for China’s future. Many of those prescriptions will involve the role of the government in manipulating economic levers, the sorts of help that big firms and SMEs will need, etc. I will doubtless find myself in agreement with many, probably most, of the suggestions made.” But then I added that my role was to simplify, to boldly and perhaps foolhardily assert that, regardless of economic levers pulled, there was in fact only … One Thing that Really Mattered in the long run to the health of the enterprise—and, indeed, the economy as a whole: the quality and character of the work force. (And, concomitantly, the unstinting “24/7” devotion of enterprise leaders to developing each and every member of that work force.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This applies to 100% of people in the workforce. As in a football team or symphony orchestra, there are no “bit players.” This applies in every industry and for every price-point strategy therein. In Brazil, Magazine Luiza, the country’s Wal*Mart, is invariably near the top of the “Best Companies to Work For” list, just as Wegmans, the regional grocer, and the Container Store are at the head of the pack, peers of Google and Amgen, on the American “Best” list. This applies to companies of all sizes—from microscopic to humongous. This applies in good times—and especially in bad times. Engaged workers and an unwavering commitment to Excellence from those workers are not the whole story—but they are the bedrock upon which all else is built.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Up with People! As in: Increase Your People Budget</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>So here’s my dogmatic suggestion: When you’ve absolutely, positively, unequivocally locked down your budget for the next year, I beg you to pick the lock.

Women are no longer content to provide efficient labor or to be consumers. … With rising budgets and more autonomy to spend, this is just the beginning.

But … language matters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Women Lead! (Can Men Learn to Be Good Sports About It?)</strong> A main message of The Little BIG Things deals with the-”soft”-stuff-that-is-really-the-”hard”-stuff that underpins organization and individual effectiveness. Fact is, a lot of “this stuff” (e.g., primacy of relationship development) comes pretty naturally to most women—and is Big News and a struggle to most males. Hence, I wonder sometimes, mostly as I toss and turn in bed, if this book, and its ilk, have much or any relevance to women. Or do some-many-most-damn near all women readers laugh themselves silly as, one more time, I treat the obvious as the un-obvious? (E.g., “Listening is a … Very Good Thing.“) Consider just one compelling example, from “Gender Experiments Surprise Even the Experts,” a chapter sub-title in Leadership and the Sexes: Using</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gender Science to Create Success in Business, by Michael Gurian and Barbara Annis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“In the 1990s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/CBC created a short film that recorded an experiment in leadership styles between women and men. CBC didn’t tell the participants the objective of the work they would do that day; the director simply divided the male and female</li>\n</ul>\n<p>leaders into two teams, and gave those team leaders the same directions: build an adventure camp. The teams were set up in a somewhat militaristic style at first, including team members wearing uniforms, but also with the caveat in place that the teams could alter their style and method as they wished as long as they met the outcome in time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“Leader one immediately created a rank-and-file hierarchy and gave orders, even going so far as to assert authority by challenging members on whether they had polished their shoes. Leader two did not have the ‘troops’ line up and be inspected, but instead met with the other team members in a circle, asking ‘How are we doing? Are we ready?’ ‘Anything else we should do?’ ‘Do you think they’ll test us on whether we’ve polished our shoes?’ Instead of giving orders, leader two was touching team members on the arm to reassure them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“As part of the program, CBC arranged for corporate commentators to watch the teams prepare. Initially the commentators (mostly men) were not impressed by the leadership style of leader two; the second team wasn’t ‘under control,’ members weren’t lined up, and they ‘lacked order’ (or so it seemed). The commentators predicted that team two would not successfully complete the task. Yet, when the project was completed, team two had built an impressive adventure camp as good as team one’s, with some aspects that were judged as better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“When de-briefing their observations, the commentators noticed that when team one was building the structures for the camp, there had been discord regarding who was in charge and who had completed which job and who hadn’t. Team one exhibited a lack of communication during the process of completion that created problems (for example, ‘Wasn’t someone else supposed to do this?‘) Team two, on the other hand, took longer to do certain things, but because of its emphasis on communication and collaboration during the enactment of the task (such as ‘Let’s try this’ and ‘What do you think about that?’), the team met the goal of building the adventure camp in its own positive way, and on time.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Men, “Get the Facts”: Women Are Different</strong>. I love the writer Anita Shreve. I recently read her superb The Weight of Water. Few writers—and virtually no male writers, as I see it— deal so lucidly or movingly or in such depth, with life’s painful tangles of relationships. Simple fact: Women by and large instinctively appreciate complex, inchoate sets of human relationships. Men are more or less clueless. (Research, including recent neurobiological research, increasingly supports this dichotomy.) Translating this into the emotion-driven, all-important-these-days</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>world of design, I have by and large concluded, after 1.5 decades of study and writing and contemplation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>MEN CANNOT EFFECTIVELY DESIGN PRODUCTS-SERVICES-EXPERIENCES FOR WOMEN.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MEN CANNOT EFFECTIVELY SELL OR MARKET TO WOMEN.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MEN WHO DISAGREE WITH THIS ARE DELUSIONAL.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I can’t change that, hard as I may try. But I can do … something (and so can you):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I PLEDGE … THAT I WILL NEVER ENGAGE IN ANY SORT OF DISCUSSION OF PRODUCTS-SERVICES-EXPERIENCES THAT INCLUDE WOMEN AS CUSTOMERS CLIENTS, UNLESS ONE THIRD OR MORE OF THOSE PRESENT AND IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY ARE WOMEN.</li>\n<li>I PLEDGE … THAT I WILL WORK TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN’S VIEWS ARE HEARD FIRST &#x26; LAST AND ARE CLEARLY INCORPORATED IN A COMMANDING WAY IN ANY AND ALL ACTION PLANS INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.</li>\n<li>I FURTHER PLEDGE … THAT I WILL BECOME A “PIONEER” IN GETTING WOMENCENTRIC VIEWS CLEARLY INTO THE MAINSTREAM—AND WILL WORK TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN’S REPRESENTATION IN ANY AND ALL LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IS AT LEAST CONSISTENT WITH THE SHAPE OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE OR WISH TO SERVE.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dressed for Success?

There are lots of sexy innovation strategies—I’ve championed many of them. But there’s also good, old-fashioned spending on R&#x26;D—and protecting-the-hell-out-of R&#x26;D in tough times.</li>\n<li><em>In big firms and small</em>. Aggressive R&#x26;D is not just the provenance of the big company. In fact, it is arguably more important to the 2-person Professional Service Firm than the lumbering giant.</li>\n<li><em>In every department</em>. AGGRESSIVE R&#x26;D IS AS IMPORTANT IN FINANCE and PURCHASING and HR and LOGISTICS as in IT or NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT!!!</li>\n<li><em>Throughout the “supply chain!”</em> Having vendors, suppliers, customers, etc., that are top-quartile in R&#x26;D spending in their industries is of the utmost importance.</li>\n<li><em>In Systems</em>! Innovative systems are as important as innovative products.</li>\n<li><em>By giving everyone “play” money—think “Micro-R&#x26;D.”</em> Giving everyone in the organization the opportunity to get their hands on a few bucks (and a mentor) in order to play around (right term) with a new idea is essential.</li>\n<li><em>By thinking “Venture Capital.”</em> Internal VC funds can run to billions of $$$ at an Intel, but the animating idea is to cast a wide, speculative net for potential investments. This could mean, for a restaurant owner, the likes of a $10,000 scholarship for a star-in-the-making chef to attend a topflight cooking course in France.</li>\n<li><em>By reaching out to universities</em>. Associations, large and small, with research universities are an important part of the innovative enterprise’s R&#x26;D strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Adhocracy—Love It or Leave It</strong>. In my experience, most truly innovative projects invent themselves, as opposed to being the product of a formal planning process; and their growth, too, is mostly organic, and constantly punctuated by odd twists and turns. An effective</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>culture of innovation, then, is largely ad hoc—which drives many traditional senior managers crazy. To them, “adhocracy” is little better than “mobocracy.” But if they can’t “get it,” they don’t belong.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Beyond Excellence: The “Berserk Standard.”</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon has changed the world.</li>\n<li>eBay has changed the world.</li>\n<li>Craigslist has changed the world—put about a zillion nails in the coffins of newspapers, among many other Richter 8.0+ things. Craigslist has more traffic than Amazon or eBay; though a private company, Craigslist has a projected market capitalization numbering in the billions of dollars.</li>\n<li>Amazon has 20,000 employees.</li>\n<li>eBay has 16,000 employees.</li>\n<li>Craigslist has … 30 employees.</li>\n<li>There is more than one way to skin a cat—even a thoroughly modern cat.</li>\n<li>Message: Never get seriously underway on a project of any sort until you’ve surfaced a couple of ideas that score perfect 10s, or at least 8s, on what I call … The Berserk Scale—e.g. 14,000 or 20,000 vs. 30.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Out of the Shadows: Skunkworks, Revisited</strong>. Lockheed invented the term “Skunk Works”—a small unit born in 1943 and based in Burbank, CA, that used a totally unconventional approach to developing essential military aircraft such as the famous SR-71 Blackbird spy plane, a pillar of our Cold War tactical package, in record time at minimum cost with maximum innovation executed by an astonishingly small group of astonishingly motivated people. (Their 1st project was the XP80, the 1st tactical jet fighter—75 guys, 143 days start to prototype.) I came across the Skunk Works in the early 1980s—and immediately fell madly in love. I had long been convinced that “normal pathways” would not yield innovation at Big Companies. And I was on the lookout for byways—places that stunk to the reigning bureaucrats. And Skunk Works, or Skunkworks as I prefer, filled the bill perfectly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>So the generic “Skunk Works idea” is a “band of brothers and sisters,” contrarian in nature and determined to do it their own way, who live in the netherworld, who stink-up-the-central-culture as they pursue what they believe is an earth-shattering dream. (Companies like Xerox and Apple have used these units to great—yes, earth-shattering—advantage.) The idea as we packaged it was picked up by numerous companies-e.g., a Pitney Bowes unit rented an unused restaurant about 12 miles from HQ, and a little team-of-more-or-less-freaks cobbled together a remarkable product in a few weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>S.A.V. (No, It’s Not a Kind of Truck.)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“If I had said ‘yes’ to all the projects I turned down and ‘no’ to all the ones I took, it would have worked out about the same.”—David Picker, movie studio exec, quoted in William Goldman’s</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>classic Adventures in the Screen Trade (cited by Caltech physics professor and author Leonard Mlodinow in The Drunkard’s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“Ever notice that ‘What the hell’ is always the right decision?”—a shrewd observation, attributed to an unknown Hollywood scriptwriter If, as I fervently believe … Randomness Rules Our Lives … then your … only (logical) … defense is-must be taking refuge in the message of the so-called “law of large numbers”—that is, any success follows from tryin’ enough stuff so that the odds of doin’ something right tilt your way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ultimate &#x26; Perhaps Only “Sure-fire” Winning Formula:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>S.A.V. = Screw Around Vigorously.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What Have You Prototyped Lately?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Effective prototyping may be the most valuable core competence an innovative organization can hope to have.”—Michael Schrage</li>\n<li>Fact: There is … ALWAYS … something … some little thing … you can start/do in the next … 30 minutes … to make a wee, concrete step forward toward solving a problem or creating a new opportunity. My colleagues and I call this the … “Quick Prototype Attitude.” MIT’s Michael Schrage tells us that innovation … is … the reaction to a prototype. To move forward, you must have some eighth-baked thing to talk about and shoot at and tinker with … ASAP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hell Hath No Fury: Celebrate “Disturbers of the Peace.”</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“What drove Trippe? A fury that the future was always being hijacked by people with smaller ideas—by his first partners who did not want to expand airmail routes; by nations that protected flag carriers with subsidies; by elitists who regarded flight, like luxury liners, as a privilege to be enjoyed only by the few; by cartel operators who rigged prices. The democratization he effected was as real as Henry Ford’s.” —Harold Evans, on legendary PanAm boss Juan Trippe</li>\n<li>I believe that the Mother of [Almost] All Innovation is … FURY. Abiding anger at the way things are… coupled with an “irrational” (statistically inappropriate) determination to beat back the innumerable protectors of the status quo and find and implement a better way.</li>\n<li>An innovator’s life, almost regardless of the size of the innovation (people fight the small ones about as tenaciously as the large ones), is pure hell. All guardians of the status quo are her enemies. That includes about 100 percent of her bosses, appointed stalwart custodians of “the way we do things around here.” Why is fury required? Simple: In order to survive the onslaught of these Powerful Guardians of Yesterday, and come out the other end in tact, she has to be really pumped up 100.00% of the time, and equipped with very thick skin indeed—that is, really truly pissed off with the way things are.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Innovation10: What We Know So Far</strong> … Libraries are full of books written about innovation. Nonetheless, I felt a pressing need here to devote an item to summarizing my four decades of noodling on this subject:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) <em>Try it. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat</em>. He who tries the most stuff wins.</li>\n<li>(2) <em>Prototype it</em>. A particular form of trying—some model of some part of “it” that everybody quickly has an opportunity shoot at.</li>\n<li>(3) <em>Celebrate failure</em>. Keyword: CELEBRATE. Not “tolerate,” but “celebrate”—if “most tries” are king, then “most failures” are necessarily crown prince.</li>\n<li>(4) <em>Hang Out Axiom</em>. Every “hang out” decision is an innovation decision: Yes. Or: No. That is, hang out with interesting, get more interesting. Hang out with ordinary, get more ordinary.</li>\n<li>(5) <em>Diversity</em>. That is, diversity on any damned dimension imaginable. In any and every situation. More variety = Higher odds of success!</li>\n<li>(6) <em>Parallel Universe</em>. Frequently the resistance to change is so strenuous that one must, in effect, give up on normal channels. So create a pretty-damn-separate “new world” (new folks, new location, new attitude, etc., etc.)—a parallel universe.</li>\n<li>(7) <em>XFX/Cross-functional Excellence</em>. Ninety percent (95 percent?) of innovation requires working across functional borders, so Border Bashing/X-border Love is key to innovation success.</li>\n<li>(8) <em>R&#x26;D Equality</em>. “Research” is not the exclusive provenance of the new product folks. Every department needs a well-funded, highly regarded R&#x26;D activity; the clear expectation is that every unit/function will be as well-known for its innovation record as for its execution of standard tasks.</li>\n<li>(9) <em>Hire and promote innovators</em>. The best test of innovation potential is … a track record in innovation. If you are assessing a 26-year-old candidate and there are no cases-of-innovationworth-bragging-about in his past—then don’t expect much in the future.</li>\n<li>(10) <em>Fun!</em> Innovating is about breaking the rules—often our rules. There is a certain mischievousness about innovative organizations—not fun &#x26; games, but pleasure in sticking a finger in convention’s eye, especially one or more of our own conventions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"listening\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#listening\" aria-label=\"listening permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>LISTENING</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Now Hear This!

Answer: Not by intellectual skill at calculating warhead (spear) trajectories, but by joining together in groups and outwitting and out-organizing the brutes. And what brought these groups of humans together? A brain that grew to accommodate: Gossip! As British evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar puts it, our brains expanded almost entirely to store social information.

So the premier soft skill of leadership the hard way is to cultivate the perspective of Marcus Aurelius: avoid busyness, free up your time, stay focused on what really matters. Let me put it bluntly: every leader should routinely keep a substantial portion of his or her time—I would say as much as 50 percent—unscheduled. Only when you have substantial ‘slop’ in your schedule—unscheduled time—will you have the space to reflect on what you are doing, learn from experience, and recover from your inevitable mistakes. Leaders without such free time end up tackling issues only when there is an immediate or visible problem. Managers’ typical response to my argument about free time is, ‘That’s all well and good, but there are things I have to do.’ Yet we waste so much time in unproductive activity—it takes an enormous effort on the part of the leader to keep free time for the truly important things.”</li>\n<li>The chapter’s second mind-ripping idea is labeled “The Discipline of Daydreaming”: “Nearly every major decision of my business career was, to some degree, the result of daydreaming. … To be sure, in every case I had to collect a lot of data, do detailed analysis, and make a data-based argument to convince superiors, colleagues and business partners. But that all came later. In the beginning, there was the daydream. By daydreaming, I mean loose, unstructured thinking with no particular goal in mind. … In fact, I think daydreaming is a distinctive mode of cognition especially well suited to the complex, ‘fuzzy’ problems that characterize a more turbulent business environment. … Daydreaming is an effective way of coping with complexity. When a problem has a high degree of complexity, the level of detail can be overwhelming. The more one focuses on the details, the more one risks being lost in them. … Every child knows how to daydream. But many, perhaps most, lose the capacity as they grow up. …”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Master the Art of Milestoning</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My latest trip from VT to MA (173.6 mi) got me thinking of something else besides pit stops. I was running late, and noting my progress via odometer and various landmarks and highway markers. As my mood went up and down I realized (re-realized?) the power of manageable goals in every form of activity:\n<ul>\n<li>(1) Milestones are all-important, no matter how trivial or repetitive the task.</li>\n<li>(2) “Milestoning” is a real art for reasons psychological, as much as or more than for reasons of “substance.”</li>\n<li>(3) Truly trivial milestones are often meaningless, even if they are “accomplishments” of a sort and “milestones” of a sort—scoring the eyedrop’s distance from the Dorset turn to the Stratton turn is no big deal and not really a motivator.</li>\n<li>(4) “Milestone power” is variable. E.g., at the beginning or near the end of a task, the apparently trivial can indeed seem utterly grand. “Well, I’ve done something”—that’s what I feel seconds after 4 a.m. when I make it to the immediate end of the farm road that starts at our house, thus putting behind me the first click, or 0.7 miles, in numbing reality a scant 0.4 percent of the whole.</li>\n<li>(5) There is a definite sweetspot … “the perfect milestone.” The 13 miles from home to Dorset, or the 12 miles from Gill to Erving, is a winner—substantial enough to matter, to merit a pumped fist at 4:23 a.m., and to constitute “progress of note.”</li>\n<li>(6) There is a fine line between “trivial” on the one end and “daunting” on the other. (A 27-mile stretch, if thought of that way, is downright discouraging: “Dear God, these 27 miles of Route 2 are frigging endless.“) Action: Become a “milestone activist.” Use milestoning, for instance, on every project, large or small, as a matter of routine, but do so with the greatest care, as only partially explained above— that is, become a Milestone Professional as well as a Milestone Activist. These project landmarks, the establishment and celebration thereof, can have an enormous impact on the energy and motivation of a team.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"design\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#design\" aria-label=\"design permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>DESIGN</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Design Is … Everywhere!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Design” means the string of gorgeous products from Apple or OXO or Herman Miller or John Deere.

This gorgeous little hammer, actually the … Tuf-E-Nuf Mini Striker Stubby Claw Hammer … is a true innovation, even an earth-shattering innovation. (By my lights.) The head looks like and has the heft of a regular heavy hammer. But the full-diameter handle is only five inches long, half the normal length. And the grip is great, up to the standard of the easy-to-hold OXO kitchen tool line.

That is, mimic Commerce Bank by creating formal processes for Identifying Grunge and Removing Grunge and getting everyone in on the … Great Grunge Removal Game. Think of it at an even higher level of abstraction as a “Strategic” “Grunge Removal Culture,” a full-blown philosophy supported by a formal infrastructure to try to keep the “inevitable grunge growth” in check or even reversed—and headed, of course, by the CGRO/Chief Grunge Removal Officer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The 1% Drill: Clearing Away a World of “Slop” in Just 45 Minutes.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I co-presented an all-day in-company seminar in the UK several years ago. At about 2 p.m. the principal presenter called an abrupt halt to proceedings, and said, “I want to make sure I earn out my full fee today, and then some. We’re going to stop and do a 45-minute exercise.” He explained that any operation can at any time cut 1% of its budget. (We all have flab, regardless of circumstances—not many 6 percent BMIs around.) The leader then broke the group up by function. He gave the sub-groups 30 minutes on the dot to identify their team’s 1 percent. Then he had each group report in public for 2 or 3 minutes—this public recitation, he told me, raised the odds of execution; it also provided others with ideas. Indeed the groups readily identified their 1 percent and reported accordingly—there was actually no bitching.</li>\n<li>1%? No small thing, regardless of business size.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goal: To Make “Common Sense” More Common</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A lot of the giant financialeconomic mess we’re in can be chalked up to a failure of common sense, often by the so-called best of the best and brightest of the bright, egging each other on with a series of implicit “I dare yous.” We are all, in fact, “insiders” in our own worlds—and we all too often lose touch with reality to a lesser or greater extent. There are a host of things one can do to deal with this, but in this instance I only want to suggest routinely running proposals or budgets, or whatever, by a</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Common Sense Ombudsman.” Said ombudsman could be a spouse or a neighbor who owns a restaurant or the down-to-earth woman running the distribution center in South Podunk who you chatted with at the management meeting in Orlando last year.

As China and Russia, among others, make their move in energy, state-run companies are eclipsing the major independents. Aiding these new players, at the center of the Schlumberger “empire,” is a relatively new outfit, reminiscent of IBM’s enormous Global Services unit (these days, Global Services = IBM) and UPS Logistics’ teams, which run entire supply chains for enormous companies. The Schlumberger version is called IPM, for Integrated Project Management. It lives</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>in a nondescript building near Gatwick Airport, and its chief says it will do “just about anything an oilfield owner would want, from drilling to production.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As I see it, Schlumberger is transforming itself pell-mell into what may become the biggest and most powerful “PSF” (Professional Service Firm) in history. Moreover, paths like this, from IBM and UPS and Schlumberger, are open to many firms. Think Best Buy’s “Geek Squads,” the mobile service units that are Best Buy’s competitive advantage in electronics retailing; or the “PSF” components of many giant GE “industrial” units, which produce well over 50 percent of the units’ revenues; even the likes of MasterCard are getting into the act—MasterCard Advisors are running entire payment systems activities for some of their clients, penetrating ever more deeply into the heart of the Clients’ operations.</li>\n<li>In view of all this, one of my “Top 5” Tom Rants is urging every “department” in an organization to re-conceive itself as a turnkey-service, de facto or de jure profit-making “PSF.” And, likewise, I urge companies of all flavors to consider aiming to grow through “PSF-ing”—more or less</li>\n</ul>\n<p>along the lines of the Schlumberger-IBM-UPS-GE-MasterCard transformations. In short, I\nbelieve the “Professional Service Firm Idea” is central to many firms’, including or especially small ones, potential to differentiate themselves in today’s and tomorrow’s increasingly competitive environment. In particular, these “PSFs” can offer differentiated services limited only by their imagination—who would have thought that the “Geek Squads” would have led the way to re-positioning giant Best Buy?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t Let the “Enemy” Rule Your Life.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Obsessing about your competitors, trying to match or best their offerings, spending time each day wanting to know what they are doing, and/or measuring your company against them—these activities have no great or winning outcome. Instead you are simply prohibiting your company from finding its own way to be truly meaningful to its Clients, staff and prospects. You block your company from finding its own identity and engaging with the people who pay the bills. … Your competitors have never paid your bills and they never will.”—Howard Mann, Your Business Brickyard: Getting Back to the Basics to Make Your Business More Fun to Run</li>\n<li>Mr. Mann in turn quotes Mike McCue, former VP/Technology at Netscape: “At Netscape the</li>\n</ul>\n<p>competition with Microsoft was so severe, we’d wake up in the morning thinking about how we were going to deal with them instead of how we would build something great for our customers. What I realize now is that you can never, ever take your eye off the customer. Even in the face of massive competition, don’t think about the competition. Literally don’t think about them.” Don’t let the “enemy” rule your life. Try your damnedest to follow the exact advice of Mr. McCue: “Literally don’t think about them.” Far, far easier said than done, no doubt, but selfawareness is a start:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We … are the problem.</li>\n<li>They are … not … the problem.</li>\n<li>We have one source only of Excellence: Us.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Love Your Competitors.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the top of my business priority list is a desire for my overall market to grow by leaps and bounds! Sure, as the number of people giving speeches and seminars and writing books and blogging and tweeting on similar topics has leapt, my “market share” has</li>\n</ul>\n<p>gone w-a-y down. (It was about 100 percent after In Search of Excellence, when I was more or less the only public “management guru.“) But my revenue has soared in the process—the “smaller share of a much bigger pie” axiom.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moreover, I want (am desperate that) my competitors to do terrific work! If they do, the “guru” industry’s stock as a whole, which is sometimes wobbly, will rise. In short, I want my competitors to thrive.</li>\n<li>Does all this suggest an altruistic streak? Perhaps. But mostly not. To begin with, I think that when one badmouths or attempts to diminish one’s competitors in any way or tries to limit their activities, the “word gets around.” And one develops a reputation as prickly and egocentric—and, well, as a selfish jerk.</li>\n<li>More important: <em>I think (I know!) the only effective long-term defense against the competition (think Apple versus its stalwart competitors) is to do better and unique work—and to earn and to retain the custom of those who are interested in the things I worry about.</em></li>\n<li>“Win” with a remarkably better product.</li>\n<li>“Win” with deeper relationships.</li>\n<li>“Win” when your industry is prospering and has a good reputation.</li>\n<li>Build up your competitors!!</li>\n<li>Build up your entire industry!!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL SECTION: The Top 50 “Have-Yous”</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>While waiting in the Albany airport to board a Southwest Airlines flight to Reagan one morning, I happened across the latest Harvard Business Review, on the cover of which was a bright yellow “lead article” sticker. On it were the words “Mapping your competitive position.” It triggered a furious negative “Tom reaction,” as my wife calls it. Of course I believe you should worry about your “competitive position.” But instead of obsessing on competitive position and other abstractions, as the B.Schools and consultants would invariably have us do, I instead wondered about some “practical stuff,” which I believe is far, far more important to the short- and longterm “strategic” health of the enterprise, tiny or enormous. Hence, rather than an emphasis on competitive maps or looking for a “blue ocean” (empty space, per the popular book Blue Ocean Strategy), I urge you to pay attention to my Top 50 “Have Yous.” The underlying hypothesis, of course, is that if you proactively do the “small” stuff below, your “competitive position” will improve so much that mapping will become a secondary issue!</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have you in the last 10 days … visited a customer?</li>\n<li>Have you called a customer … TODAY?</li>\n<li>Have you in the last 60-90 days … had a seminar in which several folks from the customer’s operation (different levels, different functions) interacted, via facilitator, with various of your folks?</li>\n<li>Have you thanked a front-line employee for a small act of helpfulness … in the last three days?</li>\n<li>Have you thanked a front-line employee for a small act of helpfulness … in the</li>\n<li>t three hours?</li>\n<li>Have you thanked a frontline employee for carrying around a great attitude … today?</li>\n<li>Have you in the last week recognized—publicly—one of your folks for a small act of crossfunctional co-operation?</li>\n<li>Have you in the last week recognized—publicly—one of “their” folks (another function) for a small act of cross-functional co-operation?</li>\n<li>Have you invited in the last month a leader of another function to your weekly team priorities meeting?</li>\n<li>Have you personally in the last week-month called-visited an internal or external customer to sort out, inquire, or apologize for some little or big thing that went awry?</li>\n<li>Have you in the last two days had a chat with someone (a couple of levels down?) about specific deadlines concerning a project’s next steps?</li>\n<li>Have you in the last two days had a chat with someone (a couple of levels down?) about specific deadlines concerning a project’s next steps … and what specifically you can do to remove a hurdle?

My usage is not intended to be religious in any formal sense—hence the lowercase “c.” But, in terms of human potential (quasi-religious?), I do see all effective organizations as driven … first and foremost … by an Unstinting Commitment to Members’ Growth.</li>\n<li>A classroom in a primary school should … obviously … be such a “cathedral.” But so, too, an accounting or training department. No doubt of it: Organizations must effectively serve their external customers to survive, let alone thrive. But my line-of-logic is, at least to me, crystal clear and admits no alternatives: <em>The odds of the external customer being served effectively and in a way that binds them to your organization is a direct function of such service being provided by those [employees] who are themselves Engaged in a Vigorous Quest for Growth and Excellence.</em></li>\n<li>NB: This challenge—organization as cathedral devoted to human development—is simply</li>\n</ul>\n<p>gargantuan, and one I thought about a lot before issuing. And by now I’ve tested the idea all over the world—from Dubai to New Delhi to Helsinki to Joinville, Brazil, to San Antonio. In sit-down discussions there is agreement that “If not this, what?” is, in fact, a sane question—at least worthy of serious conversation. I am wholeheartedly convinced that something like this makes commercial sense. (And, I repeat, if not, what’s the alternative?)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enable Dreams. (If Not, What?)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Matthew Kelly’s parable-based The Dream Manager is not ordinarily my kind of book. But Kelly’s premise got to me—and it has become a centerpiece of my work. The idea is simple: <em>Everyone has a dream!</em> And if we can help him and her fulfill those dreams then he and she will be more engaged human beings—which will, practically speaking, pay off for the organization as it strives to serve its customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kelly writes: <em>“A company’s purpose is to become the-best-version-of-itself. But an organization can only become the-best-version-of-itself to the extent that the people who drive that organization are striving to become better-versions-of-themselves.”</em> When you ponder that, it is both obvious and profound: “We,” the team, is only as good as the engagement of and commitment to personal growth and achievement and Excellence by each and every individual. (Obvious in football and dance—why not groceries and the accounting office?) “The question is,” Kelly continues, <em>“What is an employee’s purpose? Most would say, ‘to help the company achieve its purpose’—but they would be wrong. [Ponder, slowly, again.] That is certainly part of the employee’s role, but an employee’s primary purpose is to become the-best-version-of-himself or herself.”</em> As stated, the book title is Dream Manager. In fact, Kelly asserts that explicitly helping</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>people achieve their dreams—directly business-related or not—is a, or even the, primary task a boss has. The boss, to both serve her customer or get things done in general, becomes a “dream enabler”—e.g., works with the 28-year-old maintenance man from Ghana to achieve his dream of a junior college degree.

And, near the 200th anniversary of his singular victory at Trafalgar, I happened upon a new biography (I’ve probably ingested a dozen over the years), Andrew Lambert’s Nelson: Britannia’s God of War. From it, I extracted 13 lessons that I contend are mostly applicable to you and me:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Simple scheme.</em> Nelson’s orders of battle were paragons of simplicity and clarity—he was a damn good writer among other things. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Soaring/Bold/Noble Purpose!</em> Nelson pursued total victory. Many of his peers were willing, sentially, to rate surviving as victory enough. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Engage others.</em> Nelson made his captains full partners in the process as he devised plans — heard of in those days. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Find great talent, at any age</em>, let it soar! Nelson gave his best captains, young or old, far more leeway than his counterpart admirals—and he eschewed seniority as primary measure of assigned responsibility. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Lead by Love!</em> The sailors, every biographer agrees, loved Nelson, and he them. (Last clause in the sentence is crucial.) His concern for their well-being, regardless of the rough nature of the sailor’s life in those days, was legendary. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Seize the Moment!</em> Nelson’s sixth sense about enemy weakness was remarkable. He would skip to “Plan B” in a flash if merited by changing circumstances. (Doable for you or me? Yes. More or less—“good instincts” are the indirect product of insanely hard work.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Vigor!</em> His energy was palpable! (Doable for you or me? Yes. Mostly. Low energy folks aren’t picks for leadership positions—or any other positions, for that matter.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Master your craft.</em> Nelson was the best damn sailor in the Navy—sailors and officers appreciated that beyond measure. (Doable for you or me? Yes. Damn it. We are not all created equal—but often “the best” is not the one who tops the charts on raw talent.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Work harder-harder-harder</em> than the next person. No explanation needed. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Show the way, walk the talk, exude confidence! Start a Passion Epidemic!</em> Nelson led from the front—visible, in full dress uniform as the cannons roared. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Change the rules:</em> Create your own game! Nelson always took the initiative—thus forcing rivals, from the beginning and throughout maneuvering at battle, to be in a full-time reactive mode. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Luck!</em> Believe it! Always necessary! Not “desirable”—but necessary. (Doable for you or me?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ybody can get lucky—and preparedness ups the odds of getting lucky. But, truthfully, lucky is lucky.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Be determined to come out on top, come hell or/and high water!</em> Lambert: other Admirals were more frightened of losing than anxious to win.” This last is a big deal—it belongs as either #1 or #13. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A Cheat Sheet for Tough Times. (and Other Times, Too.)</strong> Amid all of the advice “out there” on dealing with difficult circumstances, how do you … boil it all down? Some thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) Be conscious in the Zen sense. Carefully consider, far more than you normally might, how you project: Does your “energetic” approach, for example, look more like panic? Is</li>\n</ul>\n<p>your smile in place—nothing is amusing about tough economic times, but a permanently grim demeanor, even if it’s merited, is a guaranteed de-motivator. Etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(2) Meet … daily, first thing … with your leadership team—to discuss whatever, check assumptions. Perhaps meet again late afternoon. Meetings max 30 minutes, maybe 15.</li>\n<li>(3) If you are a “big boss,” use a 100-percent trusted, private sounding board—check in daily, whether you “need to” … or not.</li>\n<li>(4) Concoct scenarios by the bushel, test ‘em, play with ‘em, short-term, long-term, sane, insane. (Not necessarily a formal exercise—but a constant “playful” exercise.)</li>\n<li>(5) MBWA (Manage by Wandering Around). Wander. Sample attitudes. Visible but not frenzied. But visible … visible … visible.</li>\n<li>(6) Work the phones, chat up experts, non-experts, customers, vendors. Seek enormous diversity of opinion. (NB: Big bosses invariably spend too much time with “experts”! Expert = Blinders = Particularly bad in uncertain/ambiguous times.)</li>\n<li>(7) “Over”communicate!!!!!</li>\n<li>(8) Exercise—encourage your leadership team to double up on their physical exercise; physical sharpness is insanely important to mental evenness.</li>\n<li>(9) Underscore “EXCELLENCE in every transaction”! (Now, more than ever!)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"big\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#big\" aria-label=\"big permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“BIG”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Think Legacy!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“My life is my message.”—Gandhi</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LEGACY!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It can be a beautiful word!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Why I mattered.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(What I left behind that lasted.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But I urge you also to think of it as a continuous goal.

I divide the world into the learners and non-learners’.</p>\n<p>People in a growth mindset don’t just seek challenge, they thrive on it.</p>\n<p>We gave fifth graders intriguing puzzles, which they all loved. But when we made them harder, children with the fixed mindset showed a big plunge in enjoyment.</p>\n<p>For [people with a growth mindset] it’s not about immediate perfection. It’s about learning something over time: confronting a challenge and making progress.</p>\n<p>‘Becoming is better than being’. The fixed mindset does not allow people the luxury of becoming. They have to already be.</p>\n<p>People with the growth mindset know that it takes time for potential to flower.</p>\n<p>College students, after doing poorly on a test, were given a chance to look at tests of other students. Those in the growth mindset looked at the tests of people who had done far better than they had. As usual, they wanted to correct their deficiency. But students in the fixed mindset chose to look at the tests of people who had done really poorly. That was their way of feeling better about themselves.</p>\n<p>John Wooden, the legendary basketball coach, says you aren’t a failure until you start to blame. What he means is that you can still be in the process of learning from your mistakes until you deny them.</p>\n<p>French executive Pierre Chevalier says, ‘We are not a nation of effort. After all, if you have savoir-faire [a mixture of know-how and cool], you do things effortlessly’.</p>\n<p>People with the growth mindset, however, believe something very different. For them, even geniuses have to work hard for their achievements.</p>\n<p>They may appreciate endowment, but they admire effort, for no matter what your ability is, effort is what ignites that ability and turns it into accomplishment.</p>\n<p>The growth mindset does allow people to love what they’re doing—and to continue to love it in the face of difficulties.</p>\n<p>Those with the growth mindset found success in doing their best, in learning and improving. And this is exactly what we find in the champions.</p>\n<p>Those with the growth mindset found setbacks motivating. They’re informative. They’re a wake-up call.</p>\n<p>People with the growth mindset in sports (as in pre-med chemistry) took charge of the processes that bring success—and that maintain it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://parentotheca.com/2020/12/21/carol-dweck-mindset-book-summary/\">https://parentotheca.com/2020/12/21/carol-dweck-mindset-book-summary/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/psychology/mindset/\">https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/psychology/mindset/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.getstoryshots.com/books/mindset-summary/\">https://www.getstoryshots.com/books/mindset-summary/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.deanbokhari.com/mindset-summary/\">https://www.deanbokhari.com/mindset-summary/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tompeters.com/docs/The_Little_BIG_Things_Compressed.pdf\">https://tompeters.com/docs/The_Little_BIG_Things_Compressed.pdf</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"mindset new psychology of success by Carol summary","date":"July 25, 2022","description":"mindset new psychology of success by Carol summary"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/miracle-morning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"miracle morning by El Harod summary"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/on-civilization-and-china/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"on civilization and china By Lilu summary"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"df1046fe-8798-59d2-bc15-d3f741d8a5d5","previousPostId":"5fa216cc-0b65-57da-8b03-e5d0326e6130","nextPostId":"f67ed079-07ad-5e48-924c-16522eda48dd"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}

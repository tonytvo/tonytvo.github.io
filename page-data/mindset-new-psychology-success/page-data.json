People with the fixed mindset view failure as intolerable, and spend much of their time trying to prove to themselves and others how smart and/or talented they are. They do not believe in the power of effort.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>growth mindset</strong> is the belief that with hard work and experience, growth and development occur. This mindset creates a desire to learn. Those with the growth mindset see failure as an opportunity to learn, and they value risk-taking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>fixed mindsets prevent growth</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>People with a Fixed Mindset are often worried about what other people think. As they often judge others based on their aptitude for a task, they also assume others judge them all the time. Hence, people with a Fixed Mindset are obsessed with showing how talented and smart they are. In fact, Carol suggests that those with a Fixed Mindset revolve their whole personality around their talent. Subsequently, they need approval from others to protect their personalities and egos.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>growth mindsets encourage development</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The sky’s the limit for people like this, as they are always seeking to find new ways to learn. Importantly, individuals with Growth Mindsets are not fixated on being better than other people or receiving the best grades. These individuals obtain satisfaction from pushing themselves to the limit to help themselves grow. They will practice relentlessly and are aware that you have to work your hardest, and overcome some failures, to improve.</li>\n<li>People with a Growth Mindset enjoy being around people who are more skilled than them. They see spending time with more talented individuals as opportunities to learn new skills. Additionally, these people are always willing to discard a strategy if it is no longer working and replace it with a new approach.</li>\n<li>As well as improving themselves, individuals with a growth mindset encourage the surrounding people to continue learning and working on themselves. They understand that life is about working as a team. When others are happier or more successful, they are more likely to succeed themselves. As business owners, individuals with a Growth Mindset are respectful to their team members and grateful for their work. Additionally, they are open to others’ opinions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>fixed mindsets seek approval; growth mindsets seek development</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lou Gerstner took over IBM when it was similarly in a difficult spot. The environment was in a Fixed Mindset and wasting energy on internal disagreements. Each employee was merely doing what was best for themselves. Subsequently, the company was not meeting its customer needs. Gerstner changed this by breaking down the company’s hierarchy, emphasizing teamwork, and rewarding employees who supported their coworkers. Additionally, he put himself on the same level as his employees. This allowed him to engage with as many employees as possible. Gerstner was adopting a Growth Mindset, and this enabled shared development.</li>\n<li>Gerstner’s Growth Mindset enabled him to create a new work environment based on teamwork and development. The focus moved away from individuals’ success and towards shared development. He was able to bring about lasting success at IBM.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed Mindsets See Failures as Disasters; Growth Mindsets See Failures as Opportunities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact of Your Mindset</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Carol explains that individuals with a Fixed Mindset do not believe they can learn from their mistakes. Any failure is used as justification for their future being filled with failures. Additionally, any defeat cancels out all the individual’s previous successes. As this approach diminishes their self-confidence, Fixed Mindsets will often blame other people or circumstances for their failures. Alternatively, they will seek ways to cheat to get ahead. Instead of analyzing their weaknesses and improving based on their failures, they try to forget. These behaviors are underpinned by Fixed Mindsets believing that they are the finished product rather than a continual process.</li>\n<li>Carol provides basketball legend Michael Jordan as an example of an individual with a Growth Mindset. Although Jordan is arguably the greatest sportsman ever to live, he was imperfect. He missed some dunks, and he missed some game-winning shots. However, the critical matter is how Jordan responded to these misses. After making mistakes, he would practice the missed shot over and over again. Jordan’s ability to learn from his mistakes and practice these weaknesses brought him so much success. Jordan did not find fault in his teammates or his shoes for his own mistakes. Additionally, it is well-known that Jordan was a driving force behind his teammates’ improvements. Jordan wanted his teammates to be the best they could be. So, he always supported them in improving their game.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed Mindsets Avoid Difficulties; Growth Mindsets Relish Difficulties</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>While people with a Fixed Mindset get a thrill from easy things, people with a Growth Mindset get a thrill from what is complex. Fixed Mindsets struggle with difficult situations because they have to invest in making a positive outcome out of these situations. Effort is fundamental to success. However, people with a Fixed Mindset see situations where they have to spend more time and energy as a risk. The more time or energy they invest in a situation, the harder it becomes to blame external factors if they fail. The Fixed Mindsets avoid difficult situations as they do not want to question their talent or potentially make a fool of themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>THE GROWTH MINDSET BUILDS CHARACTER—A KEY COMPONENT TO SUCCESS.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Character comes from the growth mindset and the idea that when things go wrong, there are effective strategies that can be used to cope with or overcome them. Character gives a person the ability to keep going even when things get really difficult. It is the ability to stretch yourself beyond what you think is humanly possible, to maintain focus and positivity when things get unbearable, and to consistently work hard.</li>\n<li>Those with the fixed mindset focus on proving that they are better than everyone else, while those with the growth mindset strive only to be the best they can possibly be.  They figure out and take the steps necessary to succeed and to keep succeeding. Many great athletes shared that they have found more fulfillment in personal growth than in winning or achieving fame.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"childhood-role-models-define-our-mindset\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#childhood-role-models-define-our-mindset\" aria-label=\"childhood role models define our mindset permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Childhood role models define our mindset</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>impact of your parents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our mindsets start developing from birth. However, all babies are born with a Growth Mindset. Babies are curious about the world and want to learn and grow as much as possible each day. Therefore, it is the child’s environment growing up that determines whether the child maintains this Growth desire or eventually adopts a Fixed mindset. The most crucial agent in this shift is usually your parents. Parents have their mindset, and this will set an example for their children.</li>\n<li>Parents with a Growth Mindset will encourage their children to continue learning and questioning everything. Comparatively, parents with a Fixed Mindset will parent through judgment, punishment, and telling the children what is right and wrong. These parenting styles impact babies as young as 1. For example, babies with a Growth Mindset will help other babies when they are crying. In contrast, babies with a Fixed Mindset are annoyed when other babies are crying.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Impact of Your Teachers</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to parents, teachers are also fundamental role models in defining children’s mindsets. Some teachers adopt a Fixed Mindset by believing the ability of their students is unchangeable. In effect, they believe that some children are naturally intelligent, and others are destined to fail. However, there are many good teachers, also. These teachers will adopt a Growth Mindset by believing all their students are capable of learning anything. The teaching style of these teachers is more adaptable and places faith in the students. Generally, this teaching style helps all students perform better, even those who seemed doomed to fail.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"anyone-can-adopt-a-growth-mindset\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#anyone-can-adopt-a-growth-mindset\" aria-label=\"anyone can adopt a growth mindset permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Anyone can adopt a growth mindset</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>moving towards growth mindsets</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A journey towards a Growth Mindset also opens opportunities for developing concrete life plans. Developing a Growth Mindset will take time and the support of others around us. Therefore, we want supportive and honest people who are willing to talk to us about our mistakes and weaknesses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>breaking away from fixed mindsets</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breaking away from a Fixed Mindset can be particularly challenging. Fixed Mindsets are habits we have built over many years to protect us emotionally from our failures. Additionally, a lot of us will be reliant on our Fixed Mindset for our self-confidence. Suppose you are genuinely struggling to kick your Fixed Mindset. In that case, Carol suggests that adopting the Growth Perspective in certain situations is enough to have a positive impact. For example, you might accept you are terrible at sport. Despite this, you will apply a Growth Perspective to the most important things: Work, parenting, or studying. Additionally, you don’t only possess one mindset. Most people have elements of both that apply to different areas of their life. Therefore, your first task is to identify which areas you possess which mindset.</li>\n<li>Carol outlines that a Growth Mindset helps make the impossible possible. She encourages each of us to look at the most successful people globally and consider how they would respond to failure. Likely, you will find that they used failures along the way to reach their success.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Some Have Greater Opportunities, but We All Have a Chance</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It would be naive to say that effort is the only thing that’s important in succeeding. Effort is significant and is why those with a Growth Mindset increase their chances of success. Though, many other factors influence your chances of success. For example, Carol explains that resources and opportunities are useful for success. Those born into influential families with better access to education have a much higher chance of success. However, although your starting point matters, this does not mean you shouldn’t improve and create the best endpoint possible based on your opportunities</li>\n<li>Importantly, Carol concludes by stating that a Growth Mindset does not mean we should try to improve everything. Sometimes the wisest decision is to accept our imperfections, especially those that will cause little harm.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>applying the growth and fixed mindsets to business</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The most successful business managers are not natural talents who ooze ego. Instead, they are the individual who is continuously looking to learn. They are also willing to ask questions and are not afraid to fail in front of their employees. They keep faith in their team to improve when they have made a mistake, rather than deeming them failures.</li>\n<li>In contrast, Fixed Mindset bosses are dangerous. They often seek to be controlling and abusive to showcase their superiority. These behaviors push their fellow employees to adopt Fixed Mindsets, as well. Hence, instead of moving forward through learning, the company will be fixated on individual goals. Additionally, they will aim to obtain short-term goals by covering up mistakes and screwing other people over.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Applying the Growth and Fixed Mindsets to Love</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relationships can often be complicated, and most of us will have multiple failed romantic relationships throughout our life. Individuals with a Fixed Mindset see these failed relationships as a defining feature of themselves. They label themselves as unlovable and want revenge for the rejection they have experienced. People with a Growth Mindset will also find rejection difficult. However, they will also see it as an opportunity to reflect on where things went wrong in the relationship</li>\n<li>Additionally, the two mindsets have different levels of success in relationships. Relationships based on Fixed Mindsets are destined to fail, as both parties will be expecting everything to be perfect with no effort. Additionally, both parties believe that love can solve everything</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>3 actions for you</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Think about how you can put yourself into a growth mindset more often. What triggers your fixed mindset and how you can deal with it?</li>\n<li>When praising your children, praise effort and progress</li>\n<li>Think about how you can demonstrate growth mindset to your children</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"little-big-things\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#little-big-things\" aria-label=\"little big things permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Little Big Things</h1>\n<h2 id=\"little\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#little\" aria-label=\"little permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“LITTLE”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It’s All About the Restrooms!</strong> A sparkling restroom with family photos in a small</li>\n</ul>\n<p>restaurant in Gill MA shouts “We care.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“Small Stuff” Matters.

First, that creates the perception that “they aren’t dilly-dallyin’“—motion matters. Second, the cure is anything but sure—so one must get moving if for no other reason than to see what happens when the system is perturbed.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s The Black</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swan was an extraordinarily well-timed book. The black swan is an unpredictable event. If it’s unpredictable, what, then, if anything, can we do about it? One answer is create “resilient enterprises” staffed with people in all positions who have exhibited a disposition for resilience. While we can hardly afford “redundant everything,” policies and processes and projects and training aimed at increased resilience are very much possible—e.g., Microsoft helped employees equip their home offices when it appeared the swine flu might restrict the # of folks working in standard offices for a lengthy period.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lifetime Employment Is Dead.

Although labor costs are a substantial part of any hospital budget, the interactions themselves add nothing to the budget.</li>\n<li>“Kindness is free.”</li>\n<li>“Listening to patients or answering their questions costs nothing. It could be argued that negative interactions—alienating patients, being unresponsive to their needs, or limiting their sense of control—can be very costly. Angry, frustrated, or frightened patients may be combative, withdrawn, and less cooperative—requiring far more time than it would have taken to interact with them initially in a positive way.”</li>\n<li>This has become a centerpiece of my work. In the commercial sphere I encompass it with an equation:\n<ul>\n<li>K = R = P. : Kindness = Repeat business = Profit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>That is, among other things, kindness is the ultimate “hard” variable affecting the bottom line.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Listen to Ann—and “Act Accordingly.”</strong> The late Texas governor Ann Richards tells us</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>that despite ire, or even fury, at a service mixup, you must remember that the frontline person you are dealing with is the … only person on earth … who can help you.

While the stakes are much lower for you or me, the cost or benefit of\npresentation skills is nonetheless enormous within our local context.\n18\nMy obsession with bugging others about primacy of top-tier presentation skills started late, after I\nsat at dinner, in 2007, next to a “Top 25” exec at a Fortune 25 company, an outfit known for its\n“just the facts” approach to decision making. We were chatting about this, that, and the other, and\nat one point he said to me, out of the blue, “I work like hell developing guys for the top, and say\nI’ve got four guys who’ve performed well and could move up. I’ll swear, two or three, or\nsometimes all four, will drop off the track as a direct result of lousy presentation skills.”\nI know this chap well, and he’s a naturally reticent genius engineer whose speaking skills were\nmarginal until he applied, over a period of years, his matchless willpower—and brute force—to\ntraining/improving himself.</p>\n<p>WORK</p>\n<ol start=\"45\">\n<li>On Being a “Professional.” Think “professional,” and what words come to mind?

These sorts of professionals share certain\ncharacteristics such as: student of their craft, dedicated to a “calling,” pursuing constant\nimprovement, master of a defined body of knowledge. My effort in many sections of the book is\nto expand, or even re-define, the idea of “professional” to include several bedrock areas of\nbehavior, the effective practice of which determines success or failure in getting things done. For\nexample:\n• Saying “Thank you” (Mastering the Practice of Appreciation)\n• Apologizing (Repairing frayed relationships)\n• Listening (Hearing and Absorbing others’ views)\n• Achieving peace and prosperity among warring organizational tribes (turning crossfunctional integration into Strategic Weapon #1)\nEach of these items can be studied and can be mastered—with about as much practice as is\nrequired to achieve mastery in painting or molecular biology.

Bottom line:\nEverything passes through Finance.\nTheir business is your business.\nStop pissing and moaning about their world.\nInvest in appreciation of their world.\n47. What’s on the Agenda?

One very\nbig part of the problem-opportunity comes in the form of what I call “the all-important threeminute call.” That is, address the problem early, before the tipping point, with what amounts to no\nmore than a smidgen of effort—and avoid immeasurable pain down the pike.\nIn short, a three-minute call made today (NOW!) to deal with a “slightly” bruised ego or a\n“minor” misunderstanding can go a long way toward helping you avoid a trip to divorce court,\nthe loss of a billion-dollar Client (lots of evidence for this), or an employee lawsuit tomorrow.\nAnd it can be and usually is, even more powerful than it seems. In 9 of 10 cases, the call goes far,\nfar better than you anticipated it would. (The fact that you took the initiative accounts for a lot.)\nNot only does “the call” help “deal with” a thorny problem, but surprisingly often it launches a\nnew and positive trajectory for a fraying relationship.\nThe issue, of course is the will to “just do it”—which at times means swallowing your pride and\nseems to be much tougher for boys than girls. Part of the answer, my frequent answer in The\nLittle BIG Things, is “working at it.” That is, I’d argue that “making the three-minute call” is at\nleast as worthy of study and practice as learning to play a piano or build a fine cabinet: Nations\nrise or fall, battles are won or lost, based on (1) not making the call, or (2) making the call\noccasionally, or (3) making the call routinely, as a matter of habit, and with abiding skill.\n50. Show Up! (It’s a Start) Woody Allen famously said that “Eighty percent of success is\nshowing up.” It’s a good laugh line—and unchallengeable. It’s true for me and you—and true in\ncircumstances of the greatest import. In 1787 in the U.S., delegates came to Philadelphia to draft\nour enduring, as it turned out, Constitution. The smallest of all the states, Delaware, may have\ngreater influence than any other state. They took the effort seriously (some, such as New York,\ndidn’t). Delaware sent a big delegation, they showed up every day (most others didn’t) and\nmembers volunteered to do every damn thing imaginable—and in the end it paid off, big time.\n20\nHence I conclude that “Woody’s strategy” works in an office of five people—and when the fate of\na nation is at stake. As I said … Big Time.\n51. Get Up Earlier Than the Next (in This Case) Gal. I was flying to Boston from London\non a Saturday morning. It was a seven-hour flight. A professional woman was sitting in front of\nme. I duly swear, she did not look up once during the entire flight. She produced more on her\nlaptop in those seven hours than I do in a week. Or a month.\nThere’s something to say for out-working “the other guy”—or woman. In short, I would give both\nmy right and left arms to have the woman described above on my side—and, God help me, not on\nthe other side!\n52. Make an Insane Public Effort. The late sports super-agent Mark McCormack (once voted\nthe most powerful man in sports) once condoned and even certified one of my own crazy habits.\nHe said there are times, not necessarily infrequent, when it is wise-imperative to travel 5,000\nmiles for a 5-minute meeting. It was a tactic I started using in 1974, when I was a junior White\nHouse staffer working on drug abuse issues. And the power and effectiveness thereof are literally\nbeyond measure. You can get a lot done in a short meeting when it’s clear that you’ve killed\nyourself to be there; but it’s overwhelmingly psychological. The power of making an “insane\neffort” almost always breaks a logjam—and not infrequently leads to a solution on the spot.\nThe key word here is … “insane.”\nLEADERSHIP</p>\n<ol start=\"53\">\n<li>To Lead Is to Help Others Succeed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“The role of the director is to create a space where the actors and actresses can become more\nthan they’ve ever been before, more than they’ve dreamed of being.”—Robert Altman, Oscar\nacceptance speech\n“No matter what the situation, the great manager’s first response is always to think about the\nindividual concerned and how things can be arranged to help that individual experience\nsuccess.”—Marcus Buckingham, The One Thing You Need to Know\nThe “business” of leaders at all levels is to help those in their charge develop beyond their\ndreams—which in turn almost automatically leads to “all that other stuff,” such as happy\ncustomers, happy stockholders, happy communities.\nTo start the ball rolling, change every performance review into a two-part process, the first in\nwhich there is a rigorous evaluation of the employee—and the second of which is a rigorous\nreview of your own efforts to help that employee forward.\n54. At Their Service. Leadership is a “service business.” Robert Greenleaf gave us the concept\nof “servant leadership”—it’s one of those “pretty much all you need to know” ideas. My take:\n(1) Organizations exist to serve. Period.\n(2) Leaders exist to serve their people. Period.\n(3) A team well-served by its leader will be inclined to pursue Excellence.\n21\nUse the word “Serve.” (That’s what you do.)\nUse the word “Service.” (That’s what you provide.)\nUse the word “Servant.” (That’s what you are.)\nThe unadorned word “service” is beauty encapsulated.\n55. Have You “Hosted” Any Good Employees Lately? Consider the leader’s primary job to\nbe a host to her or his employees. That’s the way Jan Gunnarsson and Olle Blohm put it in\nHostmanship: The Art of Making People Feel Welcome.\nGunnarsson and Blohm based this universal (as they—and I—see it) idea on their experience\nowning/running a hotel. Here’s the core idea:\n“We went through the hotel and made a … ‘consideration renovation.’ Instead of redoing\nbathrooms, dining rooms, and guest rooms, we gave employees new uniforms, bought flowers and\nfruit, and changed colors. Our focus was totally on the staff. They were the ones we wanted to\nmake happy. We wanted them to wake up every morning excited about a new day at work.”\n“The path to a hostmanship culture paradoxically does not go through the guest. In fact it\nwouldn’t be totally wrong to say that the guest has nothing to do with it. True hostmanship\nleaders focus on their employees. What drives exceptionalism is finding the right people and\ngetting them to love their work and see it as a passion. … The guest comes into the picture only\nwhen you are ready to ask, ‘Would you prefer to stay at a hotel where the staff love their work or\nwhere management has made customers its highest priority?‘”\nYour call, but I’d call it “putting first things first”—and it applies as much in the 7-person\npurchasing department as in the retail establishment.\n56. A Sacred Trust. As I see it, anyone who takes on any leadership job, minor or major,\nassumes no less than a … Sacred Trust. I know that’s extreme language. But I stand by it. This\nsacred trust is all about what organizations are all about: the professional (and, to some extent,\npersonal) development of people. Sure, the boss’s job is to “get the job done,” and done\neffectively. But “boss-hood” primarily entails an abiding responsibility for the people under your\ncharge. (It’s circular, of course: Turned-on people do turned-on work. Q.E.D.)\nConsider this as the translation of “sacred trust” into a plank in your core-values statement: “We\nare committed to the measurable growth of each and every member of our staff. We aspire to\nhave every staff member say, of their stay here, ‘That was a remarkable period of my\ndevelopment.‘”\n57. Rat Psych Rules! Or: Deploying Positive Reinforcement’s Incredible Potency. You can\noverdo anything—including positive reinforcement. It’s just that in 9 out of 10 cases (more like\n99 in 100) we “underdo” positive reinforcement—and usually overdo negative reinforcement. I,\nlike Mark Twain, “can live for months on a compliment” or a small act of encouragement. This is\none powerful tool!\nConsider the following, drawn from the recent book Barack, Inc.: Winning Business Lessons from\nthe Obama Campaign, by Rick Faulk and Barry Libert:\n22\n“[Retired United States Navy] Captain Mike Abrashoff knows the importance of saying ‘thank\nyou.’ In his first book, It’s Your Ship, he relates how he sent letters to the parents of his crew\nmembers on the guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold … Putting himself in those parents’ shoes,\nhe imagined how happy they would be to hear from the Commanding Officer that their sons and\ndaughters were doing well. And he figured that those parents would, in turn, call their children to\ntell them how proud they were of them.\n“Abrashoff debated whether to send a letter to the parents of one young man who wasn’t really\nstar material. Weighing the sailor’s progress, he decided to go ahead. A couple of weeks later, the\nsailor appeared at his door, tears streaming down his face. It seems the kid’s father had always\nconsidered him a failure and told him so. After reading the captain’s letter, he called to\ncongratulate his son and tell him how proud he was of him. ‘Captain, I can’t thank you enough,’\nsaid the young man. For the first time in his life, he felt loved and encouraged by his father.”\nWORDS\n58. “What Do You Think?” Our colleague Dave Wheeler said, in a Comment at\ntompeters.com: “The four most important words in management are … ‘What do you think?‘” I\nagree! And the old engineer in me screams: Quantify! So: How many times today did you “use\nthe four words”? I.e., exactly how many times did you utter: “What do you think?”\nMaybe go so far as to put this idea in the formal “values statement”:\n“We obsessively ask ‘What do you think?’—We understand that we rise or fall on the engagement\nand intelligence and constant contributions of 100% of us.”\n59. “Thank You”\n“The deepest human need is the need to be appreciated.”—William James, premier American\npsychologist\n“You shouldn’t be looking for people slipping up, you should be looking for all the good things\npeople do and praising those.”—Richard Branson\nThere’s no overestimating the power of appreciation—and yet its application is usually stingy at\nbest. Hence, as in so many of these “discussions of the obvious,” this is a genuine skill to be\npracticed, mastered and applied. And, again, please think about it, perhaps “Thank you” ought to\ngain a place of honor in the values statement: “We habitually express appreciation for one\nanother’s efforts—because we do in fact consciously appreciate everyone’s ‘ordinary’ ‘daily’\ncontributions, let alone the extraordinary ones.” Or words to that effect …</p>\n<ol start=\"60\">\n<li>“I’m Sorry.”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Message: THIS IS A BIG DEAL. THIS IS “STRATEGIC.”\n“I regard apologizing as the most magical, healing, restorative gesture human beings can make.\nIt is the centerpiece of my work with executives who want to get better.”—Marshall Goldsmith,\nWhat Got You Here Won’t Get You There: How Successful People Become Even More Successful\n(Goldsmith is perhaps the world’s most prominent executive coach.)\n23\nRepeat: “centerpiece of my work with executives who want to get better.”\nLike Goldsmith, I believe that a genuine apology (and there’s a lot to write, which space here does\nnot permit, about “genuine”) is of the utmost personal and strategic importance—and, indeed,\nworthy of using the label “magical.”\nAs I have become convinced of the power (personal, professional, magical) of apology, I have\nactually accumulated a small library of books on the topic—yes, there is such a library available\non apology per se. One is left with an encompassing sense of the extraordinary power of the …\nArt of Apology … rightfully considered. I believe we are talking about, in practical business\nterms, a … “matchless strategic lever.” In the arsenal of what really matters when it comes to\ngetting things done/execution/ implementation, there are few—if any—“power tools” that have\nthe heft of:\n“I apologize.”\n“I’m sorry.”\n“I’m to blame.”\n“Simply put, I screwed up.”\n“I bear full responsibility for this f***-up.”\n“I blew it. Period.”\nBonus: Often as not, an Effective Apology is far more than a “bullet dodged.” That is, not only is\na problem cleared up, but also the cock-up brilliantly and overwhelmingly and unequivocally\natoned for solidifies a relationship—and carries it forward.\n61. Words of Truth—from a Fiction Writer\n“Why not just tell the truth?”—Raymond Carver, premier American short-story writer\nNETWORKING\n62. One Line of Code: The Shortest Distance Between “Critic” and “Champion”\n“They” say that complex software implementations fall short of promised effectiveness almost all\nthe time. “They” add that the problem is rarely the software; it’s almost always less-thanenthusiastic down-the-line users.\nI have the answer (which an Aussie CIO gave me): One line of code!\nYou’re in IT.\nThe software you’ve got on offer will change the world!\nBut implementation will take place far from home. What’s the success secret? If you’re wise, it’s\nsales; you hit the road and … sell sell sell … would-be users … retail … one at a time. You sit\ndown with, say, Erik H. in marketing. He listens to your pitch, agrees on the importance of the\nproject—but—has a host of concerns. You listen, you go home; and, in effect, you alter … one\nline of code … which deals with … one … of Erik’s issues.\nBingo!\n24\nNine out of 10 of Erik’s issues are still not addressed …but … you changed … SOMETHING …\nDIRECTLY … BECAUSE OF ERIK!\nIn 4.2 out of 5 cases, Erik flips from thorn in your side to fellow champion! Suddenly the whole\ndamn thing is “Erik’s project”! In Erik’s mind, the whole thing would have collapsed without his\nprecious, save-your-ass input!\n63. “Suck Down” for Success. Forget “sucking up”—it’s a low-odds strategy. If you are\nwilling to invest the time, and it takes time, “sucking down” is a high-odds affair—to paraphrase\nthe immortal robber Willy Sutton on why he chose to knock off banks, “It’s where the money is.”\n(Oh is it ever!) In addition to the plain fact that “down there” is where the real work is done,\nindirectly, where the deal is effectively done, the folks a couple of levels “down” [“down” always\nin quotes—“‘down’ is the real ‘up’” is the anthem here] are typically bowled over by your time and\nattention—we all crave being taken seriously. Hence, the next thing you know (after a lot of\nwork) you’ve got a network to die for in the bowels of the customer organization working for\nyou—and it’s a network, typically, with staying power; there’s not so much volatility “down\nthere.”\nAs always, the point is not “catch as catch can” or “a good idea.” It’s about a well thought-out\nscheme, in fact, no less than a “way of life”—a measured, systematic effort to penetrate the ranks\nof a client organization and develop a set of relationships with the real deal makers! (Hint: As in\nso many implementation issues, women are instinctively better at this than men.)\n(NB: Alternate formulation to “Suck down for success”: “Success does not depend on ‘the people\nyou know in high places’—it depends on ‘the people you know in low places.’“)\n64. Formula for Success: C(I) > C(E). I’ve long argued that the set of relationships inside\nyour own company is almost as important as the relationships with external bill-paying\ncustomers. While it may not be a universal truth, it struck me as I talked to a GE group that sold\nbig international projects that in many cases our Internal Customers/“C(I)” are in more important\nthan our External Customers/“C(E).” That is: C(I) > C(E)\nIn the GE case, to win with External Customers the systems salespeople typically want an “unfair\nshare” (the words of one GE informant) of a host of insiders’ time—engineers, the logistics team,\nlawyers and the all-important (“yes” or “no”) risk-assessment staff.\nBottom line: What … PRECISELY (measure it!!) … have you done lately (LAST 36 HOURS!)\nfor your all-important “portfolio” of … INTERNAL CUSTOMERS? I.e.: Do Not Let A Single\nDay Pass Without Doing Something Notable For Some Internal Customer.\n65. How Does Your “Inside Game” Measure Up?\nGiven: Cross-functional communication is such a universal problem that it could fairly be called\nenterprise “Problem #1.”\nSolution (one more part thereof): All staff departments ought to/should/must quickly install firstrate internal customer satisfaction measurement systems—with tough up and down incentives. In\nmy experience, it is the rare staff department that measures (internal) customer satisfaction\nreligiously—and the ever more rare internal unit that ties substantial rewards and penalties to\nsuch measurements. That must change!\n25\nCase: I met the boss of Staff Services at a large Italian bank. He was fanatic about “customer”\nsatisfaction for his departments’ internal customers. In his scheme, each staff department’s\ninternal “customers” themselves devised the measures; and the primary dollars and cents (Euro)\nincentives for staff departments were based primarily on quantitative measures of their internal\ncustomers’ satisfaction—the staff department exec called this Internal Customer Satisfaction\nSystem “my principal strategic initiative.”\nLUNCH\n66. Across the Board: Cross-Functional Collaboration Is Issue #1—in a 6-person logistics\nsub-department, a 12-table restaurant, an auto dealership. Therefore going after this issue daily is\na Monster Opportunity. Want great cross-functional cooperation-opportunity maximization, or\nXFX/Cross-functional Excellence?\nAnswer: Make friends in other functions! (Purposefully.)\nAnswer: Go to lunch with people in other functions!! Frequently!!\nAnswer: Ask peers in other functions for some references so you can become conversant in their\nworld. (Big deal: You’ll find it interesting—and it’s a helluva sign of … GIVE-A-DAMN-ism.)\nAnswer: Invite counterparts in other functions to your meetings. Religiously. Ask them to present\n“cool stuff” from “their world” to your group. (B-I-G deal; useful and respectful.)\nAnswer: Present counterparts in other functions awards for service to your group—hold an “AllStar Supporters [from other groups] Banquet.”\nAnswer: When someone in another function asks for assistance, respond with even more alacrity\nthan you would if it were the person in the cubicle next to yours—or more than you would for a\nkey external customer.\nAnswer: Do not bad mouth … “the damned accountants,” “the damned HR guy.” Ever.\nAnswer: Twenty more things like this that boil down to establishing and maintaining and\nenhancing social-human bonds with “the ‘thems,’” as I label it.\n67. Getting Along and Going to Lunch: Solving the Cross-Functional Cooperation Problem\nThere’s a lot more to say about cross-functional integration, but I want this one to stand by itself.\nDo lunch!\nConsider each workday lunch an “at bat.” Four workweeks at five days each adds up to about 20\n“at bats” each month.\n20 opportunities to start New Relationships;\n20 opportunities to nurture or extend Old Relationships;\n20 opportunities to patch up Frayed Relationships;\n20 opportunities to “Take a Freak to Lunch”—and learn something new;\n20 opportunities to test an idea with a potential Recruit-Alliance Partner;\n20 opportunities to get to know someone in Another Function;\n20 opportunities to … PURSUE or MAKE A SALE … to gain a Convert-Champion for your idea\nor project.\nEach lunch gone is gone for good. 20 per month. 240 per year. To a Major League Baseball\nPlayer, EACH AT BAT is Precious. To a “determined-to-build-a-matchless-network-and-collectcool-outsiders-and-useful-allies” … EACH LUNCH is Precious.\n26\nSPECIAL SECTION: “THE EQUATIONS”: An Engineer’s View of the … Secrets of\nEffective Implementation\nEngineers live for mathematical and/or algebraic representation of any and all things.

She said “No.” I’ve known her for a long time. If she’s anything, she’s self\ncertain. I.e., “No” = No.\nWhen we arrived in town from Vermont, we were therefore nonplussed to find a message from\nJoan, saying, “I’ll be arriving at 7.” We obviously asked her why she’d changed her mind.\n“I decided to say ‘Yes.‘” She recalled a friend who’d had a vigorous life into her 90s. “She said she\nhad three ‘secrets’: First, surround yourself with good books on any and every topic. Second,\n27\nspend time with people of all ages. And third, say ‘Yes.‘” She added that indeed she had not\nintended to drive down from Connecticut. But she remembered her friend and determinedly\ndecided to say …\n“Yes.”\n69. For the Sheer Glorious 24/7 Fun of It! Richard Branson’s idea of fun is going head to\nhead in the ring with someone who has him by a jillion pounds. As Michael Specter wrote in his\nwonderful New Yorker profile (“Branson’s Luck”), “Branson likes to enter a market controlled by\na giant … British Airways, say, or Coke or Murdoch. Then he presents himself as the hip\nalternative.” Branson is his brand, he enjoys nutty stunts that personify the brand’s “hipness.”\nI’m not Branson by a long, long shot; but I understand the guiding impulse. The only reason that I\ntake on new stuff, and keep accumulating frequent flyer miles, has long been the unadulterated\npleasure I get from always marching “the other way”—and in particular storming after those I\nthink have let us down—from numbers-obsessed execs to the healthcare industry’s lack of rigor\nas measured by hundreds of thousands of preventable annual deaths in the U.S. alone.\nMy advice?\nThis is strategic: As boss, do your darnedest to “make it fun,” “make it a ride to remember,”\n“make it a bloody ball”! Though you don’t need to do round-the-world balloon escapades like\nBranson, your Job #1, or at least Job #2, is to in fact … “make it fun/cool.”\nNO\n70. “To Don’ts” Are More Important Than “To-Dos” My friend Dennis is a prominent\neducator. A few years ago he received a huge $$$ grant—and he was given the opportunity to roll\nout his program across the country. Suddenly, he was required to turn his innovative ideas into a\nsystem that could be replicated by “ordinary people.” Dennis is “one of those people” who has 10\nideas a minute—moreover, all 10 are usually good ideas. And so his talented staff ran around\nmadly working on exciting this or exciting that. But now he had that “low variation” system to\nrun—and things promised to be different. I attended a meeting of his advisory Committee at a\ncritical moment. The Chairman had been CEO of an enormous firm. I will always remember a\nsingle line that emerged from the fellow’s mouth:\n“Dennis, you need a ‘to-don’t’ list.”\nIn simple language: What you decide not to do is probably more important that what you decide\nto do. (A lot of smart-wise people agree on this, super-coach Marshall Goldsmith, the gold\nstandard, among them.) But you probably can’t work on “to-don’t” alone—you need a sounding\nboard/mentor/advisor/nag you trust to act as a Drill Sergeant who will frog-march you to the\nwoodshed when you stray and start doing those time-draining “to don’ts.” (Said advisor could be\nspouse, professional coach, other, need not be expert in your world, and must be totally trusted.)\n71. Some Things Worth Doing Are Worth Doing Not Particularly Well. The reminder\ncame one night as I was doing dishes. I was dealing with a particularly resistant old baking pan. I\ncleaned up the food residue—it was fully sanitary. But there was some crusty crap left, which I\nwent after with a vengeance—but somewhat unsuccessfully. At one point I started laughing at\n28\nmyself. The pan was sanitary and “clean enough,” plus I really didn’t need to treat the effort like a\nspeech to Fortune 50 CEOs.\nThe micro-event (I did stop) reminded me of the Greater Truth. In a world (personal,\nprofessional) of limited resources (time, in this instance, time in most instances) and priorities of\nthe utmost importance (to you and me at any rate), there’s a lot of “stuff” that must be done—but\nfor which “good enough” is in fact good enough. For some of us making the distinction is easier\nsaid than done—and the cost for not figuring out the difference is high.</p>\n<p>CUSTOMERS\n72. It’s 11 A.M.—Have You Called a Customer Today?\nStop.\nNow.\nCall a Customer.\nOut of the Blue.\n“How can I help?”\n“Have we delivered on every promise, implicit as well as explicit?”\nListen and take copious notes.\nFollow-up instantly on at least one “little” thing.\nRepeat. 48-hours hence.\nHint: This applies to 100% of us.\n73. There’s Nothing But Nothing Cooler Than an Angry Customer!\n“The problem is almost never the problem. The problem is invariably the response to the\nproblem.”—anon.\nBizarre but true: Our most loyal customers are ones who had a problem with us … and then\nmarveled when we went the Extra Ten Miles at the Speed of Light to fix it!\nBusiness opportunity No.1* = Irate customers converted into fans. (*Yes, No.1.)\nSo … are you on the active prowl for customer problems to fix? Rules:\nMake “over”-reacting to problems a keystone in the corporate culture, a plank in the Corporate\nValues statement. (“We respond to customers with passion and rapidity and resources in ways\nthat stun-amaze-overwhelm those customers 100.00% of the time.“)\nReward (BIG TIME.) those who unearth … and report … customer problems.\n“Over”-connect: let the customer know ASAP (!!), and update constantly—even if there is\nabsolutely nothing to report.\n29\nEnsure that there are devoted resources at the ready to respond to problems. (No matter how good\nyour systems, there will be problems—be staffed adequately, and then some, to respond at\nlightening speed.)\nRepeat: Business opportunity No.1 = Irate customers converted into outspoken fans.\n74. What We Have Here Is a Failure to Over-Communicate. I was flying home from Mexico\nCity to Boston, on Delta, via Atlanta. The ATL-BOS leg was delayed about 75 minutes: Never\nonce did waiting area personnel or the pilot provide any explanation whatsoever. I do not\nexaggerate. Not one bloody, frigging word.\nNo, this is not really news in “airline service sucks significantly land.” Nonetheless, it serves as a\nnot-quite-friendly alarm bell to all of us in any and every circumstance, signaling the … Insanely\nImportant Value of Keeping People Informed/Over-informed 100.00% of the Time.\nWe can almost all deal quite well with shit—we all/almost all deal very poorly with uncertainty.\nTell me it’ll probably be a 90-minute delay because the pilot is in the bar popping Tequila shots—\nand I’m fine. (More or less.) Total Silence? I’m on edge, pissed off as hell.\n(Play back the last 24 or 48 hours. Is there an instance where you have failed to Fully Inform a\nClient, or other stakeholder, of a delay, wee or grand, or glitch? If your answer is “nope, all is\nwell”—you are a dunce.)\n75. Be “Entwined” with Your Client Came across, stuck in a book, the torn-out cover story\nfrom Time, 25 October 2004, “The God Gene.” There was a quiz therein, “How Spiritual Are\nYou?” I imagined, as a not particularly “religious person,” I’d be in the lower quartile. But to my\nsurprise, I scored 15/20—“highly spiritual, a real mystic.”\nHere’s Question #1, to which I instantly answered “Yes”: “I often feel so connected to the people\naround me that it is as if there is no separation between us.”\nOf course!\nThat’s what my “speaking career” is all about!!\nThat’s how I make a difference!!\nNo-Zero-Nada-Zip degrees of separation!!\nSo: Are you “one with your clients”—effectively “spiritually” entwined with those clients? Do\nyou truly “get them”?\nRichard Branson does.\nBill Marriott does.\nSam Walton did.\nAnita Roddick did.\nLee Iacocca does/did.\n(Would you buy a car from this man?)\nRick Wagoner—former GM boss—did not.\n(Would you buy a car from this man?)\n30\nACTION</p>\n<ol start=\"76\">\n<li>“Trying My Damnedest!” Wrong Answer! Long story, but as a junior officer (U.S.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Navy) in Vietnam, I once answered a general with, in part, “I’m doing my best.” He erupted, a\ntrue Vesuvius. It is not enough, he said with an icy stare, to do one’s best [in taking care of my\nsailors], I must do it, period. [A parallel Churchill quote goes like this: “It is not enough to do\nyour best—you must succeed in doing what is necessary.“] All I can say, 43 years later, is that the\nlesson took.\nConsider: “A man approached J.P. Morgan, held up an envelope, and said, ‘Sir, in my hand I hold\na guaranteed formula for success, which I will gladly sell you for $25,000.’\n‘Sir,’ J.P. Morgan replied, ‘I do not know what is in the envelope; however, if you show it to me,\nand I like it, I give you my word a as gentleman that I will pay you what you ask.’ The man\nagreed to the terms, and handed over the envelope. J.P. Morgan opened it, and extracted a single\nsheet of paper. He gave it one look, a mere glance, then handed the piece of paper back to the\ngent. And paid him the agreed-upon $25,000. The contents of the note:\n“1. Every morning, write a list of the things that need to be done that day.\n“2. Do them.”\n77. Captain “Day” and Captain “Night”: A Tale of Two Deployments and Two\nSuggestions. As a combat engineer (Seabee) in Vietnam, I made two deployments and had two\ncommanding officers, or COs. To this day, I call them “day” and “night.” My first CO, Dick\nAnderson (CAPTAIN Anderson!), was “day.” Our job was to build stuff—roads, bridges, camps,\ngun emplacements, etc.—mostly for the U.S. Marine Corps. Captain Andy’s approach could be\nsummarized in three words, subsequently made immortal by Nike; namely, “Just do it.” Above\nall, Captain Andy wanted no damned excuses. The upshot was that we got a lot of work done, and\ndone well, in short order.\nDeployment #2 brought Captain “Night,” whose name shall not be mentioned. He had a different\nstyle of “leadership” entirely. It’s often called “by the book.” He was a stickler for the formalities.\nI sometimes thought and think that he was more interested in typo-free reports of jobs not yet\ndone than hell-and-high-water-completed construction. I had a crappy time, as did pretty much\nthe whole set of junior officers; and our track record in getting things done for our customers was\nless than sterling.\nBetween the two, I had pretty much all I needed for a successful management career. When faced\nwith a thorny issue, I try to follow Captain Andy’s rules—and avoid the approach of Capt. Night\nat all costs.\n78. If You Want To Find Oil, You Must Drill Wells. Right after publishing In Search of\nExcellence, I received a nice note in the mail accompanied by an inscribed book: The Hunters by\nJohn Masters, a successful Canadian Oil &#x26; Gas wildcatter. Here is the excerpt I underlined 25\nyears ago, and have battered seminar participants with ever since:\n“This is so simple it sounds stupid, but it is amazing how few oil people really understand that\nyou only find oil if you drill wells. You may think you’re finding it when you’re drawing maps and\nstudying logs, but you have to drill.”\n31\nMessage: YOU HAVE TO DRILL!\nI sometimes, and not in jest, call “it” “the only thing I’ve learned ‘for sure’ in the last 44 years.”\nNamely, She or he who tries the most stuff … wins! Naturally I’ve collected a ton of supporting\nquotes to support my bias for a “bias for action.” A few of my favorites:\n“We have a strategic plan. It’s called doing things.” —Herb Kelleher, founder, Southwest\nAirlines\n“READY. FIRE. AIM.”—Ross Perot (and others)\n“Blame no one.\n“Expect nothing.\n“Do something.”\n—Locker room sign posted by football coach Bill Parcells\n“You miss 100 percent of the shots you never take.”—Wayne Gretzky\nCHANGE</p>\n<ol start=\"79\">\n<li>Zen and the Art of Achieving Change Where It Already Exists.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“Some people look for things that went wrong and try to fix them. I look for things\nthat went right and try to build on them.”—Bob Stone/Mr. ReGo/VP Al Gore’s point\nman for “reinventing government”\n“Somewhere in your organization, groups of people are already doing things differently and\nbetter. To create lasting change, find these areas of positive deviance and fan the flames.”—\nRichard Tanner Pascale &#x26; Jerry Sternin, “Your Company’s Secret Change Agents,” Harvard\nBusiness Review\nBob Stone was a Zen master, a Sumo wrestler—a Master of Indirection. He knew he could not\nforce change on the Federal bureaucracy; even the President rarely succeeds by frontal assault.\nBut he also knew there were astonishingly effective, renegade Civil Servants at work in the\nunderbelly of the system—plying their effective-but-scorned trade as far from the light as\npossible. The trick was to discover their existence and induce them to “come out” and serve as\nvisible role models/“benchmarks” to their more timid peers.\nMessage:\n(1) Comb the underground for “troublemakers” who are creating and living tomorrow\ntoday.\n(2) Anoint them as Public Paragons of the New Deal-to-Be.\n(3) Encourage others to visit them and observe palpable models of new ways of doing\nbusiness.\n(4) Applaud the Nouveau Copycats of the First Round Pioneers—and grow the Renegade\nBrigade as rapidly as possible.\n32\n80. The Way of the Demo. Change in “big” places is mostly a result of showing off “demos”\nfrom modest-sized “cool” places! (This happens also to be true with individual change.) You’ve\ngot a great new software solution to a purchasing conundrum. You need a test bed. At a meeting,\nyou get into a private discussion with the on-the-make General Manager of a small division of\nBigCo in Ireland; she thinks your new software is off-the-charts good, and is keen to get a jump\non others by becoming an early adopter. Once she’s done her bit, you can say to the slugabed bigdivision General Managers, “Why don’t you go and look at what the Irish have done with this—it\nchanged their world.”\nTo succeed with “new stuff,” you must find … Kindred Spirits … those who will … Play with You\n(and your “cool stuff”) … which in turn provides you with … “Demos” … that you can Tout Far &#x26;\nWide.\nI call “it”: THE WAY OF THE DEMO. And I will boldly state: Selling-by-demo is the singlebest way to accelerate acceptance of a novel (=scary) idea.\nNO DEMO.\nNO DEAL.\nPERIOD.\n(I used the example of internal sales—precisely the same approach works wonders in external\nsales. Message: Do not, except in rare circumstances start by making presentations to “the big\nguys.“)\n81. Big Change—All at Once! I am an avowed incrementalist—even if the eventual aim is\nstratospherically high. That is, get going ASAP—and quickly experiment your way toward/to\nsuccess. But when my wife and I had a Grand Idea in 2008 for a landscaping project that would\nchange the look and feel of our Farm in Tinmouth VT, we decided, more or less, to … do it all at\nonce. There has been pain from biting off more than we could readily chew, but the story to this\npoint has the mark of a real success far beyond our initial imaginings.\nThe power of “getting going on everything at once” with but a sliver of a master plan (a couple of\n“napkin” sketches) was that we could envision from the outset the vague outline of what was\ngoing to (more or less) end up happening—thence we could adjust like crazy, improvise\nconstantly, destroy and create using the entire palette, and dramatically reshape the overall\nwork, and even the overall concept, as we went along. Which, of course, means we didn’t really\nreject my beloved Rapid Experimentation Method—we just did it on and amidst a Grand Platform\ncalled “everything is in motion and up for grabs.”\nI’m not sure I’d do things, big things, this way in every instance, but I do think there are times\nwhen such an “all at once” approach is merited—when you have a Big Idea but need to be living\n“in the middle of it,” with all ends loose ends, to figure out what it means.\n82. Big Change—in a Short Time. The story goes that General George Patton turned around a\nbedraggled U.S. Army in North Africa in a matter of a few weeks upon taking charge in 1943.\n(Some say a few days.) Upon taking over a new command, Admiral Lord Nelson would change\nthe attitude of an entire fleet in … less than a week. The CEO of a giant transportation company\ncompletely upended line officers’ responsibility and authority and accountability (increased by an\norder of magnitude) almost “overnight”—literally everyone, including a couple of “hopeless\nbureaucrats,” bitched and moaned and rose to the occasion—performance spurted more or less\ninstantly, and then kept going.\n33\nSeveral expert analysts argue from extensive anecdotal evidence that “big change” is actually\n“easier” than small change. Mostly because it’s far easier to get people excited about a Big Hairy\nAudacious Goal (Jim Collins’s felicitous term) than “incremental improvement:” also big, quick\nchange cuts off escape routes.\nMy “bottom line” after lots of thought and observation: Change will take precisely as long as you\nthink it will. The “arrogance of absurdly high expectations” can pay off in very short order if\nyou’ve got the nerve to go for it and the deep-rooted (messianic) belief that … “There’s utterly no\nreason why we can’t do this in a month!”\n83. Clever? Never!\n“The art of war does not require complicated maneuvers; the simplest are the best, and common\nsense is fundamental. From which one might wonder how it is generals make blunders; it is\nbecause they try to be clever.”—Napoleon\nI make every effort to read new business strategy books and articles. In 90 percent of cases, I can\ndismiss neither the author’s thought process nor his or her evidence—but I am always taken aback\nby the abundance of “clever” and the absence of any discussion or consideration of the ability to\nimplement the suggestions made or implied. There is total silence around the subject. For\nexample, I did a quick analysis of the Index of one “famous” strategy tome circa 2007—words\nlike “people” and “customer” and “leadership” and “implementation” and “execution” were\nliterally missing.\n(NB: I gave some thought to not including any commentary in #83, just letting Napoleon’s quote\nstand alone on the page. I dearly do not want to dilute in any way the power and clarity and\nsimplicity of his words.)\nSPECIAL SECTION: You, Me, and Charlie Wilson’s War\nGeorge Crile’s Charlie Wilson’s War, the tale of the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan\n(which led directly to its subsequent unraveling), is quite simply the most extraordinary nonfiction potboiler I have ever read. And, perhaps surprisingly, it has lessons for you and me from\nCongressman Wilson and his CIA cohort, Gust Avrakotos:\n(1) Make friends with the … “Invisible 95%.” Gust Avrakotos apparently knew every “top floor”\nCIA executive secretary by name—and had helped many of them sort out personal or\nprofessional problems. The folks in the mailroom and in the bowels of the computer operations\naffairs were also the subject of Gust’s intense and affectionate attentions. In effect, you could say\nthat Gust was Commander-in-Chief of the “Invisible 95%” of the Agency—which allowed him to\nmake extraordinary things happen despite furious resistance from his bosses and bosses’ bosses\nsitting atop a very rigid organization.\n34\n(2) Create a Networker-Doer Partnership. Congressman Wilson had the networking part down,\nbut he needed help with the doing. Conversely, if you are the doer, then you must find the\npolitician-networker.\n(3) Carefully manage the BOF/Balance Of Favors. Practice potlatch—giving so much help to so\nmany people on so many occasions (purposeful overkill!) that there is little issue about their\nsupporting you when the (rare!) time comes to call in the chits.\n(4) Follow the money! “Anybody with a brain can figure out that if they can get on the Defense\nsubcommittee, that’s where they ought to be—because that’s where the money is.”—Charlie\nWilson\n(5) Found material. (And found people.) Don’t reinvent the wheel. It costs too much, takes too\nmuch time, requires too much bureaucratic hassle, and is too hard to implement—you’ve got\nenough problems already.\n(6) The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Hold your nose—and get the job done with some\nthorns in your side at your side.\n(7) Real, Visible Passion! Create graphic evidence of the source of your passion. Wilson’s passion\nabout his beliefs were visibly magnified by tactics he shamelessly employed to make it\npersonal—and to make sure that others knew it was personal. For example, on every visit to the\nrefugee camps, Wilson donated blood on the spot.\n(8) Passion as Deterrence. Passion suggests exhausting “staying power”—“I might as well not\nwaste energy or chits blocking him, he’s not going away and he’ll hound me and absorb my time\ntill hell freezes over.”\n(9) Cut red tape. “What we did in one month with Charlie would have taken us nine years to\naccomplish.”—Gust Avrakotos\n(10) Create a small, insanely committed “band of brothers-sisters” to act as mostly invisible\norchestrators.\n(11) Keep the Long Haul in Mind, Too. Passion for today’s action is paramount—but always,\nalways, always think consciously about … Network Investment for the future.\n(12) The Game Ain’t Over Until the Fat Lady Sings. “They” (lots of “theys”) call it the Law of\nUnintended Consequences. In this instance, after the Russians had withdrawn from Afghanistan,\nthe U.S. once again returned to benign neglect of the region—the result was, indirectly, 9/11,\norchestrated from Afghanistan by some of the people we had supported a decade earlier.\nIn Honor of Charlie and Gust and Their Ilk:\n“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to\nadapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” —G.B.\nShaw, Man and Superman: The Revolutionist’s Handbook\n“Whenever anything is being accomplished, it is being done, I have learned, by a monomaniac\nwith a mission.”—Peter Drucker\n35\nPASSION</p>\n<ol start=\"84\">\n<li>I Second That Emotion! Ever heard of a success story featuring a</li>\n</ol>\n<p>… dispassionate symphony conductor?\n… bored painter?\n… apathetic self-made billionaire?\n… 9 to 5 entrepreneur?\n“Great leaders move us. They ignite our passion and inspire the best in us. When we try to\nexplain why they are so effective, we speak of strategy, vision or powerful ideas. But the reality is\nmuch more primal: Great leadership works through the emotions.”—Daniel Goleman, The New\nLeaders\nAcknowledge emotion.\nHire for emotion.\nEvaluate for emotion.\nPromote for emotion.\nLead by emotion.\n(Follow by emotion.)\n“Sell” emotion.\n85. One Rule! Much Gold! Enterprise, public or private, small or enormous, is all about\nhumanity—about humans serving humans, about human growth and community. That’s obvious,\nor should be. But it’s always worth a reminder—far more than usual as we reflect on the\nthoughtless shenanigans that delivered to us the worst financial crisis in 75 years.\nThinking deeply about these fundamentals reminded me of my old friend, the late John\nMcConnell, founder of Worthington Steel. A pragmatist to a fault, as befits an Ohioan born and\nbred, John believed that growth and profitability flowed from fairness and trust. In fact, he went\nfurther, and insisted that the Golden Rule makes for a complete “policy manual”!\nAs far as I’m concerned, he was on to something, and Worthington’s continuing success in very\ntough times in a very tough industry is testimony to the validity of McConnell’s “simple” beliefs,\nlived for decades with a passion by a cast of thousands.\nThe icing on the cake and the irrefutable challenge, courtesy Dr. Frank Crane: “The Golden Rule\nis of no use to you whatsoever unless you realize that it is your move.”\n86. Seize the Moments. Business (“life,” too, of course) rises or falls on the nature and\ncharacter and lingering memory of what the legendary airline (SAS) boss, Jan Carlzon, called\n“moments of truth”—those fleeting fragments of true human contact that quite literally define our\nenterprise’s Spirit &#x26; Excellence—or lack thereof.\nThus our goal, perhaps our primary goal, in every flavor and every size of business, is to\n“MTMMOT”—Manage To Memorable Moments Of Truth. Every decision—about hiring, firing,\nsupervision, training, systems development, lobby décor, etc.—should be designed for and\nbrought immediately and directly to bear on the “production” of Memorable Moments of Truth.\nPerhaps we need a … Manager of Memorable Moments of Truth? (Seriously!)\n36\nPRESENCE\n87. Managing by Wandering Around—It’s All Around You! Back in 1982, as my In Search\nof Excellence coauthor Bob Waterman and I were preparing in our Manhattan hotel room for our\nbrief appearance on the Today show to talk about “the book,” we got into a tussle. Turns out we\nboth most loved the same thing in Search—and both wanted to utter the word/words on national\nTV. We flipped a coin, Bob won—and I’m still frustrated almost three decades later! The\nbragging rights at stake?\nMBWA or “Managing By Wandering Around,” a concept we learned about from what was, in\n1979 when we began our research, a much smaller, more intimate Hewlett-Packard.\nFor me, MBWA has become a metaphor for the manager’s/leader’s #1 priority: Staying in touch.\nI am a MBWA zealot.\nI swear by MBWA.\nIn any and all circumstances.\nIt is indeed leadership’s sine qua non.\n(I ran into a senior healthcare exec who’d attended a big-league leadership seminar. The\nprominent instructor asked the group, “Who is your #1 enemy?” Answers, no surprise, included\n“competitors,” “execs who play politics,” “clunky systems,” “thoughtless regulations.” “No,” the\ninstructor snapped, “it’s your desk—getting stuck behind your desk and slowly, or not-so-slowly,\nlosing touch.” Amen!)\n88. All Senses! Or Nonsense! I swear I can hear him. The successful community bank CEO.\nBut, actually, it was two decades ago. The topic, at one of my seminars, was MBWA. Or Close to\nthe Customer. No matter. I remember his translation from his world, circa, say, 1986, to what I\nhad been discussing:\n“Tom, let me give you the definition of a good lending officer. On Sunday, after church, driving\nthe family home, he takes a little detour past a distribution center he’s lent money to. Doesn’t go\nin, barely slows down, just takes a look, tidiness, external maintenance, whatever, takes it in with\nall his senses. That’s all.”\nAnd that was it.\nIn touch.\nAll senses.\nFleeting but “real.”\nHave I just explained the alpha through omega of the financial meltdown? Of course not! But we\ncould have used a few more “all-senses” “drive-bys” in the world of mortgage banking. And in a\nfew of the CDS shops, not to mention Mr. Madoff’s shop, too!\n“In touch”—literally and figuratively—matters. A lot.\n89. Leave Your Wallet (or Pocketbook) at Home. I recently forgot to take my wallet with me\non a grocery trip. It was only after I got to the grocery store—22 miles from home—that I\ndiscovered my mistake. Luckily, I had a secret cash stash in the glove compartment, just for this\n37\nsort of eventuality. Boy, did I ever decimate that (not-so-small) stash in my 5 or 6 stops around\ntown!\nSo what?\nI, undoubtedly like you, typically pay for stuff with plastic or keystrokes. There is many an\n“ouch” in the process. But the credit-card “ouch” is a far cry from peeling off $138 at the grocery\nstore, $47 to fill a … Subaru, $78 at one of my “ordinary” stops at the bookstore, and more, more,\nmore at a couple of other shops—e.g., $68 for fresh fish for four. One’s sense of the true cost of\nliving goes up by an order of magnitude. The bigger point is obvious, if elusive—more than ever,\ncompanies of all sizes have to bring reality home in some high-impact way. Not that “work as a\nclerk for a day” silliness—which is mostly a charade, albeit a well-meaning one—but something\nmore realistic.\nPay for your groceries with cash next time.\nYour car repair, too.\nThe office supply bill? Ditto.\nBy hook or by crook … drag realism in the office door.\n90. Get Down from Your Pedestal—and Beware the Sound of Laughter! In his\nautobiography, General Norman Schwarzkopf reveals, hardly central to his story but perhaps\nworth a moment, that he simply cannot tell a joke effectively. Forgets stuff. Timing off. Screws\nup the punchline. Etc. But then a funny thing happened when he got promoted to General. The\nmoment he pinned a … STAR … on his collar he apparently became hilarious—associates start\nlaughing uproariously at his jokes, botched or not.\nThe message is clear, and it’s one for all who manage, not just General Officers: Beware\nunderlings who laugh at your jokes. Writ large, as is my habit: Once you become a boss you will\nnever hear the unadulterated truth again! (Keyword: Never.) And that’s almost as true for a 20-\nyear-old shift boss in a Dunkin’ Donuts in Littlesville as for a senior middle manager or business\nowner or General S.\n91. Big Plan? No, Small Steps (Steps on the Ground) In The White Man’s Burden: Why the\nWest’s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good, nation-building expert\nWilliam Easterly laments, “The West spent $2.3 trillion on foreign aid over the last five decades\nand still has not managed to get 12-cent medicines to children to prevent half of all malaria\ndeaths. The West spent $2.3 trillion and still has not managed to get three dollars to each new\nmother to prevent five million child deaths.”\nEasterly is the arch enemy of the Big Plan (his capital letters, not mine—for once) and the fan of\npractical activities of “Searchers” (his cap “S”) who learn the ins and outs of the culture, politics,\nand local conditions “on the ground” in order to use local levers, and get those 12-cent medicines\nto community members. He writes:\n“In foreign aid, Planners announce good intentions but don’t motivate anyone to carry them out;\nSearchers find things that work and get some reward. Planners raise expectations but take no\nresponsibility for meeting them; Searchers accept responsibility for their actions; Planners\ndetermine what to supply; Searchers find out what is in demand. Planners apply global\nblueprints; Searchers adapt to local conditions. Planners at the top lack knowledge of the\nbottom; Searchers find out what the reality is at the bottom. Planners never hear whether the\n38\nplanned recipients got what they needed; Searchers find out if the customer is satisfied. … A\nPlanner thinks he already knows the answers; he thinks of poverty as a technical engineering\nproblem that his answers will solve. A Searcher admits he doesn’t know the answers in advance;\nhe believes that poverty is a complicated tangle of political, social, historical, institutional, and\ntechnological factors; he hopes to find answers to individual problems only by trial and error and\nexperimentation. A Planner believes outsiders know enough to impose solutions; a Searcher\nbelieves only insiders have enough knowledge to find solutions, and that most solutions must be\nhomegrown.”\nHerewith, a sampling of the “lessons” I’ve extracted from William Easterly:\nLesson: Show up! Stay! “Boots on the ground,” “permanently,” at the loci of implementation. (No\nlong “home leaves” if possible—“in this with you” is the message that must be sent.)\nLesson: Invest in ceaseless study of conditions “on the ground”—social and political and\nhistorical and systemic.\nLesson: Talk to the “locals.”\nLesson: Listen to the “locals.” (And listen.) (With perceived patience!) (And listen.) (And listen.)\n(And listen.) (And listen.) (And listen.) (And listen.) (With perceived patience!) (And listen.)\nLesson: Respect the “locals.”\nLesson: Empathize with the “locals.”\nAnd on it goes with 10 or 20 more in The Little BIG Things …\nLesson: To summarize the summary:\nShow up!\nListen!\nHear!\nRespect!\nEmpathize!\nSkip the Grand Theorems!\nDive in and Try and Try and Adjust and Try Again and Plagiarize from Extant Experiments …\nuntil You’re Blue in the Face!\nMove at an appropriate pace, not a headline-grabbing pace!\nHonor the local politics as your life’s blood—regardless of attendant frustration!\nGet the community’s women heavily involved. (THIS IS HUGE—AND I EMPHASIZE IT\nACCORDINGLY IN THE BOOK.)\nNB:\n“Local politics”—“the last 95%“!\nMake that “the last 98%“!\nPolitics: Love it—or go home!* ** ***\n*Hint: This applies … everywhere!\n**No “politics,” no progress!\n***Period.\nNB: Probably not many reading this book work for NGOs or other agencies delivering aid. But\n100% of us are in the full-time business of … GTD/Getting Things Done. Simply put, Easterly’s\nbook is perhaps the best tract I’ve read on the topic of implementation-getting things done. There\nis a ridiculously small library of books on implementation per se—which is a scandal.\n39\nTALENT</p>\n<ol start=\"92\">\n<li>Hiring: Do You Approach It with Unabashed Fanaticism?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“Hiring is the most important aspect of business—and yet remains woefully misunderstood.”—\nGeoff Smart and Randy Street, Who: The A Method for Hiring\n“Development can help great people become even better—but if I had a dollar to spend, I’d spend\n…70 cents … getting the right person in the door.”— Paul Russell, Director of Leadership &#x26;\nDevelopment, Google\nWe are seriously concerned with hiring, no doubt of it. But … do we treat it … strategically … as\nthe “most important aspect of business”—4-person auto body shop or Siemens? My constant\nrefrain concerning such topics: Are we … “professional students of” … hiring??? As I see it\n(again!): Effective hiring = Effective offshore motorboat racing = A craft, a profession with a\nbody of knowledge to be mastered.\n(FYI, give Geoff Smart and Randy Street’s Who: The A Method for Hiring a try.)\n93. Promotion: Are You Building a “Two Per Year” Legacy? Suppose you hold one of\nyour organization’s top jobs for five years, about average. Suppose, and this is typically about\nright, that you have two key promotion decisions per year. Then it stands to reason that just ten\ndecisions in five years determine (not “contribute to,” but “determine”) your legacy!\nOnce more, I’m hardly accusing you of being a slacker. I have … ZERO … doubt about the\nseriousness with which you attend promotion decisions. But once more I am asking: Do you give\nthe promotion decision, if you are, say, BigCo CEO, exactly the same attention you give a major\nacquisition? That’s the level of importance in terms of impact—hence it’s a pretty decent\nyardstick of “attention deserved.” Most of us, obviously, are not “CEO of BigCo,” but the idea is\nprecisely the same in any boss selection process.\nPromotion decision?\nFanaticism rules!\n94. Development: Are You Finding and Cultivating First-Rate First-Line Supervisors?\nSuccess in the marketplace is a great thing!\nTop quality products you can be proud of are great things!\nIntegrity and transparency are great things!\nBut none of the three is the principal determinant of worker satisfaction. That honor goes, hands\ndown, to … whether or not the employee gets along with/works well with his or her first-line\nsupervisor! So, for example:\n(1) Are you, Big Boss, a … f-o-r-m-a-l student of front-line supervisor behavioral excellence?*\n(*Yes, again, damn it, this sort of thing can be formally studied.)\n(2) Do you spend … gobs and gobs (and then more and more gobs and gobs) of time … selecting\nthe first-line supervisors?\n40\n(3) Do you have the … best training program in the industry (best = best) for first-line\nsupervisors?\n(4) Do you Formally &#x26; Rigorously … mentor … first-line supervisors?\n(5) Are you willing, pain notwithstanding, to … leave a first-line supervisor slot open … until you\ncan fill the slot with somebody spectacular? (And are you willing to use some word like …\n“spectacular” … in judging applicants for the job?)\nI am, again, absolutely … not … suggesting that you aren’t serious about first-line supervisor\nselection, care, and feeding. I absolutely … am … suggesting, in pretty much no uncertain terms,\nthat you probably don’t take it as seriously as you might if you saw it as precisely what it is … a\nfirst-order … strategic … decision.\nFact (unequivocal): The single most significant/#1 determinant of your outfit’s product-service\nquality and productivity is the quality of your “portfolio” of first-line supervisors.\nSummary: The last three items (#92, #93, #94) constitute HR’s “Big Three”/the “Talent Trio”:\n(1) Hiring = Most important business decisions.\n(2) Two promotion decisions per year = Legacy.\n(3) First-line supervisors = Keystone to employee morale and satisfaction and\nproductivity.\nFollowed in each instance by my “Big Two” queries:\n(1) Are you an avid student of the three issues/opportunities?\n(2) Do you spend an appropriate (that is, “insane”) amount of time on these three issuesopportunities-strategic watersheds?\nTo stretch a little further:\nHiring + Two promotions/year + First-line supervisor development = Business strategy +\nPersonal leadership effectiveness.\n95. People Who Develop People: What’s Your Track Record? In New Delhi in the spring\nof 2009, I had a senior General Officer in the Indian Army in the front row of the meeting room. I\ndon’t recall the details, but evaluating senior officers for promotion came up. I ventured, boldly,\nthat there “was … one … issue [in the promotion evaluation] that stood head and shoulders above\nthe rest.” Namely: What is this candidate’s track record—in exacting detail—in developing\npeople. Though hardly locked in concrete, I posited that “the ONE question” might go something\nlike this:\n“In the last year [3 years, say, duration of the current assignment], name the 3 people whose\ngrowth you’ve most contributed to. Please explain in significant detail where each was at the\nbeginning of the year, where he or she is today, and where each is heading in the next 12 and 24\nand 60 months. Please explain in detail your development strategy in each case. Please tell me\nyour biggest development disappointment this past year—looking back, could you or would you\nhave done anything differently? Please tell me about your greatest development triumph—and\ndisaster—in the last ten years. What are the ‘three big things’ you’ve learned about ‘people\ndevelopment’ along the way?”\n41\nFor starters, give yourself a soul-searching/soul-searing exam:\nPlease list.\n5 people.\nWhose development you have contributed to.\nDirectly &#x26; Profoundly.\nIn the last 24 months.</p>\n<p>PEOPLE</p>\n<ol start=\"96\">\n<li>It’s All About … the Quality of the Workforce. The formulation that follows came from a</li>\n</ol>\n<p>speech I gave in Shanghai in the spring of 2009. I was part of a program that included renowned\nconsultants, economists, etc. I began by saying, “In the next several hours you will hear many\nprescriptions for dealing with today’s shaky times—and preparing for China’s future. Many of\nthose prescriptions will involve the role of the government in manipulating economic levers, the\nsorts of help that big firms and SMEs will need, etc. I will doubtless find myself in agreement\nwith many, probably most, of the suggestions made.” But then I added that my role was to\nsimplify, to boldly and perhaps foolhardily assert that, regardless of economic levers pulled, there\nwas in fact only … One Thing that Really Mattered in the long run to the health of the\nenterprise—and, indeed, the economy as a whole: the quality and character of the work force.\n(And, concomitantly, the unstinting “24/7” devotion of enterprise leaders to developing each and\nevery member of that work force.)\nThis applies throughout the world—in America and Brazil and Lithuania and Estonia and Korea.\nAnd in China, as it pursues a future obviously more and more dependent on incorporating\nintellectual capital and creativity into its economic portfolio (already China bridles at being\nassigned a role as “the world’s workshop”). This applies to 100% of people in the workforce. As\nin a football team or symphony orchestra, there are no “bit players.” This applies in every\nindustry and for every price-point strategy therein. In Brazil, Magazine Luiza, the country’s\nWal*Mart, is invariably near the top of the “Best Companies to Work For” list, just as Wegmans,\nthe regional grocer, and the Container Store are at the head of the pack, peers of Google and\nAmgen, on the American “Best” list. This applies to companies of all sizes—from microscopic to\nhumongous. This applies in good times—and especially in bad times. Engaged workers and an\nunwavering commitment to Excellence from those workers are not the whole story—but they are\nthe bedrock upon which all else is built.\n97. Up with People! As in: Increase Your People Budget. There’s a convenience store near\nme. They undertook what I’d guess was a $500,000 physical renovation.\nBravo!\nExcept …\nThe staff attitude, previously crappy, is as crappy as ever. And it’s all the more obviously crappy\nin what’s now a great-looking space. Frankly, I feel the owners pretty much pissed away the\n$500,000! That is: I’ll trade a paint job for a terrific attitude any day!\n42\nIt calls to mind a Very Big Issue. It’s so easy to get caught up with the capital budget. The capital\nexpenditure:\nIt’s “permanent”!\nYou can take pictures of the result!\nIt doesn’t take sick days!\nThe people budget, on the other hand, is …\nAll about intangibles.\n“Soft stuff.”\nNo photo ops to speak of.\nSo here’s my dogmatic suggestion: When you’ve absolutely, positively, unequivocally locked\ndown your budget for the next year, I beg you to pick the lock. Please, please, please: Cut the\nprojected capital expenditures by 15 percent. And: Redirect those savings to the people budget\n(recruiting, training, perks, pay, extra staffing, whatever) … penny for penny or million for\nmillion!\n98. Cherish the Last Two-Percenters. Simply put, one cannot overestimate the value of …\n“the last two-percenter.” That person who, at 2 a.m., takes one final look at the presentation to the\nBoard tomorrow, and discovers that two key numbers are transposed on the footnote on Slide\n47—and then looks “one [more] last time” when she returns at 5:45 a.m. The carpenter who,\nthough technically “finished,” adds one final touch that alters the character of the cabinet he’s\nspent two weeks building, and then hauls the piece back to his shop for a significant (to him)\nrevision. Etc.\nSometimes we call the last two-percenter a “pain in the ass.” True, but no one (LITERALLY NO\nONE!) is of greater importance to the success of what we do. Recognize and reward the “pain in\nthe ass” “last two-percenter” as if she were the Ultimate Gift from The Gods. She is!\n99. The Excitement Axiom—and the People Corollary.\nAxiom: Only Excited People can excite customers over the long haul—i.e., again &#x26; again.\nCorollary: To cause our colleagues to be Excited we must put—and keep—the maintenance of\ntheir well-being and their opportunity structure at the Top of our agenda.\nWhich must necessarily mean that …\n(1) the employee who serves the paying customer is for the leader, in fact, her primary customer;\n(2) hence the paying customer actually comes second.\n(Which is what Southwest founder Herb Kelleher, RE/MAX founder Dave Liniger, and former\nRosenbluth International boss Hal Rosenbluth, among others, would say. I have learned at their\nfeet and cribbed directly from all three of them.)\nBottom line:\nWant to put the customer first?\nThen put the customer second!\n43\nPledge of Enterprise Allegiance: I hereby promise to …\nFirst and Foremost\nCherish and Excite the People\nWho in Turn Have the Opportunity to\nCherish and Excite the Customer\nAnd Induce the Customer to Recommend Us to Others\nWhich is the Premier Path to Growth and Profitability.\nForever and Ever,\nAmen.\nGENDER\n100. Pronoun Power!—Or: The Customer Is a “She.”</p>\n<p>“Forget China, India and the Internet: Economic Growth Is Driven by Women.”—Headline, the\nEconomist\n“One thing is certain: Women’s rise to power, which is linked to the increase in wealth per capita,\nis happening in all domains and at all levels of society. Women are no longer content to provide\nefficient labor or to be consumers. … With rising budgets and more autonomy to spend, this is\njust the beginning. The phenomenon will only grow as girls prove to be more successful than boys\nin the school system. For a number of observers, we have already entered the age of\n‘womenomics,’ the economy as thought out and practiced by a woman.”—Aude Zieseniss de\nThuin, founder of the Women’s Forum for the Economy and Society, rated one of the top five\nglobal forums by the Financial Times\nHey, g-u-y-s:\nIf women are your/our primary customers (they usually are, commercial as well as consumer\ngoods in the U.S.), knock off the likes of football analogies. If women are your/our primary\ncustomers, always (ALWAYS!) refer to the generic customer as … “she.” There’s obviously lots\nand lots and lots more to this issue—it’s been an obsession of mine since 1996. But … language\nmatters.\n“She.”\nStarting.\nNow.\nPeriod.\n101. Women Lead! (Can Men Learn to Be Good Sports About It?) A main message of The\nLittle BIG Things deals with the-”soft”-stuff-that-is-really-the-”hard”-stuff that underpins\norganization and individual effectiveness. Fact is, a lot of “this stuff” (e.g., primacy of\nrelationship development) comes pretty naturally to most women—and is Big News and a\nstruggle to most males. Hence, I wonder sometimes, mostly as I toss and turn in bed, if this book,\nand its ilk, have much or any relevance to women. Or do some-many-most-damn near all women\nreaders laugh themselves silly as, one more time, I treat the obvious as the un-obvious? (E.g.,\n“Listening is a … Very Good Thing.“) Consider just one compelling example, from “Gender\n44\nExperiments Surprise Even the Experts,” a chapter sub-title in Leadership and the Sexes: Using\nGender Science to Create Success in Business, by Michael Gurian and Barbara Annis:\n“In the 1990s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/CBC created a short film that recorded an\nexperiment in leadership styles between women and men. CBC didn’t tell the participants the\nobjective of the work they would do that day; the director simply divided the male and female\nleaders into two teams, and gave those team leaders the same directions: build an adventure\ncamp. The teams were set up in a somewhat militaristic style at first, including team members\nwearing uniforms, but also with the caveat in place that the teams could alter their style and\nmethod as they wished as long as they met the outcome in time.\n“Leader one immediately created a rank-and-file hierarchy and gave orders, even going so far as\nto assert authority by challenging members on whether they had polished their shoes. Leader two\ndid not have the ‘troops’ line up and be inspected, but instead met with the other team members in\na circle, asking ‘How are we doing? Are we ready?’ ‘Anything else we should do?’ ‘Do you think\nthey’ll test us on whether we’ve polished our shoes?’ Instead of giving orders, leader two was\ntouching team members on the arm to reassure them.\n“As part of the program, CBC arranged for corporate commentators to watch the teams prepare.\nInitially the commentators (mostly men) were not impressed by the leadership style of leader two;\nthe second team wasn’t ‘under control,’ members weren’t lined up, and they ‘lacked order’ (or so\nit seemed). The commentators predicted that team two would not successfully complete the task.\nYet, when the project was completed, team two had built an impressive adventure camp as good\nas team one’s, with some aspects that were judged as better.\n“When de-briefing their observations, the commentators noticed that when team one was building\nthe structures for the camp, there had been discord regarding who was in charge and who had\ncompleted which job and who hadn’t. Team one exhibited a lack of communication during the\nprocess of completion that created problems (for example, ‘Wasn’t someone else supposed to do\nthis?‘) Team two, on the other hand, took longer to do certain things, but because of its emphasis\non communication and collaboration during the enactment of the task (such as ‘Let’s try this’ and\n‘What do you think about that?’), the team met the goal of building the adventure camp in its own\npositive way, and on time.”\nInteresting, eh?\nLessons to learn: Many &#x26; Profound.\nOver to you.\n102. Men, “Get the Facts”: Women Are Different. I love the writer Anita Shreve. I recently\nread her superb The Weight of Water. Few writers—and virtually no male writers, as I see it—\ndeal so lucidly or movingly or in such depth, with life’s painful tangles of relationships. Simple\nfact: Women by and large instinctively appreciate complex, inchoate sets of human relationships.\nMen are more or less clueless. (Research, including recent neurobiological research, increasingly\nsupports this dichotomy.) Translating this into the emotion-driven, all-important-these-days\nworld of design, I have by and large concluded, after 1.5 decades of study and writing and\ncontemplation:\nMEN CANNOT EFFECTIVELY DESIGN PRODUCTS-SERVICES-EXPERIENCES FOR\nWOMEN.\nMEN CANNOT EFFECTIVELY SELL OR MARKET TO WOMEN.\nMEN WHO DISAGREE WITH THIS ARE DELUSIONAL.\n45\nI can’t change that, hard as I may try. But I can do … something (and so can you):\nI PLEDGE … THAT I WILL NEVER ENGAGE IN ANY SORT OF DISCUSSION OF\nPRODUCTS-SERVICES-EXPERIENCES THAT INCLUDE WOMEN AS CUSTOMERSCLIENTS, UNLESS ONE THIRD OR MORE OF THOSE PRESENT AND IN POSITIONS OF\nAUTHORITY ARE WOMEN.\nI PLEDGE … THAT I WILL WORK TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN’S VIEWS\nARE HEARD FIRST &#x26; LAST AND ARE CLEARLY INCORPORATED IN A\nCOMMANDING WAY IN ANY AND ALL ACTION PLANS INVOLVING THE\nDEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.\nI FURTHER PLEDGE … THAT I WILL BECOME A “PIONEER” IN GETTING WOMENCENTRIC VIEWS CLEARLY INTO THE MAINSTREAM—AND WILL WORK\nTIRELESSLY TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN’S REPRESENTATION IN ANY AND ALL\nLEADERSHIP POSITIONS IS AT LEAST CONSISTENT WITH THE SHAPE OF THE\nMARKETS WE SERVE OR WISH TO SERVE.\n(I’m not asking you to follow this slavishly—obviously there’s no reason to think you would. And\nI know I’ve become a radical on this topic—not as a matter of social justice, but instead for\nreasons economic, namely the enormity of the opportunity and the fact that so few “get it”\n“strategically” and thus “leave so much on the table.” On the other hand, I think it’d be hard to\ndispute a more or less “pledge” that’s more or less like what you see here. Your call, obviously—\nwhy not discuss it with colleagues?)\n103. Dressed for Success? Or: What the History of the Women’s Suffrage Movement\nTaught Me About Innovation. I cross-dressed for the first time on March 31, 2007. I went to\na local (Dorset VT) costume party, and tried valiantly to represent Elizabeth Cady Stanton,\nrightfully called the Mother of the American Women’s Rights/Women’s Suffrage Movement. I\nwas shamefaced as I prepared to play Ms. Stanton-for-an-evening—shamed, after almost fifteen\nyears of loudly and doggedly championing change to women’s still diminished role in business\nand government, that I was almost totally ignorant of the astounding history of the American\nWomen’s Rights Movement. This story describes a personal journey (mine) away from ignorance,\na journey that was, well, a blast—and, I believe, important. (I now speak noisily for far greater\nattention to the history of the women’s movement—still woefully skimpy; a condition not\ncorrected to this day.) I also dwell on this story because innovation, including social innovation,\nis the “business” theme nearest and dearest to my professional heart—and the most important\nbusiness issue of this and, frankly, every era. It is my longstanding argument that all innovation is\nirrational, non-linear, and anything but the product of plans and focus groups; it is instead about\nanger to the point of rage that eventually boils over (from suffrage to the personal computer); “a\nlittle band of brothers” (whoops, the five Great Sisters of Seneca Falls and a slew of successors);\nwillingness to suffer vicious smear attacks and unspeakable opprobrium of both a professional\nand personal nature, passion (!!!); relentlessness(!!!—72 years, 1 month and 7 days—from lunch\nat Seneca Falls on July 13, 1848 through 909 (!!) political campaigns to ratification of the 19th\nAmendment by Tennessee, the 36th state to do so, courtesy a 49-47 vote on August 18, 1920);\nresilience to deal with setback upon setback upon setback.\nAll the above made the sacrifice of wearing a wig and a long dress for five hours, in honor of\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, seem like small beer! My hero, Ms. Stanton, per Elisabeth Griffith, In\nHer Own Right: The Life of Elizabeth Cady Stanton:\n46\n“She was defeated again and again and again, but she continued the struggle with passionate\nimpatience.”\n“She had survived her husband, outlived most of her enemies, and exhausted her allies. Her mind\nremained alert, her mood optimistic, and her manner combative.” [ECS 80th birthday celebration,\nattended by 6,000 people]\nLessons? I’ve got just one:\nA record of 1 win and 908 losses [a “batting average” of .001 in 909 political campaigns] is just\nfine &#x26; dandy—and more than good enough for the Hall of Fame—if the cause is worth the effort\nand pain and personal opprobrium!\nINNOVATION\n104. The Audacity of … Research!\nIn good times and bad. There are lots of sexy innovation strategies—I’ve championed many of\nthem. But there’s also good, old-fashioned spending on R&#x26;D—and protecting-the-hell-out-of\nR&#x26;D in tough times.\nIn big firms and small. Aggressive R&#x26;D is not just the provenance of the big company. In fact, it\nis arguably more important to the 2-person Professional Service Firm than the lumbering giant.\nIn every department. AGGRESSIVE R&#x26;D IS AS IMPORTANT IN FINANCE and\nPURCHASING and HR and LOGISTICS as in IT or NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT!!!\nThroughout the “supply chain!” Having vendors, suppliers, customers, etc., that are top-quartile\nin R&#x26;D spending in their industries is of the utmost importance.\nIn Systems! Innovative systems are as important as innovative products.\nBy giving everyone “play” money—think “Micro-R&#x26;D.” Giving everyone in the organization the\nopportunity to get their hands on a few bucks (and a mentor) in order to play around (right term)\nwith a new idea is essential.\nBy thinking “Venture Capital.” Internal VC funds can run to billions of $$$ at an Intel, but the\nanimating idea is to cast a wide, speculative net for potential investments. This could mean, for a\nrestaurant owner, the likes of a $10,000 scholarship for a star-in-the-making chef to attend a topflight cooking course in France.\nBy reaching out to universities. Associations, large and small, with research universities are an\nimportant part of the innovative enterprise’s R&#x26;D strategy.\n105. Adhocracy—Love It or Leave It. In my experience, most truly innovative projects\ninvent themselves, as opposed to being the product of a formal planning process; and their\ngrowth, too, is mostly organic, and constantly punctuated by odd twists and turns. An effective\nculture of innovation, then, is largely ad hoc—which drives many traditional senior managers\n47\ncrazy. To them, “adhocracy” is little better than “mobocracy.” But if they can’t “get it,” they don’t\nbelong.\n106. Beyond Excellence: The “Berserk Standard.”\nAmazon has changed the world.\neBay has changed the world.\nCraigslist has changed the world—put about a zillion nails in the coffins of newspapers, among\nmany other Richter 8.0+ things. Craigslist has more traffic than Amazon or eBay; though a\nprivate company, Craigslist has a projected market capitalization numbering in the billions of\ndollars.\nAmazon has 20,000 employees.\neBay has 16,000 employees.\nCraigslist has … 30 employees.\nThere is more than one way to skin a cat—even a thoroughly modern cat.\nMessage: Never get seriously underway on a project of any sort until you’ve surfaced a couple of\nideas that score perfect 10s, or at least 8s, on what I call … The Berserk Scale—e.g. 14,000 or\n20,000 vs. 30.\n107. Out of the Shadows: Skunkworks, Revisited. Lockheed invented the term “Skunk\nWorks”—a small unit born in 1943 and based in Burbank, CA, that used a totally unconventional\napproach to developing essential military aircraft such as the famous SR-71 Blackbird spy plane,\na pillar of our Cold War tactical package, in record time at minimum cost with maximum\ninnovation executed by an astonishingly small group of astonishingly motivated people. (Their 1st\nproject was the XP80, the 1st tactical jet fighter—75 guys, 143 days start to prototype.) I came\nacross the Skunk Works in the early 1980s—and immediately fell madly in love. I had long been\nconvinced that “normal pathways” would not yield innovation at Big Companies. And I was on\nthe lookout for byways—places that stunk to the reigning bureaucrats. And Skunk Works, or\nSkunkworks as I prefer, filled the bill perfectly.\nSo the generic “Skunk Works idea” is a “band of brothers and sisters,” contrarian in nature and\ndetermined to do it their own way, who live in the netherworld, who stink-up-the-central-culture\nas they pursue what they believe is an earth-shattering dream. (Companies like Xerox and Apple\nhave used these units to great—yes, earth-shattering—advantage.) The idea as we packaged it\nwas picked up by numerous companies-e.g., a Pitney Bowes unit rented an unused restaurant\nabout 12 miles from HQ, and a little team-of-more-or-less-freaks cobbled together a remarkable\nproduct in a few weeks.\n108. S.A.V. (No, It’s Not a Kind of Truck.)</p>\n<p>“If I had said ‘yes’ to all the projects I turned down and ‘no’ to all the ones I took, it would have\nworked out about the same.”—David Picker, movie studio exec, quoted in William Goldman’s\nclassic Adventures in the Screen Trade (cited by Caltech physics professor and author Leonard\nMlodinow in The Drunkard’s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives)\n“Ever notice that ‘What the hell’ is always the right decision?”—a shrewd observation, attributed\nto an unknown Hollywood scriptwriter\n48\nIf, as I fervently believe … Randomness Rules Our Lives … then your … only (logical) … defense\nis-must be taking refuge in the message of the so-called “law of large numbers”—that is, any\nsuccess follows from tryin’ enough stuff so that the odds of doin’ something right tilt your way.\nUltimate &#x26; Perhaps Only “Sure-fire” Winning Formula:\nS.A.V.*\n<em>Screw Around Vigorously.\n109. What Have You Prototyped Lately?\n“Effective prototyping may be the most valuable core competence an innovative organization can\nhope to have.”—Michael Schrage\n“You can’t be a serious innovator unless and until you are ready, willing and able to seriously\nplay. ‘Serious play’ is not an oxymoron; it is the essence of innovation.”—Michael Schrage,\nSerious Play\nDon’t let yourself get stuck!\n(What a silly statement.)\nFact: There is … ALWAYS … something … some little thing … you can start/do in the next … 30\nminutes … to make a wee, concrete step forward toward solving a problem or creating a new\nopportunity. My colleagues and I call this the … “Quick Prototype Attitude.” MIT’s Michael\nSchrage tells us that innovation … is … the reaction to a prototype. To move forward, you must\nhave some eighth-baked thing to talk about and shoot at and tinker with … ASAP.\n110. Hell Hath No Fury: Celebrate “Disturbers of the Peace.”\n“What drove Trippe? A fury that the future was always being hijacked by people with smaller\nideas—by his first partners who did not want to expand airmail routes; by nations that protected\nflag carriers with subsidies; by elitists who regarded flight, like luxury liners, as a privilege to be\nenjoyed only by the few; by cartel operators who rigged prices. The democratization he effected\nwas as real as Henry Ford’s.” —Harold Evans, on legendary PanAm boss Juan Trippe\nI believe that the Mother of [Almost] All Innovation is … FURY. Abiding anger at the way things\nare… coupled with an “irrational” (statistically inappropriate) determination to beat back the\ninnumerable protectors of the status quo and find and implement a better way.\nAn innovator’s life, almost regardless of the size of the innovation (people fight the small ones\nabout as tenaciously as the large ones), is pure hell. All guardians of the status quo are her\nenemies. That includes about 100 percent of her bosses, appointed stalwart custodians of “the\nway we do things around here.” Why is fury required? Simple: In order to survive the onslaught\nof these Powerful Guardians of Yesterday, and come out the other end in tact, she has to be really\npumped up 100.00% of the time, and equipped with very thick skin indeed—that is, really truly\npissed off with the way things are.\n49\n111. The Innovation10: What We Know So Far … Libraries are full of books written about\ninnovation. Nonetheless, I felt a pressing need here to devote an item to summarizing my four\ndecades of noodling on this subject:\n(1) Try it. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. He who tries the most stuff wins.\n(2) Prototype it. A particular form of trying—some model of some part of “it” that everybody\nquickly has an opportunity shoot at.\n(3) Celebrate failure. Keyword: CELEBRATE. Not “tolerate,” but “celebrate”—if “most tries”\nare king, then “most failures” are necessarily crown prince.\n(4) Hang Out Axiom. Every “hang out” decision is an innovation decision: Yes. Or: No. That is,\nhang out with interesting, get more interesting. Hang out with ordinary, get more ordinary.\n(5) Diversity. That is, diversity on any damned dimension imaginable. In any and every situation.\nMore variety = Higher odds of success!\n(6) Parallel Universe. Frequently the resistance to change is so strenuous that one must, in effect,\ngive up on normal channels. So create a pretty-damn-separate “new world” (new folks, new\nlocation, new attitude, etc., etc.)—a parallel universe.\n(7) XFX/Cross-functional Excellence. Ninety percent (95 percent?) of innovation requires\nworking across functional borders, so Border Bashing/X-border Love is key to innovation\nsuccess.\n(8) R&#x26;D Equality. “Research” is not the exclusive provenance of the new product folks. Every\ndepartment needs a well-funded, highly regarded R&#x26;D activity; the clear expectation is that every\nunit/function will be as well-known for its innovation record as for its execution of standard tasks.\n(9) Hire and promote innovators. The best test of innovation potential is … a track record in\ninnovation. If you are assessing a 26-year-old candidate and there are no cases-of-innovationworth-bragging-about in his past—then don’t expect much in the future.\n(10) Fun! Innovating is about breaking the rules—often our rules. There is a certain\nmischievousness about innovative organizations—not fun &#x26; games, but pleasure in sticking a\nfinger in convention’s eye, especially one or more of our own conventions.\nLISTENING\n112.

Are You an “18-Second Manager”?\n“He [Christopher] had learned when he was still very young that if he kept quiet, the other\nperson would eventually fill the silence: ‘Everyone has a story to tell, if only you have the\npatience to wait for it and not get in the way of it.‘”—Charles McCarry, Christopher’s Ghosts, on\nthe protagonist, Paul Christopher, a CIA field officer\nIn How Doctors Think, Dr. Jerome Groopman reports that … the best source of evidence … on a\npatient’s malady is … the patient.

Reward DNK (Do Not Know) Bosses and “brilliant” staffers are very prone to falling\ninto the trap of not admitting when they don’t know the answer or have trouble with the concept.\n(CEOs pocketing $75,000,000 bonuses didn’t grock the Super-derivatives served up by their U.\nChicago math Ph.D.s—welcome to Recessionus Gargantuas.) The boss thinks “I’m supposed to\nknow that”—and is loath to admit that he doesn’t. He rarely lies outright, but he is very inclined to\nobfuscate his ignorance. So, too, those “brilliant” staffers who are paid large sums to be brilliant,\nnot to not know.\nFact is, we should not only readily (gleefully?—“that’s what I hired you for”) admit when we do\nnot know something, but also actively seek out things we do not know, or “DNKs.” Perhaps start\nmeetings by asking, “What are our DNKs here?” (And end the meeting the same way.) We can,\nand should, make it positive … and praiseworthy … for anyone to say “DNK” when\nhe/she/you/me DNK. Publicly cheer the person who admits—in front of a boss—that he or she\n“does not know” the facts here, or the answer to this or that. In fact, you might make a game (a\nserious game!) out of identifying the “DNKs” regarding any analysis or proposed action.\n117. Work the Watercooler—Or: Are You Gossiping Enough? The human brain is about\nnine times bigger, on a body-size-adjusted basis, than that of mammals in general. The reason is\nfascinating—and mostly counterintuitive. We are, of course, a long way from being the strongest\nof the species. So how did we win out over the Truly Big Dudes? Answer: Not by intellectual\nskill at calculating warhead (spear) trajectories, but by joining together in groups and outwitting\nand out-organizing the brutes. And what brought these groups of humans together? A brain that\ngrew to accommodate: Gossip! As British evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar puts it, our\nbrains expanded almost entirely to store social information. This “relationship stuff” allowed us to\n53\nmanufacture the “social glue” that would underpin co-habiting in sizeable bands; by developing\nsocial cohesion skills, we improved or maximized what we now call “organizational\neffectiveness” … and became Kings and Queens of the jungle and beyond.\nMy point here is to suggest that anyone, as so many (esp. males) do, who dismisses or diminishes\n“relationship stuff” and “communication stuff”—and in particular “political stuff”—as “the soft\nstuff” is not only an ignorant damn fool, but also denying the essence of what it means to be\nhuman.</p>\n<p>LEARNING</p>\n<ol start=\"118\">\n<li>Making the Grade: Lifelong Learning Is a Mission Statement Must.

Now Enrolling: “The People’s MBA.” I have long been a vociferous critic of the\nMBA—such criticism was the de facto point of In Search of Excellence. Bob Waterman and I,\nthough both engineers (Waterman in Mining, me in Civil) and both Stanford MBAs and both\nMcKinsey consultants (the latter a Mecca of cold-blooded business analysis), lamented business’s\nabiding emphasis on the numbers and its accompanying de facto and de jure de-emphasis of the\nso-called “soft” “people stuff.” Now, with tongue only slightly in cheek, I hereby offer the core\ncourses in my prospective MBA curriculum, without comment:\n*Managing People I, II, III\n*Servant Leadership I, II\n*Execution I, II, III\n*Creating a “Try it now” environment/Celebrating Failure\n*Maximizing R.O.I.R.

Time Off for Smart Behavior. Hustle rules. But the very same times that call for speedspeed-speed also call for exceptional creativity, and that doesn’t always match up with 90-hour\nworkweeks—especially back-to-back-to-back 90-hour weeks. So, in the course of the day, week,\nyear, figure out how to take a pause—even a 2-minute “right breathing” break, like I do—that\nrefreshes.\nAnd take it.\n(This is of the utmost importance. Believe it.)\n125. Time Out for … Daydreaming! Dov Frohman is a pioneer in the semiconductor industry.\nAmong (many) other things, he started Intel Israel and was significantly responsible for the\ngrowth of Israel’s potent high-tech sector. With Robert Howard, he presented us with a truly\noriginal book on leadership, Leadership the Hard Way: Why Leadership Can’t Be Taught—and\nHow You Can Learn It Anyway. In a chapter titled “The Soft Skills of Hard Leadership,” Frohman\nastonishes as he insists that the leader-manager must free up no less than 50 percent of his-her\ntime from routine tasks:\n“Most managers spend a great deal of time thinking about what they plan to do, but relatively\nlittle time thinking about what they plan not to do. … As a result, they become so caught up in\nfighting the fires of the moment that they cannot really attend to the long-term threats and risks\nfacing the organization. So the premier soft skill of leadership the hard way is to cultivate the\nperspective of Marcus Aurelius: avoid busyness, free up your time, stay focused on what really\nmatters. Let me put it bluntly: every leader should routinely keep a substantial portion of his or\nher time—I would say as much as 50 percent—unscheduled. Only when you have substantial\n‘slop’ in your schedule—unscheduled time—will you have the space to reflect on what you are\ndoing, learn from experience, and recover from your inevitable mistakes. Leaders without such\nfree time end up tackling issues only when there is an immediate or visible problem. Managers’\ntypical response to my argument about free time is, ‘That’s all well and good, but there are things\nI have to do.’ Yet we waste so much time in unproductive activity—it takes an enormous effort on\nthe part of the leader to keep free time for the truly important things.”\nThe chapter’s second mind-ripping idea is labeled “The Discipline of Daydreaming”: “Nearly\nevery major decision of my business career was, to some degree, the result of daydreaming. … To\nbe sure, in every case I had to collect a lot of data, do detailed analysis, and make a data-based\nargument to convince superiors, colleagues and business partners. But that all came later. In the\nbeginning, there was the daydream. By daydreaming, I mean loose, unstructured thinking with no\n56\nparticular goal in mind. … In fact, I think daydreaming is a distinctive mode of cognition\nespecially well suited to the complex, ‘fuzzy’ problems that characterize a more turbulent business\nenvironment. … Daydreaming is an effective way of coping with complexity. When a problem has\na high degree of complexity, the level of detail can be overwhelming. The more one focuses on the\ndetails, the more one risks being lost in them. … Every child knows how to daydream. But many,\nperhaps most, lose the capacity as they grow up. …”\n126. Master the Art of Milestoning. My latest trip from VT to MA (173.6 mi) got me\nthinking of something else besides pit stops. I was running late, and noting my progress via\nodometer and various landmarks and highway markers. As my mood went up and down I realized\n(re-realized?) the power of manageable goals in every form of activity:\n(1) Milestones are all-important, no matter how trivial or repetitive the task.\n(2) “Milestoning” is a real art for reasons psychological, as much as or more than for reasons of\n“substance.”\n(3) Truly trivial milestones are often meaningless, even if they are “accomplishments” of a sort\nand “milestones” of a sort—scoring the eyedrop’s distance from the Dorset turn to the Stratton\nturn is no big deal and not really a motivator.\n(4) “Milestone power” is variable. E.g., at the beginning or near the end of a task, the apparently\ntrivial can indeed seem utterly grand. “Well, I’ve done something”—that’s what I feel seconds\nafter 4 a.m. when I make it to the immediate end of the farm road that starts at our house, thus\nputting behind me the first click, or 0.7 miles, in numbing reality a scant 0.4 percent of the whole.\n(5) There is a definite sweetspot … “the perfect milestone.” The 13 miles from home to Dorset, or\nthe 12 miles from Gill to Erving, is a winner—substantial enough to matter, to merit a pumped\nfist at 4:23 a.m., and to constitute “progress of note.”\n(6) There is a fine line between “trivial” on the one end and “daunting” on the other. (A 27-mile\nstretch, if thought of that way, is downright discouraging: “Dear God, these 27 miles of Route 2\nare frigging endless.“)\nAction: Become a “milestone activist.” Use milestoning, for instance, on every project, large or\nsmall, as a matter of routine, but do so with the greatest care, as only partially explained above—\nthat is, become a Milestone Professional as well as a Milestone Activist. These project landmarks,\nthe establishment and celebration thereof, can have an enormous impact on the energy and\nmotivation of a team.\nDESIGN</p>\n<ol start=\"127\">\n<li>Design Is … Everywhere!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“Everything is design.”—from Richard Farson, The Power of Design: A Force for Transforming\nEverything\n“Design” means the string of gorgeous products from Apple or OXO or Herman Miller or John\nDeere. But it applies equally to the “presentation” of the training course you are about to deliver.\nAnd “design mindfulness” is at the heart of the new purchasing process about to be unveiled—in\na 20-person organization. And it’s the soul of the reception area in a 3-person accountancy; and\nthe very heart of the Formal Reports that same accountancy delivers. Hence, if you are serious\nabout design, among other things:\n57\n(1) It becomes part of every (e-v-e-r-y) project, tiny to grand, in every (e-v-e-r-y)\ndepartment.\n(2) Every project has a formal “design advocate.”\n(3) Everyone is encouraged through example to become “design minded.” (And\nit’s part of their formal evaluation.) (Everyone = General management to\nhousekeeping at the hotel, Managing Partner to receptionist at the\naccountancy or consultancy.)\n(4) Design is always considered on five dimensions: (a) usability, (b) simplicity,\n(c) aesthetics, (d) “Cool”/“Wow”/“Gaspworthy,” and (5) EXCELLENCE.\n(5) Every work space is a living example of Excellence in design—it sings “our\nsong.”\n(6) Design EXCELLENCE applies to every business process as much as to every\nproduct.\n(7) Design per se is explicitly addressed in every written work plan.\n(8) While design is not always “free,” design-mindedness is not a cost item—and\nEXCELLENCE in design applies at least as much at the “low end” as at the\nluxury end of a market.\n(9) Design Reviews are part of all project reviews.\n(10) If you are a/the Big Boss, there should be a … Chief Design Officer … who\nlives in the “power corridor” with the Chief Financial Officer, Chief\nMarketing Officer, etc. (If you are a “little boss,” there should be an\nappointed “design champion” whose collateral duty is to represent the\n“design view” in all the unit’s work product.)\n(11) “Design-mindfulness” or “EXCELLENCE in design” should (must!) be part\nof the organization’s Core Values Statement.\n(12) Design per se should be directly and indirectly part of all training programs.\n128. Is It “Lickable”? Steve Jobs says that the definition of a superbly designed product is\none you … “want to lick.” BMW advertised a new model car as … Radically Thrilling.\nEconomists agree that inducing people to re-open their wallets is a major part of the cure to the\nrecession. And I claim it all boils down to the right kind of hammer. A hammer you … want to\nlick. A hammer that is … radically thrilling. And a hammer that … induces you to make an\nexpenditure that you hadn’t intended to make. That is, my Tuf-E-Nuf hammer. This gorgeous\nlittle hammer, actually the … Tuf-E-Nuf Mini Striker Stubby Claw Hammer … is a true\ninnovation, even an earth-shattering innovation. (By my lights.) The head looks like and has the\nheft of a regular heavy hammer. But the full-diameter handle is only five inches long, half the\nnormal length. And the grip is great, up to the standard of the easy-to-hold OXO kitchen tool line.\nThe net result is the ability to maneuver in tight spots while retaining almost all the power of a\nfull-size hammer—and, as a bonus, owning a piece of sculptural art! I ended up buying six of the\nbloody things for Christmas presents last year—including, Christmas spirit be damned, one as a\npresent to myself, which I use as a paperweight or bookend when not whacking nails!\nSo:\nGreat design rules!\nInnovation is king!\nFunctionality scores!\nLickability and Radically Thrilling are the standards worth shooting for!\n(And … there is more to design—and life—than iPods and iPhones!)\n58\n129. Design Sign: Can You Get There from Here? The closest I’ve come to being late to a\nspeech was attributable to … lousy directions. It was at a big convention center—it ran for blocks\nand blocks. The driver and I puzzled at the directions—and the client’s cell phone was not\nreceiving. I finally picked a place, got out, and started hunting. Literally 25 minutes later, fit to be\ntied, I made it to my destination. It got me thinking: Directions, signs, manuals are life’s blood, in\nthis case and more or less in general. And most directions-signs-manuals are, well … pathetic.\nBut, these guides (directions-signs-manuals) ought to be … Works of Art (damn it). … Plusses\nrather than Minuses … Full-scale Members of the “Value-added” Package. They should top the\ncharts on dimensions such as these:\nClear!\nSimple!\nEngaging!\nBeautiful!\nAnd: Breathtaking! (Why not?)\n130. Love + Hate = Design Power. Design is all about … emotion. Moreover, it’s not about\n“liking” something—or “disliking” it. Design’s … awesome power … comes precisely from the\nfact that it is about unvarnished emotion, about … LOVE. And … HATE.\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE the simplicity of the controls on my Black &#x26; Decker coffeemaker. One\nswitch: ON. Or: OFF.\nI HATE HATE HATE (HATE HATE) the THREE devices it takes to control my satellite TV and\nDVD player.\nThat’s design.\nLove!\nHate!\nUltimate power tool!\n(Applies to … absolutely everything!)</p>\n<p>DETAILS</p>\n<ol start=\"131\">\n<li>The Case of the Two-cent Candy Years ago, I wrote about a retail store in the Palo Alto</li>\n</ol>\n<p>environs, a good one, which had a box of two-cent candies at the checkout. I remembered that\n“little” parting gesture of the two-cent candy as a symbol of all that is Excellent at that store.\nDozens upon dozens of people—from retailers to bankers to plumbing supply house owners—\nwho have attended seminars of mine have come up to remind me, sometimes 15 or 20 years later,\nof “the two-cent candy story,” and to tell me how it had a sizeable impact on how they did\nbusiness, metaphorically and in fact, how they had become “fanatic 2-centers.”\nTranslation: Ask yourself … NOW: What is my (personal, department, project, restaurant, law\nfirm) “Two-cent Candy” score? Does every part of the process of working with us/me include\ntwo-cent candies? Do we, as a group, “think two-cent candies”?\nOperationalizing: Make “two-centing it” part and parcel of “the way we do business around here.”\nDon’t go light on the so-called “substance”—but do remember that … perception is reality … and\nperception is shaped by two-cent candies as much as by that so-called “hard substance.” (This is a\n59\nparticularly Brilliant Idea for a recession. You doubtless don’t maximize “Two-cent\nOpportunities”—and what opportunities they are. And they only, in effect, cost 2-cents!)\n132. If The Envelope Doesn’t Fit, Forget It! Stanford, beloved (and I mean it) Stanford, sent\nme a snail-mail questionnaire in prep for my MBA reunion. I took some pains to fill it out. When\nI got ready to mail it, I discovered that it didn’t fit into the envelope they’d enclosed—I tore the\nquestionnaire up and tossed it in the recycle bin. (Ever wonder what’s wrong with MBA\nprograms? Lack of attention to envelopes!) (Ever wonder why so many small businesses fail?\nLack of attention to envelopes!)\n133. It’s All About the Mud It’s “mud season” in Vermont as I write and as we all too\nappropriately call it. Cars, and trucks in particular, look like flying mud balls. While on a\n(muddy!) speed walk, I passed through the parking lot of the Equinox Hotel, which was in the\nmidst of a massive renovation. The primary contractor was Bread Loaf Construction, out of\nMiddlebury. Bread Loaf folks must not be as smart as I think; that is, they apparently didn’t know\nit’s mud season. Every contractor’s truck in the parking lot—and the FedEx and UPS trucks, too—\nconfirmed the “mud ball” image I just suggested. Except for Bread Loaf’s. There were two BL\npickups in the lot. Both, in BL tradition, painted fire engine red. And neither—and I do not\nexaggerate—had the tiniest apparent trace of dirt or mud or even dust.\nLater in the afternoon, I was having a long interview with a top dog at the ad agency\nTBWA/Chiat/Day, and, not surprisingly, the topic turned to branding. Out of my mouth, startling\nme, popped, “Branding is a squeaky-sparkly clean bright red contractor’s truck in mud season in\nVermont.” We nattered on about the fact that branding is about, well … Everything. Nothing,\nabsolutely nothing, is irrelevant to individual branding—or the branding of a construction\ncompany in VT, or Susan Axelrod Accountants, or Megacorp, Inc. So, right now:\nCheck the reception desk.\nCheck the reception area.\nCheck the bathroom.\nCheck your last Client email.\nCheck 10 “little things.”\nRight now.\nIs each one Excellent?\nDoes each one confirm &#x26; extend &#x26; broadcast your “brand promise”?\n(Remember, a very BIG thing: You are in absolute control here! There are things you cannot\nmake happen, to be sure; but you, no matter how “junior,” or no matter what the state of the\neconomy, can project Brand Excellence via a thousand “atmospherics” that in the end\noverwhelmingly determine Client-Employee perception.)\n134. Think Billboard Sign. “We Care.” “We Don’t Care.” I was walking through a giant\nmall—visiting a renowned retailer’s space. Usually, they’re one of the best, poster practitioners of\n“experience” design &#x26; marketing.\nBut … THE PLACE WAS A MESS. To me the space … SCREAMED … “We Don’t Care.”\nThere’s a lot to Great Retailing, or great whatever. But very near or at the head of the line is: “WE\nCARE!” And it starts with “look and feel.” (To be fair, in the case under discussion, it was a\nSaturday two or three weeks before Christmas. DOESN’T MATTER! In fact, the greater the\nconfusion, the more the attention to “I care” matters-and stands out.)\n60\nWe care.\nWe don’t care.\n(Take your pick.)\n(No in-between.)\n(Really … no in between.

Become a Decentralization Dervish!\nChild rearing.\nDelegating.\nOrganization structure.\nGovernance in general.\nIn many ways, the primary issue in all these cases boils down to the classic JeffersonianHamiltonian debate on centralization vs. decentralization. (I call the centralizationdecentralization debate … “the all-important first 100 percent.” That is, it’s pretty much the whole\nballgame!)\nTrue, you will never get “it”/the centralization-decentralization balance right (nation, child\nrearing, your 27-person unit). But … I bet you (I guarantee!) that … you will s-l-o-w-l-y get it\nwrong. That is, unless … fanatically (right word) … managed, there is an inexorable movement\ntoward centralization. I call it … ICD/ Inherent Centralist Drift. As an ordained Bishop in the\nHigh Church of Decentralization, I humbly suggest that creeping centralization, or ICD, is the\ncause of the lion’s share of corporate collapses!\nHence I suggest maintaining constant (every day!) vigilance so as to limit and in fact reverse the\nproliferation of originally-sound-procedures-collectively-become-bureaucratic-cancer. Effective\nrigidity-fighting should be an explicit part of everyone’s evaluation. Every system should be “zer-\n61\nbsed” every couple of years.

Commerce Bank (now owned by Toronto\nDominion) more or less revolutionized retail banking on the East Coast. For one thing, among\never so many, computer terminals in the branches have a … red button … on the keyboard. When\nyou (teller) run into any self(bank)-created roadblock to serving the customer … you push the red\nbutton. The impediment you discovered will be noted and formally addressed—and if action is\ntaken, and it often is, you’ll get a financial reward for having unearthed Grunge of any sort that\ngets between the customer and an excellent service experience.\nMy point-suggestion here is that you invent your flavor of highly visible Red Buttons for your 3-\nperson department, your 9-person temporary project team, your 17-table restaurant, or your 235-\nperson division. That is, mimic Commerce Bank by creating formal processes for Identifying\nGrunge and Removing Grunge and getting everyone in on the … Great Grunge Removal Game.\nThink of it at an even higher level of abstraction as a “Strategic” “Grunge Removal Culture,” a\nfull-blown philosophy supported by a formal infrastructure to try to keep the “inevitable grunge\ngrowth” in check or even reversed—and headed, of course, by the CGRO/Chief Grunge Removal\nOfficer.\nGet on with this … today!\nGrunge Grows … 60/60/24/7/365.\n138. The 1% Drill: Clearing Away a World of “Slop” in Just 45 Minutes. I co-presented\nan all-day in-company seminar in the UK several years ago. At about 2 p.m. the principal\npresenter called an abrupt halt to proceedings, and said, “I want to make sure I earn out my full\nfee today, and then some. We’re going to stop and do a 45-minute exercise.” He explained that\nany operation can at any time cut 1% of its budget. (We all have flab, regardless of\ncircumstances—not many 6 percent BMIs around.) The leader then broke the group up by\nfunction. He gave the sub-groups 30 minutes on the dot to identify their team’s 1 percent. Then he\nhad each group report in public for 2 or 3 minutes—this public recitation, he told me, raised the\nodds of execution; it also provided others with ideas. Indeed the groups readily identified their 1\npercent and reported accordingly—there was actually no bitching.\n1%? No small thing, regardless of business size.\n139. Goal: To Make “Common Sense” More Common. A lot of the giant financialeconomic mess we’re in can be chalked up to a failure of common sense, often by the so-called\nbest of the best and brightest of the bright, egging each other on with a series of implicit “I dare\nyous.” We are all, in fact, “insiders” in our own worlds—and we all too often lose touch with\nreality to a lesser or greater extent. There are a host of things one can do to deal with this, but in\nthis instance I only want to suggest routinely running proposals or budgets, or whatever, by a\n“Common Sense Ombudsman.” Said ombudsman could be a spouse or a neighbor who owns a\nrestaurant or the down-to-earth woman running the distribution center in South Podunk who you\nchatted with at the management meeting in Orlando last year. (It absolutely cannot be someone in\nyour own unit—even a “contrarian” someone; even the so-called contrarian abides by 90 percent\nof “the way we do things around here.“)\n62\nPresumably you’ve got three or four projects running as we speak. Call your friend Jack, who\nruns finance at the local Ford dealership. Offer him box seat tickets to next week’s Royals game if\nhe’ll spend a couple of hours reviewing your project-planning docs in the next few days. Repeat\nthis process—routinely! obsessively!—with different Jacks and Janes and Annes and Rogers. The\nprice of the baseball or concert box seats will be trivial in comparison to value added and pratfalls\navoided.</p>\n<p>ENTERPRISE</p>\n<ol start=\"140\">\n<li>An Organization Is “People Serving People.” (Period!) A challenging trip to Siberia to</li>\n</ol>\n<p>give an all-day seminar got me thinking about the fundamentals of organizing and organizations.\nI surprised myself when the definition of “enterprise at its best” that follows emerged from my\nkeyboard:\nAn emotional, vital, innovative, joyful, creative, entrepreneurial endeavor that maximizes\nindividuals’ growth and elicits maximum concerted human potential in the wholehearted service\nof others.* (*Employees, Customers, Suppliers, Communities, Owners, Temporary Partners.)\nOn the one hand, this definition is pretty high-stepping. Idealistic beyond the realm of common\nsense. But examine it … one word at a time. Conjure up the word’s opposite, and consider the\npossibilities:\nDo we want an emotionless organization—or an exciting one? (That’s a practical enough\nquestion, eh?)\nDo we want a joyless organization—is joy “impractical” in the World of Work? (Since said world\nis where we spend the bulk of our conscious hours as adults, I’d hope the possibility of Joy is not\npie-in-the-sky.)\nAnd so on.\nI have used this formulation 100 times now, literally in every corner of the globe, from Seattle to\nShanghai to Riyadh to Estonia to Luanda. And to my delight, most of the people at my seminars\nsign up for the “Siberia option.” Not “sign up” in the sense of taking a blood oath, but in the sense\nof agreeing that when you examine the words … ONE AT A TIME …and when you do conjure up\nthe opposite of each word, you are likely to agree that while it is indeed a towering aspiration, it\nis not to be dismissed, either.\nOrganizations exist to serve.\nThe true bottom line: People serving people.\nIf membership in your club (organization) is not aimed at “mind-blowing” development for each\nstaff member and “window rattling” service for each customer and other extended family\nmember, then … just what the hell is the point?\n141. The PSF Mandate: “Work Worth Paying For.” At the beginning of 2008, a\nBusinessWeek cover story reported that Schlumberger may well take over the world: “THE\nGIANT STALKING BIG OIL: How Schlumberger Is Rewriting the Rules of the Energy Game.”\nIn short, Schlumberger knows how to create and run oilfields on a turnkey basis. As China and\nRussia, among others, make their move in energy, state-run companies are eclipsing the major\n63\nindependents. Aiding these new players, at the center of the Schlumberger “empire,” is a\nrelatively new outfit, reminiscent of IBM’s enormous Global Services unit (these days, Global\nServices = IBM) and UPS Logistics’ teams, which run entire supply chains for enormous\ncompanies. The Schlumberger version is called IPM, for Integrated Project Management. It lives\nin a nondescript building near Gatwick Airport, and its chief says it will do “just about anything\nan oilfield owner would want, from drilling to production.”\nAs I see it, Schlumberger is transforming itself pell-mell into what may become the biggest and\nmost powerful “PSF” (Professional Service Firm) in history. Moreover, paths like this, from IBM\nand UPS and Schlumberger, are open to many firms. Think Best Buy’s “Geek Squads,” the\nmobile service units that are Best Buy’s competitive advantage in electronics retailing; or the\n“PSF” components of many giant GE “industrial” units, which produce well over 50 percent of\nthe units’ revenues; even the likes of MasterCard are getting into the act—MasterCard Advisors\nare running entire payment systems activities for some of their clients, penetrating ever more\ndeeply into the heart of the Clients’ operations.\nIn view of all this, one of my “Top 5” Tom Rants is urging every “department” in an organization\nto re-conceive itself as a turnkey-service, de facto or de jure profit-making “PSF.” And, likewise,\nI urge companies of all flavors to consider aiming to grow through “PSF-ing”—more or less\nalong the lines of the Schlumberger-IBM-UPS-GE-MasterCard transformations. In short, I\nbelieve the “Professional Service Firm Idea” is central to many firms’, including or especially\nsmall ones, potential to differentiate themselves in today’s and tomorrow’s increasingly\ncompetitive environment. In particular, these “PSFs” can offer differentiated services limited only\nby their imagination—who would have thought that the “Geek Squads” would have led the way\nto re-positioning giant Best Buy?\n142. Don’t Let the “Enemy” Rule Your Life.\n“Obsessing about your competitors, trying to match or best their offerings, spending time each\nday wanting to know what they are doing, and/or measuring your company against them—these\nactivities have no great or winning outcome. Instead you are simply prohibiting your company\nfrom finding its own way to be truly meaningful to its Clients, staff and prospects. You block your\ncompany from finding its own identity and engaging with the people who pay the bills. … Your\ncompetitors have never paid your bills and they never will.”—Howard Mann, Your Business\nBrickyard: Getting Back to the Basics to Make Your Business More Fun to Run\nMr. Mann in turn quotes Mike McCue, former VP/Technology at Netscape: “At Netscape the\ncompetition with Microsoft was so severe, we’d wake up in the morning thinking about how we\nwere going to deal with them instead of how we would build something great for our customers.\nWhat I realize now is that you can never, ever take your eye off the customer. Even in the face of\nmassive competition, don’t think about the competition. Literally don’t think about them.”\nDon’t let the “enemy” rule your life. Try your damnedest to follow the exact advice of Mr.\nMcCue: “Literally don’t think about them.” Far, far easier said than done, no doubt, but selfawareness is a start:\nWe … are the problem.\nThey are … not … the problem.\nWe have one source only of Excellence: Us.\n64\n143. Love Your Competitors. At the top of my business priority list is a desire for my overall\nmarket to grow by leaps and bounds! Sure, as the number of people giving speeches and seminars\nand writing books and blogging and tweeting on similar topics has leapt, my “market share” has\ngone w-a-y down. (It was about 100 percent after In Search of Excellence, when I was more or\nless the only public “management guru.“) But my revenue has soared in the process—the “smaller\nshare of a much bigger pie” axiom.\nMoreover, I want (am desperate that) my competitors to do terrific work! If they do, the “guru”\nindustry’s stock as a whole, which is sometimes wobbly, will rise. In short, I want my competitors\nto thrive.\nDoes all this suggest an altruistic streak? Perhaps. But mostly not. To begin with, I think that\nwhen one badmouths or attempts to diminish one’s competitors in any way or tries to limit their\nactivities, the “word gets around.” And one develops a reputation as prickly and egocentric—and,\nwell, as a selfish jerk.\nMore important: I think (I know!) the only effective long-term defense against the competition\n(think Apple versus its stalwart competitors) is to do better and unique work—and to earn and to\nretain the custom of those who are interested in the things I worry about.\n“Win” with a remarkably better product.\n“Win” with deeper relationships.\n“Win” when your industry is prospering and has a good reputation.\nBuild up your competitors!!\nBuild up your entire industry!!\nSPECIAL SECTION: The Top 50 “Have-Yous”\nWhile waiting in the Albany airport to board a Southwest Airlines flight to Reagan one morning, I\nhappened across the latest Harvard Business Review, on the cover of which was a bright yellow\n“lead article” sticker. On it were the words “Mapping your competitive position.” It triggered a\nfurious negative “Tom reaction,” as my wife calls it. Of course I believe you should worry about\nyour “competitive position.” But instead of obsessing on competitive position and other\nabstractions, as the B.Schools and consultants would invariably have us do, I instead wondered\nabout some “practical stuff,” which I believe is far, far more important to the short- and longterm “strategic” health of the enterprise, tiny or enormous. Hence, rather than an emphasis on\ncompetitive maps or looking for a “blue ocean” (empty space, per the popular book Blue Ocean\nStrategy), I urge you to pay attention to my Top 50 “Have Yous.” The underlying hypothesis, of\ncourse, is that if you proactively do the “small” stuff below, your “competitive position” will\nimprove so much that mapping will become a secondary issue!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have you in the last 10 days … visited a customer?</li>\n<li>Have you called a customer … TODAY?</li>\n<li>Have you in the last 60-90 days … had a seminar in which several folks from the customer’s</li>\n</ol>\n<p>operation (different levels, different functions) interacted, via facilitator, with various of your\nfolks?\n4.

I was asked to keynote the first major</li>\n</ol>\n<p>conference, organized by the Australian Institute of Management, honoring the life’s work of\nPeter Drucker. I felt an enormous responsibility—and allowed my imagination to soar on the\ntopic of organizing fundamentals. I began with a barebones definition:\nOrganizations should be … no less than cathedrals in which the full and awesome power of the\nImagination and Spirit and native Entrepreneurial flair of diverse individuals is unleashed in\npassionate pursuit of … Excellence.\n“Cathedral/s” is a Big Word. My usage is not intended to be religious in any formal sense—hence\nthe lowercase “c.” But, in terms of human potential (quasi-religious?), I do see all effective\norganizations as driven … first and foremost … by an Unstinting Commitment to Members’\nGrowth.\nA classroom in a primary school should … obviously … be such a “cathedral.” But so, too, an\naccounting or training department. No doubt of it: Organizations must effectively serve their\nexternal customers to survive, let alone thrive. But my line-of-logic is, at least to me, crystal clear\nand admits no alternatives: The odds of the external customer being served effectively and in a\nway that binds them to your organization is a direct function of such service being provided by\nthose [employees] who are themselves Engaged in a Vigorous Quest for Growth and Excellence.\nNB: This challenge—organization as cathedral devoted to human development—is simply\ngargantuan, and one I thought about a lot before issuing. And by now I’ve tested the idea all over\nthe world—from Dubai to New Delhi to Helsinki to Joinville, Brazil, to San Antonio. In sit-down\ndiscussions there is agreement that “If not this, what?” is, in fact, a sane question—at least worthy\nof serious conversation. I am wholeheartedly convinced that something like this makes\ncommercial sense. (And, I repeat, if not, what’s the alternative?)\n145. Enable Dreams. (If Not, What?) Matthew Kelly’s parable-based The Dream Manager is\nnot ordinarily my kind of book. But Kelly’s premise got to me—and it has become a centerpiece\nof my work. The idea is simple: Everyone has a dream! And if we can help him and her fulfill\nthose dreams then he and she will be more engaged human beings—which will, practically\nspeaking, pay off for the organization as it strives to serve its customers.\nKelly writes: “A company’s purpose is to become the-best-version-of-itself. But an organization\ncan only become the-best-version-of-itself to the extent that the people who drive that\norganization are striving to become better-versions-of-themselves.” When you ponder that, it is\nboth obvious and profound: “We,” the team, is only as good as the engagement of and\ncommitment to personal growth and achievement and Excellence by each and every individual.\n(Obvious in football and dance—why not groceries and the accounting office?) “The question is,”\nKelly continues, “What is an employee’s purpose? Most would say, ‘to help the company achieve\nits purpose’—but they would be wrong. [Ponder, slowly, again.] That is certainly part of the\nemployee’s role, but an employee’s primary purpose is to become the-best-version-of-himself or\nherself.” As stated, the book title is Dream Manager. In fact, Kelly asserts that explicitly helping\npeople achieve their dreams—directly business-related or not—is a, or even the, primary task a\nboss has. The boss, to both serve her customer or get things done in general, becomes a “dream\nenabler”—e.g., works with the 28-year-old maintenance man from Ghana to achieve his dream of\na junior college degree. To repeat the chain of logic: If that 28-year-old feels wholly supported in\n68\nhis personal-growth dream, odds of his aspiring to do and doing his maintenance-man job with\nExcellence are very high.\nSo … are you?\nThat is, are you (explicitly) a “dream enabler”?\nSubsequent to the publication of The Little BIG Things, I translated the ideas of the last two\nitems—cathedrals, dream-enabling—into what I call “The Manager’s Oath”:\nOur goal is to serve our customers brilliantly and profitably over the long haul.\nServing our customers brilliantly and profitably over the long haul is a product of brilliantly\nserving over the long haul the people who serve the customer.\nHence, our job as leaders—the alpha and the omega and everything in between—is abetting the\nsustained growth and success and engagement and enthusiasm and commitment to Excellence of\nthose, one at a time, who directly or indirectly serve the ultimate customer.\nWe—leaders of every stripe—are in the “Human Growth and Development and Success and\nAspiration to Excellence” business.\n“We” [leaders-organization] only grow when “they” [each and every one of our colleagues] are\ngrowing.\n“We” [leaders-organization] only succeed when “they” [each and every one of our colleagues]\nare succeeding.\n“We” [leaders-organization] only energetically march toward Excellence when “they” [each and\nevery one of our colleagues] are energetically marching toward Excellence.\nPeriod.\n146. Launch “Project Ray.” I very rarely “dedicate” a presentation. But a while back I\nlaunched a presentation with a PowerPoint slide that read … “For Ray.” Susan and I had just\nwatched the movie Ray on DVD. And, in short: Ray Charles is the embodiment of the Spirit of\nRe-imagining!\nTime and time again he chose to Invent &#x26; Go His Own Way, to spit in the face of the sure thing,\nthe assured cash flow, the powerful advisors … and instead march in the brand new musical\ndirection his Spirit willed him to march. To be sure, the movie is an extraordinary story of\novercoming adversity, from blindness to racism to drugs to fame itself. But for me it was, above\nall, a … Matchless Tribute to the Power &#x26; Glory of Gutsy, Lonely Re-imaginings!\nWatch Ray. Consider starting a “Ray File” … or a “Re-imaginings File.” The “problem” is so easy\nto state. We’re already scoring 12-hour days—and keeping up is a nightmare. There’s no “extra\ntime” for … Project Ray! However (trust me on this one): Odds are high, very high, that if you\ncould project forward 10 years, you’d wonder why the hell there was no … Project Ray 2010.\n(Time flies.)\n(Believe it.)\n69\nWOW\n147. Realism? Not On My Watch! We recently finished a summer building project on our\nVermont farm. We did our levelheaded best to budget it correctly—getting contractors to rework\nestimates and redesigning accordingly. All that said, it looks like the carefully considered $40,000\nproject will come in at about $70,000. (Uhm, or so.)\nI decided to do a little casual research at a dinner party, asking several people about their\nhomebrew projects. Three questions:\n(1) How did you do vs. budget for projects completed a couple of years ago?\n(2) If you’d known the real price tag when you started, would you have gone ahead?\n(3) In hindsight, was the eventual price tag worth it?\nTo Q1, the answer ranged from about 5 percent over plan (if you can believe it—I’m skeptical) to\n5 times plan (which I do believe). As to Q2, four of the six I queried said “no way” would they\nhave started if they’d known what they were getting into—the other two were on the fence.\nConcerning Q3, after-the-fact satisfaction, five said, in effect, “Yes! We’d do it again”—all five of\nthose five “yups” were dogmatic. And one said “Maybe, maybe not.”\nIt’s obviously dangerous to generalize from such a tiny sample and trivial topic, but my reading of\nhistory, business, and in general, says this phenomenon is as ordinary as it gets. Furthermore, in\nthe back of one’s mind, one damn well knows that the price tag will likely be far in excess of\nwhat’s planned. And my point? Yes, you’d better have a superb number-crunching CFO, but if\nyou let him-her rule the roost, there won’t be much left to roost on. Of course I know it’s\n“Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.” On the other hand …\nProgress (ALL PROGRESS) clearly hinges on illusion and delusion!\nCherish your dreamers!\nMaster “dreamer nurturing.”\n(And also have a top-drawer CFO.)\n148. If No WOW, Then … No Go.\nDoes “it” Pop?\nDoes “it” Sparkle?”\nDoes “it” make you Grin?\nIs “it” … WOW?\nIf “it” (grand or mundane) isn’t WOW … re-do it!\nOr don’t do it!\nThis is … Your Day.\nNot “their” day.\n(I own no rose-colored glasses. Few 66-year-olds do. I have crappy days—and crappy months.\nBut I am unable, in anything I do, to be satisfied with less than the aspiration of an 8 on the 1-to10 WOW-o-meter. That’s as true for the brushcutting micro-project I do most every day in the\nsummer on my Vermont farm as it is for the speeches-for-profit … and this book. Why not\nWOW-as-”ordinary”-goal?)\n70\n149. What Makes You So Special?—Or: “Only” Beats “Best.” I guarantee that any\nreader—from anywhere, in any business—can learn something from this book: Retail Superstars:\nInside the 25 Best Independent Stores in America, by retail guru George Whalin. These are stores\nthat, literally, give new meaning to the word “special”—and “Gaspworthy” &#x26; “WOW”! That\npersonify one of my “Top 10 Favorite Quotes,” from Jerry Garcia (The Grateful Dead): “You\ndon’t want to be merely the best of the best. You want to be the only ones who do what you do.”\nWe start, naturally (!), in Fairfield, Ohio, home to Jungle Jim’s International Market. The\nadventure in “shoppertainment,” as Jungle Jim’s call it, begins in the parking lot and goes on to\n1,600 cheeses and, yes, 1,400 varieties of hot sauce—not to mention 12,000 wines priced from $8\nto $8,000 a bottle; all this is brought to you by 4,000 vendors from around the world. Like\nvirtually all the stores in this book, customers flock to the doors from every corner of the globe.\nAnd on it goes from there …\nThese stores demonstrate-prove so many things:\nYou can create a worldwide attraction and thrive as an independent in the Age of the Big Box\nretailer!\nYou can do anything!\nYou can be from anywhere!\nYou can make any-damn-thing … bizarrely-amazingly-stupendously-special!\nYes, regardless of your speciality or business unit, I will indeed … GUARANTEE … that you\ncan learn from this book.\n150. Is It “Gaspworthy”? Will your plan for addressing today’s “mundane” task make others\n“gasp” at its audacity? As an alumni of McKinsey and Co., I received an email from the firm in\n2004 about its response to the tsunami in Southeast Asia. I read it, nodded, and cast it aside. (But\ndid not “delete” for some unknown reason.) I returned to it a few hours later—and was moved to\nsend McKinsey’s managing partner an email. I said that the response was “perfectly adequate,”\nbut I added that business has a tawdry rep those/these days, and that McKinsey is viewed far and\nwide as the home of the premier Counselors to Global Top Management; so, I chided, I saw it as\na missed opportunity in that McKinsey’s response failed to … “make me gasp by its audacity.”\nForget McKinsey. The Bigger Point is that in our “responses” to tragedy and opportunity alike,\n“good enough” is a tawdry way to pass through life. How about, instead, as aspiration, my\ncobbled-together term … “gaspworthy”? So, does your response to today’s principal “chore”\nqualify for a … Medal of Certified Gaspworthiness?\n(Surely, you say, I live in the land of make believe. There’s a lot of stuff that just needs doing—\nand need not produce a “gasp.” I acknowledge that’s apparently true, and indeed the default state\nof nature. Yet The Little BIG Things is mostly dedicated to the idea of little things that aren’t in\nfact little at all—so-called “little things” that are in actual fact “gaspworthy.“)\n151. Extremism in the Defense of WOW Is No Vice. Corporations are falling like dominoes.\nChief executives are getting the axe at a record pace. Why? Incremental solutions in\ndiscontinuous times seldom if ever work. The axiom applies to a great enterprise and to a tiny\ntwo-person accountancy alike. And to me. And to you. Take a look at Tomorrow’s Calendar.\nToday’s, for that matter. Find and underscore something—anything—on that calendar that\n71\nrepresents a small step towards something extreme. Something big. Something monumental.\n(And worry like hell if there’s nothing!)\nExtremism in politics stinks.\nExtremism in business is a necessity.\nNOW\n152. Welcome to the Age of Metabolic Management. We all know the fabled race eventually\ngoes to the Tortoise. Well, times change. Google-speed or Alibaba-speed is the new limit (until\nthe record is broken, which it will be soon enough), and we are now officially living in the Age of\nthe Hare. As Larry Light, McDonald’s Global Chief Marketing Officer, put it in Advertising Age:\n“Today, you own ideas for about an hour and a half.”\nMy “moniker” for dealing with and thriving in the Age of the Hare is … Metabolic Management.\nI believe it’s one of the boss’s … prime tasks … to Purposefully and Consciously and Perpetually\nwork on Accelerating the Corporate (project team, etc.) Metabolism. Some thoughts:\n• Exhibit personal urgency … hourly-daily-consciously.\n• Hire for it. (My car dealer pal Carl Sewell said he looks for antsy people “who literally\ncan’t sit still” during an interview. One well-known headhunter takes candidates to lunch\nin the city—and frowns if they don’t jaywalk.)\n• Promote it.\n• Reward it. (“Speed Demon of the Week” recognition at the Monday Morning Huddle.)\n• Set aggressive targets—forget “incrementalism,” go after a 75% or 95% or 98%\nreduction in the time it takes to do X or Y or Z. (Bold targets inspire—and are indeed\npossible on the speed front. In fact, I suggest something like never accepting a “speed up”\nsuggestion of less than 50%.)\nEtc. …\n153. Walls of “Yesterday.” Walls of “Tomorrow.”\nWhat do your walls look like?\nDo they look like “yesterday”?\nOr do they look like “tomorrow”?\nYesterday = Plaques from past awards and group pictures from past parties. Etc. Etc.\nTomorrow = Work-in-Progress pictures for ongoing projects. Interesting press clips on new\nproducts just launched. Customers landed or vendors signed up in the last 30 days. Six new hires\nin the last 30 days. Etc. Etc.\n(This idea is de facto stolen from Steve Jobs. When he returned to Apple from the wilderness in\n1997, one of his first acts was to remove all traces of old glory from his office and Apple facilities\nin general. He felt the product line he inherited was un-scintillating, and wanted the affect of the\nplace to reflect work in progress, not icons of yesteryear.)\n72\n154. Pissing Away Your Life: Like It or Not, Work Is Life! Some say I use words like\n“Wow” too much. “You damn well can’t,” they say, “turn every ‘day at the office’ into some\n‘Adventure in EXCELLENCE.‘”\nWell, “they” have a point—to a point.\nBut it ain’t much of a point.\nLet me be crude, rude, and short but not sweet: By the time you’re nearing 30, let’s say, the stayup-every-night-‘til-2 a.m. era is pretty much behind you. So, let’s say you awaken on average at\n6:30 a.m. … and turn in around 11 p.m. (More or less.) That’s 16.5 waking hours—call it 17. You\njust plain lose, say, two hours a day—a little over one hour on your 2-way commute, and 45\nminutes on whatever. So now we’re at 15 “usable” hours.\nSuppose your ordinary workday is 8:15 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.—that seems about right to me. (I’m not\nciting research here, other than years and years of casual observation.) So the work day amounts\nto 9.25 hours.\nWhich is to say, you are spending, Monday through Friday, about 9.75/15ths … or roughly twothirds … of your usable hours at work. Which in turn means … If you piss away your work time,\nyou’re pissing away well over half your “conscious” “life.”\nIMPACT\n155. Forget Longevity—Think “Dramatic Frenzy.” I occasionally speed-walk while\nlistening to one or another of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.’s speeches. One of the most\nextraordinary took place in Memphis, immediately before Dr. King was assassinated. In it, he\nanticipates the tragic event:\n“Well, I don’t know what will happen now. We’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn’t\nmatter with me now. Because I’ve been on the mountain-top. And I don’t mind. Like anybody, I\nwould like to live a long life. Longevity has its place, but I’m not concerned about that now. I just\nwant to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve\nseen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as\na people, will get to the Promised Land. And I’m happy, tonight. I’m not worried about anything.\nI’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.”\nI get chills … again … as I write this. I am loath to trivialize Dr. King’s remarks in any way, but I\ndo want to make a “business” point: “Longevity has its place, but I’m not concerned about that\nnow …”\nI simply don’t buy “built to last” in any way, shape or form—and this passage reinforced my\nabiding belief. “Built to Impact” is/has been/will be my Rallying Cry. Dr. King changed the\nworld—and died at 39. To continue the trivializing, here’s my business translation of Dr. King’s\nwords: I’ve often said that Netscape is/was my favorite company in recent years—it was born,\nchanged the world and died, at about age 6. Kjell Nordström and Jonas Ridderstråle make this\npoint particularly well in Funky Business: “But what if [former head of strategic planning at\nRoyal Dutch Shell] Arie De Geus is wrong in suggesting, in The Living Company, that firms\nshould aspire to live forever? Greatness is fleeting and, for corporations, it will become ever more\nfleeting. The ultimate aim of a business organization, an artist, an athlete, or a stockbroker may\n73\nbe to … explode in a dramatic frenzy of value creation during a short space of time, rather than\nlive forever.”\nProgress, to my mind, and doubtless significantly influenced by a quarter-century’s residence in\nSilicon Valley, is a series of such explosions—many, many duds and a few, like Apple or\nNetscape or Google, that change the world. “Long-term” success? If I thought of myself as\nchoosing, in the early ’90s, a working future based on retrospective knowledge, I’d put in the\nyears of, say, 1994–1998 at Netscape over any damned alternate you can name!\n156. How About Replacing Your “Wish It Were” List with a “Do It Now” List?\n“I can’t wait until Spring.”\n“I can’t wait until Football season!”\n“I can’t wait until I’ve finished preparing this damn presentation.”\n“I can’t wait until So-and-So makes up his mind, so that we can get moving.”\nOne does, reasonably, wish the surgery were over, that final exams were past, that their daughter\nwould get back from Iraq. Nonetheless, and I’m no Zen practitioner, the goal, as in the goal, is\nalways, as in always, to make the absolute most of the moment—because, to state the obvious but\noften ignored-in-practice truism, the moment, this moment, is the only-damn-thing we ever have.\nSo: How are you going to get past the “wish-it-weres,” and make the next, yes, meeting, the next\n15 minutes special, and fully participate therein? (PLEASE ASK YOURSELF THAT\nQUESTION. RIGHT NOW.)\nSPECIAL SECTION: The Heart of Business Strategy\nWe usually think of business strategy as some sort of aspirational market positioning statement.\nDoubtless that’s part of it. But I believe that the number one “strategic strength” is excellence in\nexecution and systemic relationships (i.e., with everyone we come in contact with). Hence I offer,\nin shorthand form here, the following 47 pieces of advice in creating a winning “strategy” that is\ninherently sustainable.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>“Thank you.” Minimum several times a day. Measure it.</li>\n<li>“Thank you” to everyone even peripherally involved in some activity—especially</li>\n</ol>\n<p>those “deep in the hierarchy.”\n3. Smile. Work on it.\n4. Apologize. Even if “they” are “mostly” to blame.\n5. Jump all over (eventually release) those who play the “blame game.”\n6. Hire enthusiasm.\n7. Low enthusiasm. No hire. Any job.\n8. Hire optimists. Everywhere. (“Positive outlook on life,” not mindless optimism.)\n9. Hiring: Would you like to go to lunch with him-her? 100% of jobs.\n10. Hire for good manners.\n11. Do not reject “trouble makers”—that is, those who are uncomfortable with the status\nquo. (Source of … ALL … innovation.)\n12. Hire for demonstrated resilience.\n13. Overwhelming/dis-proportionate response to even the smallest screwups.\n14. Become a student of all you will meet with. Big time.\n15. Hang out with interesting new people. Measure it. (You = Those you hang out with.)\n74\n16. Lunch with folks in other functions. Measure it. (220 opportunities/year.)\n17. Listen. Hear. Become a serious “professional”/student of listening-hearing.\n18. Work on everyone’s listening skills. Practice.\n19. Become a student of information extraction-interviewing.\n20. Become a professional/student of presentation giving.\n21. Incredible care in 1st line supervisor selection and development. Measure it.\n22. World’s best training for 1st line supervisors.\n23. Construct small leadership opportunities for junior people within days of starting on\nthe job.\n24. Insane care in all promotion decisions.\n25. Promote “people people” for all managerial jobs. Finance-logistics-R&#x26;D as much as,\nsay, sales.\n26. Hire-promote for demonstrated curiosity. Check their past commitment to continuous\nlearning.\n27. Small “d” diversity. Rich mixes for any and all teams.\n28. Hire women. Roughly 50% women on exec team. (Or more, depending on market.)\n29. Exec team “looks like” customer population, actual and desired.\n30. Focus on creating products for and selling to women.\n31. Focus on creating products for and selling to boomers-geezers.\n32. Work on first and last impressions. (100% contacts = “WOW” experiences.)\n33. Walls display tomorrow’s aspirations, not yesterday’s accomplishments.\n34. Simplify systems. Constantly. (Not “systems,” but “beautiful systems”!)\n35. Insist that almost all material be covered by a 1-page summary. Absolutely no longer.\n36. Practice decency.\n37. Add “We are thoughtful in all we do” to corporate values list—#1 force for\ncustomer loyalty, employee satisfaction.\n38. Make headlong employee growth (for all) a formal part of values set. Above\ncustomer satisfaction. Steal from RE/MAX: “We are a life success company.”\n39. Flowers.\n40. Celebrate “small wins.” Often. Perhaps a “small win of the day.”\n41. Manage your calendar religiously: Does it accurately reflect your espoused priorities?\nUse a “calendar friend” who’s not very friendly to help you with this.\n42. Review your calendar: Work assiduously and mercilessly on your “To don’ts.”\n43. Bosses: Formally cultivate one advisor whose role is to tell you the truth.\n44. Commit to Excellence.\n45. Talk up Excellence.\n46. Put “Excellence in all we do” in the values set.\n47. Measure everyone on demonstrated commitment to Excellence.\nSUCCESS\n157. The “3H Model” of Success.\nThe 3H’s:\nHoward.\nHilton.\nHerb.\n75\n(1) Starbucks has hit a rough patch, but as “they” say, we should all have Howard Schultz’s\nproblems—a guy who took a cup of java and grew a business of over 10,000 iconic shops\nworldwide. There is no doubt that to run an international show as big as Starbucks is quite a\nchore, and the staff is tops, and there’s data by the ton. Yet the boss, Mr. Schultz, aims (and\nusually succeeds) to visit—hold on to your hat—25 shops per week. He believes you’ve gotta see\nthe real deal up close with all your senses (after all, Starbucks sells an all-senses “experience”) to\nknow the score.\n(2) If there’s ever been a more prominent and successful hotelier than Conrad Hilton, I’d like to\nknow who it is. One Hilton anecdote: The story goes that at the conclusion of a gala honoring his\ncareer, Mr. Hilton was finally called to the podium to “share his success secrets.” He made his\nway to the front of the house, and intoned … “Remember to tuck the shower curtain inside the\nbathtub.” And that was it, and back he went to his seat.\n(3) In 2009, American Airlines and the Southwest Airlines held their annual meetings on the\nsame day in Dallas, headquarters to both. APA, the Allied Pilots Association, picketed\nAmerican’s meeting. The Southwest meeting marked founder Herb Kelleher’s retirement after 37\nyears. Like Mr. Hilton, Herb was asked to reveal his full set of secrets, and, like Mr. Hilton, he\nseverely limited his remarks: “You have to treat your employees like customers.” (Whoops, I\nforgot to mention that on the same day the APA picketed American, Southwest’s pilots’ union\npaid a small fortune to take out full-page ads in the likes of USA Today thanking Herb for his\nyears of service—and support of the union and its pilots. Quite a contrast, eh?)\nBottom line from the 3Hs:\n(1) Stay in touch! (Howard)\n(2) Sweat the details! (Hilton)\n(3) People first! (Herb)\nPretty close to an “all you need to know” recitation.\n158. A 5-Word, 5-Point “Complete” “Excellence Manifesto.” Here goes, my “summary of\neverything” … in five words:\nCause.\nSpace.\nDecency.\nService.\nExcellence.\nCause: An objective worthy of our commitment. An aim that supersedes the need for an alarm\nclock and that we can brag about to our friends, our family, and our mirror.\nSpace: Room to roam. Constant and insistent encouragement for taking the initiative. An\nexpectation that everyone will perceive herself or himself as a Change Agent-Entrepreneur.\nDecency: Thoughtfulness to a fault in everything we do. Fairness to a fault in everything we do.\nSky-high respect for every person with whom we come in contact.\nService: We unfailingly aim to “be of service.” Our leaders at all levels are “in service” to their\nstaff. Each staff member is “in service” to her or his peers and internal and external customers.\n76\nExcellence: Our ultimate aim is always … Excellence. Nothing less. In our treatment of one\nanother. In the products and services we develop. In our relationships with customers-vendorscommunity.\n“How are you doing” I: How are you doing on each point in general?\n“How are you doing” II: How have you done on each of the five … TODAY?\n159. The Full Nelson—Or: 13 Lessons on “Navigating” Excellence. Lord Horatio Nelson,\nan old Navy man and avid student of naval history, to me epitomizes Excellence. And, near the\n200th anniversary of his singular victory at Trafalgar, I happened upon a new biography (I’ve\nprobably ingested a dozen over the years), Andrew Lambert’s Nelson: Britannia’s God of War.\nFrom it, I extracted 13 lessons that I contend are mostly applicable to you and me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Simple scheme. Nelson’s orders of battle were paragons of simplicity and clarity—he was a</li>\n</ol>\n<p>damn good writer among other things. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)\n2. Soaring/Bold/Noble Purpose! Nelson pursued total victory. Many of his peers were willing,\nessentially, to rate surviving as victory enough. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)\n3. Engage others. Nelson made his captains full partners in the process as he devised plans—\nunheard of in those days. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)\n4. Find great talent, at any age, let it soar! Nelson gave his best captains, young or old, far more\nleeway than his counterpart admirals—and he eschewed seniority as primary measure of assigned\nresponsibility. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)\n5. Lead by Love! The sailors, every biographer agrees, loved Nelson, and he them. (Last clause in\nthe sentence is crucial.) His concern for their well-being, regardless of the rough nature of the\nsailor’s life in those days, was legendary. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)\n6. Seize the Moment! Nelson’s sixth sense about enemy weakness was remarkable. He would skip\nto “Plan B” in a flash if merited by changing circumstances. (Doable for you or me? Yes. More or\nless—“good instincts” are the indirect product of insanely hard work.)\n7. Vigor! His energy was palpable! (Doable for you or me? Yes. Mostly. Low energy folks aren’t\npicks for leadership positions—or any other positions, for that matter.)\n8. Master your craft. Nelson was the best damn sailor in the Navy—sailors and officers\nappreciated that beyond measure. (Doable for you or me? Yes. Damn it. We are not all created\nequal—but often “the best” is not the one who tops the charts on raw talent.)\n9. Work harder-harder-harder than the next person. No explanation needed. (Doable for you or\nme? Yes.)\n10. Show the way, walk the talk, exude confidence! Start a Passion Epidemic! Nelson led from\nthe front—visible, in full dress uniform as the cannons roared. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)\n11. Change the rules: Create your own game! Nelson always took the initiative—thus forcing\nrivals, from the beginning and throughout maneuvering at battle, to be in a full-time reactive\nmode. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)\n12. Luck! Believe it! Always necessary! Not “desirable”—but necessary. (Doable for you or me?\nAnybody can get lucky—and preparedness ups the odds of getting lucky. But, truthfully, lucky is\nlucky.)\n13. Be determined to come out on top, come hell or/and high water! Lambert:\n“Other Admirals were more frightened of losing than anxious to win.” This last is a big deal—it\nbelongs as either #1 or #13. (Doable for you or me? Yes.)\n77\n160. A Cheat Sheet for Tough Times. (and Other Times, Too.) Amid all of the advice “out\nthere” on dealing with difficult circumstances, how do you … boil it all down? Some thoughts:\n(1) Be conscious in the Zen sense. Carefully consider, far more than you normally might,\nhow you project: Does your “energetic” approach, for example, look more like panic? Is\nyour smile in place—nothing is amusing about tough economic times, but a permanently\ngrim demeanor, even if it’s merited, is a guaranteed de-motivator. Etc.\n(2) Meet … daily, first thing … with your leadership team—to discuss whatever, check\nassumptions. Perhaps meet again late afternoon. Meetings max 30 minutes, maybe 15.\n(3) If you are a “big boss,” use a 100-percent trusted, private sounding board—check in\ndaily, whether you “need to” … or not.\n(4) Concoct scenarios by the bushel, test ‘em, play with ‘em, short-term, long-term, sane,\ninsane. (Not necessarily a formal exercise—but a constant “playful” exercise.)\n(5) MBWA (Manage by Wandering Around). Wander. Sample attitudes. Visible but not\nfrenzied. But visible … visible … visible.\n(6) Work the phones, chat up experts, non-experts, customers, vendors. Seek enormous\ndiversity of opinion. (NB: Big bosses invariably spend too much time with “experts”!\nExpert = Blinders = Particularly bad in uncertain/ambiguous times.)\n(7) “Over”communicate!!!!!\n(8) Exercise—encourage your leadership team to double up on their physical exercise;\nphysical sharpness is insanely important to mental evenness.\n(9) Underscore “EXCELLENCE in every transaction”! (Now, more than ever!)\n“BIG”</p>\n<ol start=\"161\">\n<li>Retirement Sucks. My college fraternity brothers have a wonderful ritual: an annual</li>\n</ol>\n<p>newsletter that we all contribute to. A few years back (I was 62 at the time), I vented about the\ntopic of “retirement”: “You’ve all doubtless heard the Churchill yarn. The old man was transiting\nthe Atlantic by ship. An aide made a mental calculation and turned to WSC, ‘Sir Winston, I’ve\ncalculated how much brandy you’ve drunk. It comes to about here,’ he said, pointing to a spot\nabout halfway up the wall of the cavernous ballroom in which they were seated. WSC leaned in\ntoward the chap, pointed to his de facto marker on the wall, and purportedly said, ‘So little time,\nso much to do.’\n“I am often tired (I’m 62, not 22), but I Love &#x26; Appreciate the Opportunities I’ve been granted to\ntake part in the Universal Dialogue about the Meaning of Work &#x26; Life &#x26; National Purpose.\n“PUT SIMPLY, ‘RETIREMENT’ TO ME MEANS BEING DRAGGED OFF A STAGE AND\nSLIPPED INTO A SIMPLE PINE BOX INSCRIBED WITH THESE WORDS: ‘HE GAVE A\nSHIT.‘”\n162. Think Legacy!</p>\n<p>“My life is my message.”—Gandhi\nLEGACY!\nIt can be a beautiful word!\n(Why I mattered.)\n(What I left behind that lasted.)\n78\nBut I urge you also to think of it as a continuous goal. Consider your current assignment as head\nof a 7-person branch in an IS/IT department. (Or whatever.) Suppose you move on in 6 or 12 or\n18 (or 21) months: WHAT … ONE SENTENCE … WILL SUMMARIZE YOUR “TERM”?\nReal bedrock: I believe a Single Day can have as much of a “legacy” as a lifetime. In fact, that\nhad better be the case! Why? Because this day … stretching out before me … is filled (at the\nmoment) with limitless opportunities … and it is … ALL I HAVE!\nRight?\nJust another day?\nHardly!\nTHIS IS … IT!\n163. Don’t Forget Why You’re Here! Peggy Noonan, “A Life’s Lesson,” on the astounding\nresponse to the passing of Tim Russert, the Wall Street Journal, June 21-22, 2008:\n“In a way, the world is a great liar. It shows you it worships and admires money, but at the end of\nthe day it doesn’t. It says it adores fame and celebrity, but it doesn’t, not really. The world\nadmires, and wants to hold on to, and not lose, goodness. It admires virtue. At the end it gives its\ngreatest tributes to generosity, honesty, courage, mercy, talents well used, talents that, brought\ninto the world, make it better. That’s what it really admires. That’s what we talk about in eulogies,\nbecause that’s what’s important. We don’t say, ‘The thing about Joe was he was rich!’ We say, if\nwe can, ‘The thing about Joe was he took good care of people.‘”\nI wish you a long life, but if tragedy were to have struck you yesterday, what do you think “they”\nmight say at your memorial service? This maudlin question is not to be dwelt on “24/7,” but it is\nworth considering on an irregularly regular basis.\nAmen.\nAnd good luck.</p>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us.

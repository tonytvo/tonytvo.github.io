They compound.” – James Clear</li>\n<li>Habits are really about identity change. Behaviour change is simply the means to get there (feedback loop).</li>\n<li>The reward that closes the habit loop is often the satisfaction of the craving. We don’t desire external behaviour. We want the sensations that come with it.</li>\n<li>Stop trying to be a hero. (“Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behaviour.” – James Clear)</li>\n<li>The goal is not to fill your day with meaningless lifehacks. Focus on the big rocks and learn to embody your values/identity with small wins. “Standardize before you optimize” – James Clear</li>\n<li>“Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard.” – James Clear</li>\n<li>Focus on the decisive moments. Which habit/decision has a domino effect on the rest of your day?</li>\n<li>Track process metrics over outcome metrics. We can’t control the outcomes. Identify with showing up.</li>\n<li>Commitment devices are a powerful tool when combined with social accountability. Design your social environment.</li>\n<li>“Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work on.” – James Clear</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"why-tiny-changes-make-a-big-difference\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-tiny-changes-make-a-big-difference\" aria-label=\"why tiny changes make a big difference permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference</h1>\n<h2 id=\"the-surprising-power-of-atomic-habits\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-surprising-power-of-atomic-habits\" aria-label=\"the surprising power of atomic habits permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Small deviations expand with time.\n<ul>\n<li>A plane off by 3.5 degrees when it takes flight results in hundreds of miles of error.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>“Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.” – James Clear</li>\n<li>Progress is like an ice cube sitting in a warming cold room.\n<ul>\n<li>The overnight success takes 10 years of build-up.</li>\n<li>Cancer spends 80% of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months.</li>\n<li>Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years (roots) before exploding 90 feet into the air within six weeks.</li>\n<li>“Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored.” – James Clear</li>\n<li>San Antonio Spurs locker room quote\n<ul>\n<li>stonecutter hammering 100 times with nothing.

It’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about achieving external measures of success like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone. - JAMES CLEAR</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aliabdaal.com/book-notes/die-with-zero/\">https://aliabdaal.com/book-notes/die-with-zero/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.debtfreedr.com/die-with-zero-summary/\">https://www.debtfreedr.com/die-with-zero-summary/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://duddhawork.com/blog/die-with-zero-book-notes/\">https://duddhawork.com/blog/die-with-zero-book-notes/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://duddhawork.com/blog/die-with-zero-implementation/\">https://duddhawork.com/blog/die-with-zero-implementation/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@amyduval92/summary-of-best-seller-die-with-zero-by-bill-perkins-a3b70d56ecb8\">https://medium.com/@amyduval92/summary-of-best-seller-die-with-zero-by-bill-perkins-a3b70d56ecb8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.clearwhitespace.com/post/die-with-zero-book-summary\">https://www.clearwhitespace.com/post/die-with-zero-book-summary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://public.summaries.com/files/1-page-summary/die-with-zero.pdf\">https://public.summaries.com/files/1-page-summary/die-with-zero.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://synapsetrading.com/die-with-zero/\">https://synapsetrading.com/die-with-zero/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://growthabit.com/business-finance-books/die-with-zero-book-summary-review-notes/\">https://growthabit.com/business-finance-books/die-with-zero-book-summary-review-notes/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thunknotes.com/blog/a-visual-book-summary-of-atomic-habits-by-james-clear\">https://www.thunknotes.com/blog/a-visual-book-summary-of-atomic-habits-by-james-clear</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://srinathramakrishnan.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/brief-summary-of-atomic-habits.pdf\">https://srinathramakrishnan.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/brief-summary-of-atomic-habits.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aprabaswara.medium.com/book-summary-atomic-habits-by-james-clear-c627a1552e38\">https://aprabaswara.medium.com/book-summary-atomic-habits-by-james-clear-c627a1552e38</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nateliason.com/notes/atomic-habits-james-clear\">https://www.nateliason.com/notes/atomic-habits-james-clear</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dansilvestre.com/summaries/atomic-habits-james-clear/\">https://dansilvestre.com/summaries/atomic-habits-james-clear/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theprocesshacker.com/blog/atomic-habits-james-clear-book-summary/\">https://theprocesshacker.com/blog/atomic-habits-james-clear-book-summary/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tylerdevries.com/book-summaries/atomic-habits/\">https://tylerdevries.com/book-summaries/atomic-habits/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/atomic-habits/\">https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/atomic-habits/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://duddhawork.com/blog/atomic-habits/\">https://duddhawork.com/blog/atomic-habits/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Atomic Habits by James Clear summary","date":"March 30, 2024","description":"Atomic Habits by James Clear summary"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/effective-typescript/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"effective typescript summary"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"1a77b521-3729-599b-8d7b-a93b0e31adce","previousPostId":"d47c4fd6-848a-52d1-b586-682b50a0508e","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}

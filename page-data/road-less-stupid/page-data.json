I don’t need to do more smart things. I just need to do fewer dumb things. I need to avoid making emotional decisions and swinging at bad pitches. I need to think!</li>\n<li>All my problems started out as a good idea, and all those “good” ideas were emotionally justifiable at the time. Not only that, my current financial condition represents my very best “thinking.” Yours does, too.</li>\n<li>What sabotages our dreams and causes most of our problems (and ensuing dumb tax) is our excessive optimism and emotional belief in magic pills, secret formulas, and financial tooth fairies. (All balloons look good when they are filled with hot air.) Dumb!</li>\n<li>Emotions and intellect work inversely. When emotions go up, intellect goes down. Optimism is a deadly emotion in the business world. Warren Buffett said it best: “Optimism is the enemy of the rational investor.”</li>\n<li>There are no secrets … just stuff you haven’t learned yet.</li>\n<li>A business owner must knows that building a business is 80% an intellectual sport. Just like the great book by Napoleon hill says; Think and Grow Rich. Thinking is very essential to business growth. He who thinks deeper and wider wins the game. I dare say that Critical thinking is the name of the game. So where I am today is a product of my thinking or better still I am a product of how critical I think and analyze situations to make a decision. So every decision I make must take into consideration 2nd, 3rd and 4th order consequences when taking business decisions.</li>\n<li>John Maynard Keyes astutely said, “Most people, when confronted with a choice of changing their thoughts or proving there is no need to change, get busy on the proof.” I am so guilty of this. Whenever I have a knack or feeling that an idea would work, I would rather go ahead and find proof that it would work instead of looking at all the sides critically.</li>\n<li>“More often than not, critically thinking about what could go wrong and doing the work to mitigate those risks before taking action is abandoned in favor of comfort zones, the path of least resistance, and speed (instant gratification).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-discipline-of-thinking-time\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-discipline-of-thinking-time\" aria-label=\"the discipline of thinking time permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE DISCIPLINE OF THINKING TIME</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>There’s no such thing as natural business owner</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hard work trumps natural talent: Like the world renowned scientist, Albert Einstein said that being a genius is 99% hard work and 1% inspiration. You need to put in the necessary hard work before you get any result at all. Just like Keith put it so beautifully; Great business owners work hard, practice, study, test, think, correct and practice some more. There is no short cut. Period!! You must be committed to excellence and seek ways to do things better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>attempting to win the game of business by trial and error is about the stupidest way to learn anything</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never wing it: Most of us try to do this and hope that it will click, stick or have result. The issue with this is that it hardly succeeds and if it does you cannot repeat the process because you don’t have successive steps to show for it. So it’s not duplicable. Why would you do things by trial and error that would, in most times cost, you more in the long run, as opposed to take the necessary time to put into quality thinking to make better nosiness decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>running the wrong direction enthusiastically is stupid</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>it does no good to practice the wrong thing. To excel you must get a coach or advisor that will watch very move you are making and then give advice on the right direction to take, because running in the wrong direction enthusiastically is just plain stupid. Please note that this coach or advisor must have succeeded in his own endeavor. In other words, been there done that.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If you want to do better, you must get better:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>people do not do better because <em>they want to do better</em>; they do better because they <em>get better</em>. You cannot achieve a new outcome without learning something new and practicing what you learned (probably outside your comfort zone). A commitment to mastery (improving) is essential for excellence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>the people with the best life have the best choices</strong> people with a lousy life have lousy choices. If I want to improve my life, I need to create better choices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you will pay dumb tax if you ignore these principles or you will pay to fix the problem. Either way, you are writing a check.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>the road less stupid</em> is designed to accomplish 2 primary objectives</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide a structure/process/skill set to enable you to create successful Thinking Time ritual that, if applied, will result in a significantly reduced dumb tax.</li>\n<li>suggest a series of possible Thinking Time topics and questions you can use to spark your thinking, grow your business, make more money and ultimately avoid doing something stupid.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-5-core-disciplines-of-thinking\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-5-core-disciplines-of-thinking\" aria-label=\"the 5 core disciplines of thinking permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE 5 CORE DISCIPLINES OF THINKING</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Find the Unasked Question</strong>-Create a question that will result in clarity and generate better choices.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Another thing to note in the way the question is framed. It must be framed in such a way that engenders possible solutions or available improvements to the solution. Otherwise it’s a mere predicament or a statement. So if you must craft a problem, use this “How might I…so that I can…? This rule or guide line provides insight on how to remedy the situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you think of what needs to be broken versus what needs to be fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three characteristics that a carefully crafted question does are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides insight on what the actual problem is</li>\n<li>Simplify the problem and make it solvable</li>\n<li>Expand the number of possibilities available to solve the problem at hand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having the right answer is smart. Having the right question is genius. Or, as Peter Drucker said, “Most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The truly  dangerous thing is asking the wrong question.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>all problems are solvable (or at a minimum can be addressed so that we improve our situation). Our job as business owners and leadership teams is to get clarity on the right question to ask before we pull the trigger. We would all have better answers and more choices if we invested the time to design better questions and then actually allocated some Thinking Time to consider them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separate the Problem from the Symptom</strong> — Identify the real obstacle that is blocking my progress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The key to defining the root problem is discovering the obstacle (it resides in the gap) that is impeding your progress from here to there. It is the obstacle that is the problem, not the dissatisfaction with your current circumstances!</strong></li>\n<li>Most times when I look back at some of the mistakes we made as a company I realized that the problem wasn’t clearly articulated or it was a wrong statement of problem. I would usually wonder why we don’t have enough sales, why we don’t have enough customers, low profits, difficulty in finding quality staff, keeping quality staff etc. These are questions that are always on our mind as business owners.</li>\n<li>These questions are very valid but ultimately these questions are not the problems that exists but are rather the symptoms of a problem. We realized that we pointed out our biggest problems as the gaps between where we were and where we would like to be.</li>\n<li>The symptom is the gap while the problem is the obstacle.</li>\n<li>there are 2 fundamental difficulties with a misdiagnosis of root problem (or mislabeling the symptom as the obstacle)\n<ul>\n<li>the questions you ask and the solutions you find are usually tactical</li>\n<li>when the machines are constructed and deployed to address the symptom (but not the root problem, obstacle), resources are wasted and there is zero sustainable forward progress toward the desired outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the 3 most fundamental questions to ask to help get clarity about the root problem/obstacle are:\n<ul>\n<li>what are the possible reasons I’m noticing this symptom?</li>\n<li>what isn’t happening that, if it did happen, would cause the perceived gap (symptoms) to either narrow or disappear?</li>\n<li>what’s happening that, if it stopped happening, would cause the perceived gap (symptoms) to narrow or disappear.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Building a machine for the problem that isn’t and expecting forward progress is delusional.</li>\n<li>If we misdiagnose or mislabel the problem, we will gravitate toward designing solutions and building machines for the symptoms (aka “the problem that isn’t”) and this is a prescription for frustration and failure.</li>\n<li>Few things are worse than running the wrong direction enthusiastically. Misdiagnosing the problem or working on the wrong priorities results in a dumb tax!</li>\n<li>sustainable forward progress (aka “Kicking the Can”) is only possible by identifying\n<ul>\n<li>exactly where I am (Point A)</li>\n<li>exactly where the can is</li>\n<li>exactly where the goal line is in relation to me and the can (Point B) and</li>\n<li>then overcoming the specific obstacle preventing the can from crossing the goal line.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Check Assumptions</strong> - Differentiate the facts from the story I am spinning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What none of us see are the assumptions we make about the problem we have, the solution we create, or the opportunity in front of us. The reality is that virtually all my dumb tax could have been avoided if I had just questioned a couple of obvious assumptions prior to pulling the trigger.</li>\n<li><strong>what don’t I see</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>what I don’t see is what costs me money</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Buffet’s respond to $20 dollar bet:\n<ul>\n<li>if \"\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consider 2nd-Order Consequences-Clarify the risks and the possibility/cost of being wrong.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create the Machine-Create the executable plan and identify the resources (people and money) required to solve the real (core) problem and make forward progress.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stupid in small things, stupid in big things.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We only have a choice about the decision we are about to make, not the consequences. An important decision that does not identify the possible risks as well as the probability and costs of failure is a decision with a high likelihood of creating drama. The problem with drama is that it always costs money.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Risks don’t cease to exist just because you ignore them, and neither do facts. An honest assessment of what could go wrong, the probability of it going off the rails, and the cost in the event of failure are fundamental to minimizing your dumb tax.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thinking about 2nd-order consequences minimizes the probability of a double bogey. Mistakes are inevitable, but double bogeys are usually avoidable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shoes that don’t fit are not a bargain at any price. A good idea that can’t be executed is a bad idea.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>. Ultimately, the problem gets addressed or solved as\na result of a machine that will move me from Point\nA (where I am) to Point B (where I want to go). The\nexpectation is that the new machine will produce an\noutput that improves my situation, closes the gap, and\nmoves me closer to the desired outcome.\n• Regardless of the change, management must shift\npriorities if the new solution has a shot at being effective.\nChanges in priorities are always accompanied by changes\nin the allocation of resources. The vast majority of\nsolutions (machines) fail to produce the anticipated\noutcomes because management is unclear about the\nrequired shifts in focus, human capital, and money.\n• Measurement is THE key to sustainability and a culture\nof accountability.\nTHINKING TIME: THE PROCESS\n• Designing a Thinking Time process that works for you\nwill be no different than figuring out any other ritual you\nwant to create. The time of day, the best location, and the\noptimum duration are all discovered through practice\nand experimentation until you have created a Thinking\nTime process that best supports your outcomes. The key\nhere is to obsess about obtaining the outcomes and not\nabout finding the perfect process!\n• Fundamentally, Thinking Time is a structured process\nthat enables me to minimize the risks, identify the\nopportunities, and maximize the results. That is a pretty\nhigh return for a very low-cost investment.\nMMM… KOOL-AID\n• Learning doesn’t happen until something changes.\n• Business is complex and the future is unknown. Tactical\nsolutions, simplistic formulas, and generalized answers\ntend to cripple rather than enhance success. No one\nhas all the answers and nobody can predict the future,\nincluding me. Whatever you do, don’t drink my Kool-Aid,\neither. On the other hand, don’t ignore what I’m saying.\nDo some independent thinking for a change. Just because\nsomeone has written a book doesn’t mean he knows what\nhe’s talking about. The same holds true for me.\n• Be careful who you take advice from. Are they really an\nexpert, or just someone with an opinion and a publisher?</p>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>Operators react and sweat.

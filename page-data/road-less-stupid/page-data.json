I don’t need to do more intelligent things. I need to do fewer dumb things. I need to avoid making emotional decisions and swinging at bad pitches. I need to think!</li>\n<li>All my problems started as a good idea, and all those “good” ideas were emotionally justifiable. Also, my current financial condition represents my very best “thinking.” Yours does, too.</li>\n<li>What sabotages our dreams and causes most of our problems (and the ensuing dumb tax) is our excessive optimism and emotional belief in magic pills, secret formulas, and financial tooth fairies. (All balloons look good when they are filled with hot air.) Dumb!</li>\n<li>Emotions and intellect work inversely. When emotions go up, intellect goes down. Optimism is a deadly emotion in the business world. Warren Buffett said it best: “Optimism is the enemy of the rational investor.”</li>\n<li>There are no secrets … just stuff you haven’t learned yet.</li>\n<li>A business owner must know that building a business is 80% an intellectual sport. Just like the excellent book by Napoleon Hill says; Think and Grow Rich. Thinking is essential to business growth. He who thinks deeper and wider wins the game. I dare say that Critical thinking is the name of the game. So where I am today is a product of my thinking or, better still, a product of how critical I think and analyze situations to make a decision. So every decision I make must consider 2nd, 3rd and 4th order consequences when making business decisions.</li>\n<li>John Maynard Keyes astutely said, “Most people, when confronted with a choice of changing their thoughts or proving there is no need to change, get busy on the proof.” I am so guilty of this. Whenever I have a knack or feeling that an idea would work, I would find proof that it would work instead of looking at all the sides critically.</li>\n<li>“More often than not, critically thinking about what could go wrong and doing the work to mitigate those risks before taking action is abandoned in favour of comfort zones, the path of least resistance, and speed (instant gratification).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-discipline-of-thinking-time\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-discipline-of-thinking-time\" aria-label=\"the discipline of thinking time permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE DISCIPLINE OF THINKING TIME</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>There’s no such thing as a natural business owner</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hard work trumps natural talent: Like the world-renowned scientist, Albert Einstein said that geniuses are 99% hard work and 1% inspiration. You need to put in the necessary hard work before getting any results. Like Keith put it so beautifully; Great business owners work hard, practice, study, test, think, correct and practice some more. There is no shortcut. Period!! You must be committed to excellence and seek ways to do things better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>attempting to win the game of business by trial and error is about the stupidest way to learn anything</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never wing it: Most of us try to do this and hope it will click, stick or have a result. The issue with this is that it hardly succeeds and if it does you cannot repeat the process because you don’t have successive steps to show for it. So it’s not duplicable. Why would you do things by trial and error that would, most times cost, you more in the long run, as opposed to taking the necessary time to put into quality thinking to make better nosiness decisions?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>running in the wrong direction enthusiastically is stupid</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>it does no good to practice the wrong thing. To excel you must get a coach or advisor that will watch every move you are making and then give advice on the right direction to take because running in the wrong direction enthusiastically is just plain stupid. Please note that this coach or advisor must have succeeded in his endeavour. In other words, been there done that.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If you want to do better, you must get better:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>people do not do better because <em>they want to do better</em>; they do better because they <em>get better</em>. You cannot achieve a new outcome without learning something new and practicing what you learned (probably outside your comfort zone). A commitment to mastery (improving) is essential for excellence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The people with the best life have the best choices</strong> People with a lousy life have lousy choices. If I want to improve my life, I must create better choices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you will pay dumb tax if you ignore these principles or you will pay to fix the problem. Either way, you are writing a check.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>The road less stupid</em> is designed to accomplish two primary objectives</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide a structure/process/skill set to enable you to create a successful Thinking Time ritual that, if applied, will result in a significantly reduced dumb tax.</li>\n<li>suggest a series of possible Thinking Time topics and questions you can use to spark your thinking, grow your business, make more money and ultimately avoid doing something stupid.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-5-core-disciplines-of-thinking\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-5-core-disciplines-of-thinking\" aria-label=\"the 5 core disciplines of thinking permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE 5 CORE DISCIPLINES OF THINKING</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Find the Unasked Question</strong>-Create a question that will produce clarity and better choices.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Another thing to note is the way the question is framed. It must be framed in such a way that engenders possible solutions or available improvements to the solution. Otherwise, it’s a mere predicament or a statement. So if you must craft a problem, use this “How might I…so that I can…? This rule or guideline provides insight into how to remedy the situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you think of what needs to be broken versus what needs to be fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three characteristics that a carefully crafted question are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides insight into what the actual problem is</li>\n<li>Simplify the problem and make it solvable</li>\n<li>Expand the number of possibilities available to solve the problem at hand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having the correct answer is clever. Having the right question is genius. Or, as Peter Drucker said, “Most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The truly  dangerous thing is asking the wrong question.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>all problems are solvable (or at a minimum can be addressed so that we improve our situation). Our job as business owners and leadership teams is to get clarity on the right question before pulling the trigger. We would all have better answers and more choices if we invested the time to design better questions and allocated some Thinking Time to consider them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separate the Problem from the Symptom</strong> — Identify the obstacle blocking my progress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The key to defining the root problem is discovering the obstacle (it resides in the gap) that is impeding your progress from here to there. The obstacle is the problem, not the dissatisfaction with your current circumstances!</strong></li>\n<li>Most times when I look back at some of the mistakes we made as a company I realize that the problem wasn’t articulated or a wrong statement of the problem. I would usually wonder why we don’t have enough sales, why we don’t have enough customers, low profits, difficulty in finding quality staff, keeping quality staff etc. These are questions that are always on our minds as business owners.</li>\n<li>These questions are very valid but ultimately these questions are not the problems that exist but are instead the symptoms of a problem. We realized that we identified our most significant problems as the gaps between where we were and where we would like to be.</li>\n<li>The symptom is the gap while the problem is the obstacle.</li>\n<li>there are two fundamental difficulties with a misdiagnosis of the root problem (or mislabeling the symptom as the obstacle)\n<ul>\n<li>the questions you ask and the solutions you find are usually tactical</li>\n<li>when the machines are constructed and deployed to address the symptom (but not the root problem, or obstacle), resources are wasted and there is zero sustainable progress toward the desired outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the three most fundamental questions to ask to help get clarity about the root problem/obstacle are:\n<ul>\n<li>what are the possible reasons I’m noticing this symptom?</li>\n<li>what isn’t happening that, if it did happen, would cause the perceived gap (symptoms) to either narrow or disappear?</li>\n<li>what’s happening that, if it stopped happening, would cause the perceived gap (symptoms) to narrow or disappear.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Building a machine for the problem that isn’t and expecting forward progress is delusional.</li>\n<li>If we misdiagnose or mislabel the problem, we will gravitate toward designing solutions and building machines for the symptoms (aka “the problem that isn’t”). This is a prescription for frustration and failure.</li>\n<li>Few things are worse than running in the wrong direction enthusiastically. Misdiagnosing the problem or working on the wrong priorities results in a dumb tax!</li>\n<li>sustainable forward progress (aka “Kicking the Can”) is only possible by identifying\n<ul>\n<li>exactly where I am (Point A)</li>\n<li>exactly where the can is</li>\n<li>exactly where the goal line is in relation to me and the can (Point B) and</li>\n<li>overcoming the obstacle preventing the can from crossing the goal line.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Check Assumptions</strong> - Differentiate the facts from the story I am spinning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>None of us see the assumptions we make about the problem we have, the solution we create, or the opportunity in front of us. The reality is that virtually all my dumb tax could have been avoided if I had questioned a couple of apparent assumptions before pulling the trigger.</li>\n<li><strong>what don’t I see</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>what I don’t see is what costs me money</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Buffet’s response to $20 bet:\n<ul>\n<li>“If I stood here and hit a thousand golf balls, the likelihood that they would go in the hole is very remote. If I hit 10K golf balls I might get lucky and one would go in; but, you’re not offering 10K - 1 odds. I know it’s a small amount of money and I could easily afford it, but it’s bad odds. <strong>Stupid in small things, stupid in big things</strong>”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We would be better off spending some quality Thinking Time differentiating the facts from our emotions and fantasies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consider 2nd-Order Consequences</strong> - Clarify the risks and the possibility/cost of being wrong.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>We only have a choice about the decision we are about to make, not the consequences. An important decision that does not identify the possible risks and the probability and costs of failure is a decision with a high likelihood of creating drama. The problem with drama is that it always costs money.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I use the following three questions as one of my litmus tests to help me think before I act:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>what’s the upside</strong>?</li>\n<li><strong>what is the downside</strong>? What could go wrong? We rarely do this one by ourselves because we’re irrationally emotional and optimistic about what we decide.</li>\n<li><strong>can I live with the downside</strong>?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Risks don’t cease to exist just because you ignore them, nor do facts. An honest assessment of what could go wrong, the probability of it going off the rails, and the cost in the event of failure is fundamental to minimizing your dumb tax.</li>\n<li>Thinking about 2nd-order consequences minimizes the probability of a double bogey. Mistakes are inevitable, but double bogeys are usually avoidable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create the Machine</strong> - Create the executable plan and identify the resources (people and money) required to solve the real (core) problem and progress forward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shoes that don’t fit are not a bargain at any price. A good idea that can’t be executed is a bad idea.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>. Ultimately, the problem gets addressed or solved due to a machine moving me from Point A (where I am) to Point B (where I want to go). I expect the new machine to produce an output that improves my situation, closes the gap, and moves me closer to the desired outcome.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regardless of the change, management must shift priorities if the new solution has a shot at being effective. Changes in the allocation of resources always accompany changes in priorities. Most solutions (machines) fail to produce the anticipated outcomes because management is unclear about the required shifts in focus, human capital, and money.</li>\n<li>Measurement is THE key to sustainability and a culture of accountability.</li>\n<li>finding the dash of paprika (a tiny mistake) ruining your pie requires careful thinking and close observation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"thinking-time-the-process\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#thinking-time-the-process\" aria-label=\"thinking time the process permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THINKING TIME: THE PROCESS</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Designing a Thinking Time process that works for you will be no different than figuring out any other ritual you want to create. The time of day, the best location, and the optimum duration are all discovered through practice and experimentation until you have created a Thinking Time process that best supports your outcomes. The key here is to obsess about obtaining the outcomes and not finding the perfect process!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>step-by-step process/structure for each Thinking Time session</p>\n<ul>\n<li>great thinking time session requires a great question as the launching pad. Before my thinking time session, I will create and write down a question(s) I want to consider.\n<ul>\n<li>create 3 to 5 questions focusing on a common thread or concern.</li>\n<li>sometimes, during actual thinking time sessions, I change only 1 or 2 words in a question to see if I can get a different insight into the issue I’m thinking about.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, the original question might be: “Who is my target market?”, I might change this to “Who is my target market”, I could tweak this question to: “Who is my competition’s target market” That question could easily change to: “If I was starting again today, what market would I target?” I could add this question: “If I wanted to double my sales, what market would I target” This might morph into: “Why aren’t my sales double what they are right now in the market I am currently targeting?”</li>\n<li>optimizing for possibilities (more questions, more possibilities), not completion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>clear calendar for 60 minutes, which will enable me to think for about three-quarters of an hour and then evaluate/sort the solutions and ideas I identified in the last 15 minutes or so</li>\n<li>3 possible scenarios for Thinking Time questions\n<ul>\n<li>create a new question</li>\n<li>revisit a prior question that could use additional thought.</li>\n<li>use an answer from a prior Thinking Time session as the basis for refining/fleshing out/changing the original question and searching for additional possible choices or variations on the theme.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>for most of the questions, one Thinking Time session is insufficient,\n<ul>\n<li>it’s hard to focus for more than about 40 minutes</li>\n<li>usually think about the same question in multiple Thinking Time sessions (2-3 is not uncommon) before finding the elegant answer worthy of execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>close the door, turn off the phones, and eliminate all noise and visual distractions. I sit in my chair (which does not face my computer or a window, where too many distractions and temptations pop up), question, pen, and big chief tablet in hand</li>\n<li>set a timer on my computer alerts me when my Thinking Time has expired and keeps me from fidgeting and looking at my watch.</li>\n<li>right before I start, I sip my water, scratch what itches, go to the bathroom, clear my throat, and sit perfectly still. I have found over the years that my body can derail my thinking and break my concentration. To optimize the thinking process, I must lose touch with my body so that my train of concentration is uninterrupted. During my Thinking Time, I’m motionless except for my right hand, which records my thoughts.</li>\n<li>this is a creative process and not intended to be filtered or judged. If I hit a blank or gap in which nothing is flowing (or my mind starts wandering), I will silently re-ask myself the question I’m working on during the particular session. I might also silently ask myself,\n<ul>\n<li>what else could it be?</li>\n<li>what could I do that would make this problem worse?</li>\n<li>how would my competition solve this problem?</li>\n<li>if I got fired and a new CEO took over, what decision would she make?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I remind myself that I’m looking for ideas and possibilities, not perfection and absolutes. I attempt to avoid judging my ideas. The more judgment I have about an idea during the Thinking Time process, the less creative and more prejudiced I tend to be.</li>\n<li>remarkably, I have found my better ideas tend to emerge during a pattern known as the “third third” The first third of my ideas on any given day are typically the obvious ones. The second third is a variation of the first third. But the last third tends to be the most robust and frequently where the juice is found.</li>\n<li>After 40-45 minutes of Thinking Time. I will always take at least 15-20 mins to read what I have written and capture the best ideas I have uncovered (usually no more than 3)</li>\n<li>the key is to connect the dots, not just collect more dots. I have a separate file in which I keep my best ideas, insights, and distinctions. These ideas can become the basis for a future Thinking Time session or might need to marinate for a few days.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fundamentally, Thinking Time is a structured process that enables me to minimize risks, identify opportunities, and maximize results.

I did not say, “Improving your product or becoming a better plumber is compulsory.” There’s a big difference between winning the gold medal as the best plumber in the world</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(artistic and operational achievement) and winning the gold medal for making $1,000,000/year of bottom-line profit as the plumbing business owner (business success).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Believing passion and operational excellence will trump business skills and risk assessment is a guaranteed prescription for a breathtaking dumb tax.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The victim mentality of the what-you-see-is-what-you-get worldview is the perfect excuse to let you off the hook for taking responsibility for your business’s outcomes and results. Don’t let it. If you want business success, learn the necessary business skills and tools. There is no such thing as a wealthy victim.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the success of every business four different roles must be played or present: Artist (Creator), Operator (Technician), Owner (Business), and Board (Investor)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Every new business always starts with the artist/creator or operator/technician hat. For the former, you are usually passionate about a new idea and feel pumped to take it to the world, while the latter usually has a skill and wants to showcase it to the world.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the primary crisis of most start-ups and small businesses is usually cash, traction, or operational structure, any one of which causes the Owner (Business) and Board (investor) roles to be ignored.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The truth is that as the business grows the required skills to hone are the skills to run a business which include; talent management, reading financial statements, creating dashboards, allocating resources, measuring outcomes, leveraging, delegating duties etc. These skills and many more are needed to take the business from the artistic and operator mindset to the mindset of a business owner, where the business grows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Note that these four hats are always needed at different times throughout the life cycle of any business. Your use/wear them as the need arises in your business allows you to see the business from different angles/sides and make better-informed business decisions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having a hat for each role equips you to think about your business as a whole rather than just a set of discrete activities that must be performed –Keith Cunningham</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Never allow these Hats (Artist, Operator, Business Owner, Investor) to define who you are or your ability. It’s just a way of thinking that you switch to when needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These hats are interchangeable at will but require different mindsets and skills that must be brought to bear in running your business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"./4-hats-business.png\">4 hats of business</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Artistic Hat:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>He has a creative mindset and would always want to change the product or service.</li>\n<li>They fall into the trap that the better they get at their craft, the better they are accepted in the marketplace and therefore more money.</li>\n<li>Companies like Mcdonald’s have long left the artistic hat, in other words, the taste of the burger has remained the same but the system of producing the burger has constant improvement among other things.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, growth and control work inversely. The more growth you desire, the less control you can have (and vice versa).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operator Hat</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>These people are enormous hard workers who believe in adding value through time and effort.</li>\n<li>They believe that the harder you work, the more money they make, which isn’t true.</li>\n<li>They are crisis leaders who apply tactics rather than strategy.</li>\n<li>Firefighters instead of fire preventers</li>\n<li>They don’t run the business; rather the business runs them,</li>\n<li>more often than not, when the operator-drive business fails, it is because the operator has died of exhaustion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Business Owner Hat</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They are usually involved in the planning, execution, measurement, and corrections necessary to lead and manage the business and employees proactively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An owner puts systems and structures in place to keep the company afloat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They focus on leverage to grow the business and are brutal about dashboards because it helps with measurements, accountability, meeting deadlines and delivering results. They use the above to run the business end of the business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They also use the power of delegation to allocate resources where needed to grow the business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usually, the CEO that takes this role</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Board (Investor) Hat</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This is similar to the Business owner’s mindset and focuses more on strategy and growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the key attributes are the abilities to question, probe, think sequentially, substitute rational thought for emotion, anticipate crisis, predict 2nd-order consequences, and identify risks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The majority of dumb taxes incurred directly result from having only one voice in the conversation when the original decision was made. Adding experienced, wise, thoughtful, trustworthy voices to the conversation exposes risks, curtails faulty assumptions, and minimizes stupid.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a board of directors serves as the CEO’s coach/trusted advisor. How members of the board think and what they think about is something every CEO/Owner should emulate, whether or not they have a formal Board. Most significant, successful companies added a board of directors early in their trajectory. Filling this vital role is an integral part of the journey that must be travelled to avoid misguided, overly enthusiastic, irrational lurches that create dub tax and slow value creation and growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s usually filled by a group of people that are not involved in the business’s day-to-day activities but rather have an outside-in look into the business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Their purpose is to expose pitfalls, curtail faulty assumptions, and steer the company from making costly mistakes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>According to Keith Cunningham, The single best business decision you will ever make is to intentionally work with a peer group regularly to question assumptions, ask hard questions (the kind you hope nobody will ask), alert you to icebergs, raise the bar, and push and hold you accountable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In summary. The Artist creates it, the Operator does it, the Business owner leads the team and the investor protects the business and keeps it alive,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>if my business could talk, what would it say?</li>\n<li>which hat has been my comfort zone and which are not getting worn often enough? For that matter, which hats do I not even own, and how can I acquire them?</li>\n<li>what, specifically, have I been ignoring about my business, and what needs to be corrected?</li>\n<li>what skills or tools do I need to learn (or who do I need to hire) to help me overcome the obstacles restricting my growth, sales and profitability?</li>\n<li>what areas of my business could be delegated (or outsourced) to someone else (who is competent and has execution intelligence) to free me up to do the things that would add the most value?</li>\n<li>Artist Hat: What needs to be created?</li>\n<li>Operator Hat: What needs to be done …today?</li>\n<li>Owner Hat: What needs to be structured? Measured? Planned? Delegated?</li>\n<li>Board Hat: What could go wrong? How can I mitigate the probability of that risk occurring and reduce the cost if it does occur?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"culture-is-king-you-get-what-you-tolerate\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#culture-is-king-you-get-what-you-tolerate\" aria-label=\"culture is king you get what you tolerate permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>CULTURE IS KING (YOU GET WHAT YOU TOLERATE)</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The key to a great culture is creating and fostering a never-ending conversation about the “rules of the game.” The rules define the boundaries or guardrails so that everyone knows precisely how to act, communicate, and treat each other. Culture, not a value statement, is the key to high performance and becoming the employer of choice. (Enron’s Value Statement was Respect, Integrity, Communication, and Excellence. A plaque on the wall is not a substitute for culture, nor are nap rooms.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anyone who says customers are #1 has lost their mind! Employees are #1. Employees are the source of all value creation. Culture (not jelly beans in the kitchen) is the source for engaged, turned-on employees. Show me a disinterested employee and I’ll show you a lousy culture, a weak leader, and a poor customer experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you’re about to initiate a cultural shift, be aware of these three common culture saboteurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iceberg #1: Deciding to change the culture within your business is not an initiative for the weak of heart or uncommitted. Creating and sustaining a world-class culture is an ongoing but immensely rewarding initiative. It lowers turnover, improves efficiency, and makes the business a pleasing workplace.</li>\n<li>Iceberg #2: There is always at least one person on a team who thinks he is immune to the culture transformation conversation.</li>\n<li>Iceberg #3: An unenforced rule is not a rule; it’s a suggestion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We hesitate to have hard conversations because we don’t care enough. If you truly cared enough, you would say what needs to be said. After all, how else will they improve and maximize their potential? Let me remind you that nothing can change until the unsaid is spoken.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To understand what culture is, let’s begin with what it’s not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s not a mission, value, or vision statement plaque we hang on our company wall.</li>\n<li>The coddling of employees; e.g. nap rooms, concierge to pick up the dry cleaned clothes of the employees, stocking the kitchen with red bull, spa coupons for employees,</li>\n<li>Sad to say that the above DOES NOT drive culture, it instead drives an entitlement mentality in your employees.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Culture is result-oriented…getting stuff done is at the core of any organization’s culture. It’s the guard rails or guiding principles by which everyone must live by. It is ingrained in the heart and soul of the business (employees and employers). It is woven into the very fabric of the organization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Keith’s words “Culture is how we treat each other, how we talk to each other, whether or not we trust each other, and how we handle conflict. Culture is about accountability, measuring, a bias for urgency, a focus on solutions, calling it tight—saying what needs to be said—being kind and generous, acknowledging one another, and expressing appreciation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Craig’s list of ads</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If you can commit and live with the following principles, then you will be successful and help our company thrive.

Pros never need motivating.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Show me a lousy culture, and I will show you a lousy CEO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The key is clarity on the obstacle and consistency of disciplined execution on the critical drivers. Consistency requires measurement. Discipline requires standards. Execution requires resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are seven yardsticks that a CEO must be judged by to produce quality results consistently:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clearly define Point A and Point B</strong>: Most CEOs or leaders are very good at articulating where they are going to (Point B) or what you might call the vision. It’s funny how most CEOs give a stunning presentation of the future they don’t have 100% control of but find it hard to determine where they are now (Part A); their present state. It’s only natural to know where we are going after knowing where you are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>“Determine the obstacle”</strong> This is only gotten when there is a clear definition of points A and B. This obstacle is also known as the gap. This is the reason why you haven’t attained or achieved point B. At this stage, you must separate the problem from the symptom and focus on the real issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Design the plan/machine:</strong> After clearly defining points A and B, the obstacle or gap, the next thing is to build a machine to address the problems above. The CEO can delegate at this stage or get his team members to be part of this so they can also own and run with it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Allocate resources:</strong> Once you determine the solution/machine to be used, the next thing is to allocate adequate resources to make the machine work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As Keith Cunningham said, “A shift in priorities without a simultaneous shift in resource allocation is delusional. Anytime we announce new initiatives or change priorities, it requires a change in how we are allocating our resources (team, time, and money) must be allocated in such a way that permits the business to stay afloat while trying to birth and execute this new initiative or idea with this new machine. It also requires that we do less of one thing to allow us to do more of something else. None of us can keep adding without curtailing or stopping something else.”</li>\n<li>Keith Cunningham says it perfectly “In other words, the CEO must plan tomorrow’s breakfast while continuing to cook tonight’s dinner.” This is very tricky and requires much skill to execute adequately; you must know how to reduce resources to increase it for another task.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Team players:</strong> This is so crucial to the workings of the machine. Machines don’t operate themselves; they need people to run them. The quality of the machine’s output is directly proportional to the quality of the team players. So everyone on your team must bring their A-game to bear on the task. Mediocrity should never have a place in your team. The watchword here is “Mastery.” Like Keith Cunningham said, “Said another way, business success is highly dependent on whom you hire and don’t fire.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here are some tips to distinguish A players include:\n<ul>\n<li>They have a scoreboard that helps them with measurements. They will not play if they can’t see the scoreboard</li>\n<li>They love healthy competition.</li>\n<li>They love accountability.</li>\n<li>they have the technical chops to do the job. This is not their first rodeo. They have been there, done that, and they are technically very good at what they do.</li>\n<li>They are humble enough to ask for coaching. The three most important questions an employee can ask are\n<ul>\n<li>what else can I do</li>\n<li>where can I get better?</li>\n<li>what do I need to do or learn to continue to grow?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>They are good at what they do and consistently seek to improve.</li>\n<li>They see opportunities, while others see problems.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>rules for hiring and retaining A players are\n<ul>\n<li>interview rigorously</li>\n<li>compensate generously</li>\n<li>onboard effectively</li>\n<li>measure consistently</li>\n<li>coach continuously.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Build the organization chart/structure:</strong> This must be emphasized. It’s one of the differences between good companies and great companies. People or personnel must operate within a structure known as the organizational chart. A structure gives support and protects your business. Most importantly, the structure must be outcomes/result oriented instead of roles, titles, or names. In other words, every role must have tasks, outcomes, and deliverables that are assigned to people, and excuses for non or under-performance are not allowed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create a culture:</strong> Culture is a way of life. As a CEO, whatever you put in place as a culture will run into the fabric of your business. You must show that you are accountable, you care, and have a deep desire for success.

Facts do not cease to exist just because you ignore them. A good market tends to hide mistakes. Nothing takes the place of being actively engaged in running your business and being thoughtful (as well as skeptical) about the future.</li>\n<li>Last week’s marketing report has absolutely nothing to do with where the market is headed, what the economy is doing, or what the demand will be next year.</li>\n<li>How you run your business during the good times is the only true predictor of how well your business will cope with the bad times.</li>\n<li>You must keep a conservative strategy during the good times because you generally don’t know you’re in bad times until it’s too late.</li>\n<li>No team has ever won a game with an “offence only” strategy. Great teams, the ones who win championship rings, all have fantastic defences. They think about prevention, protection, and risks.</li>\n<li>Not all progress is measured by ground gained; sometimes, progress is measured by losses avoided.</li>\n<li>Speed kills. True wealth is built slowly. Speed and greed necessitate aggressive leverage and increase the odds of catastrophe. It is better to go slower and avoid the do-overs.</li>\n<li>Our desire for growth and size was based on ego and greed, not strategy and wealth.</li>\n<li>The successful people we admire are not the ones who made it. We admire the ones who kept it.</li>\n<li>Owners MUST be hands-on and involved in every aspect of the business.</li>\n<li>We acted like it was a sin to miss a revenue opportunity. That makes as much sense as needing to eat everything at a Sunday buffet.</li>\n<li>Do not be afraid to say “no.” Saying “yes” does not always equal more.</li>\n<li>It’s delusional to believe our ability, intellect, and work ethic can overcome a bad market.</li>\n<li>Litigation is expensive, time-consuming, and to be avoided.</li>\n<li>The best way to avoid losses and to stay financially healthy is to “sell too soon.” The old real estate maxim “In the history of the world, the seller is always wrong” is outrageously stupid when you run out of cash!</li>\n<li>Don’t fall into the trap of believing you can sell it for a higher price tomorrow. The future is unknown (and unknowable) and fraught with risk.</li>\n<li>I would rather miss an opportunity than lose capital in the future. Never buy something because you think you might need it someday. Keep working on all your alternatives until something closes. It hasn’t closed until the money is in the bank.</li>\n<li>Success does not make you invincible or bulletproof. What success does best is make you complacent and egotistical, which are sufficient to create disaster.</li>\n<li>The euphoria of a hot market usually results in ignoring marketplace fundamentals. Gathering and evaluating market-based economic information is the only prescription for avoiding the mistake of smoking your exhaust.</li>\n<li>Never delay taking corrective action once the problem has been recognized. Hoping for better conditions in the future so the problem will solve itself is a fool’s game. Procrastination magnifies problems.</li>\n<li>Failure to recognize reality is delusional. You might be smarter and better than your competition, but when the market shifts, you’re still broke. Don’t confuse intellect with economic reality.</li>\n<li>Never rely on only your consultant’s recommendations. If you don’t understand it, don’t do it.</li>\n<li>We did not narrow our focus when we knew times were getting worse. This was due to two things: (1) The distraction of our prior track record and (2) An unwillingness to assess the risks of being wrong.</li>\n<li>A small percentage of a large number is a large number.</li>\n<li>Any fool can make money in the good times.</li>\n<li>The question should never be, “Should I pursue this opportunity?” The right questions are:</li>\n<li>If I pursue this opportunity, how much time, resources, effort, and investment are required?</li>\n<li>Is this in my wheelhouse (core competence)?</li>\n<li>What could go wrong?</li>\n<li>What are the returns if I am right and the costs if I am wrong? Can I live with being wrong?</li>\n<li>The more significant the past success, the greater the likelihood of the Superman fantasy. A lack of cash or cash flow is Kryptonite, and it kills all superheroes. Always be skeptical and keep some powder dry.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Doing a deal to keep the staff busy is stupid. Do not do marginal deals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A bad economy doesn’t create financial problems but reveals them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Almost everything takes longer than you think it will and costs more than originally budgeted. Plan for delays and bumps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Just because prices have increased in the last several years doesn’t mean they can’t go down 30% next year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The easiest sale is to an employee or a consultant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When the market is terrible, there are NO buyers… at any price.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delaying the decision to sell today because last year’s prices were higher or because the anticipated profits originally projected were greater is stupid. The market doesn’t care about it, either.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not follow the market down. Make deep cuts quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t let what your competition is doing influence your decisions. You can’t erect a fence to keep the competition out. Besides, they do stupid things sometimes too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Secondary locations always decline the fastest (and most) and take the longest to return.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New projects must be based on current demand rather than future growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You do not have to swing at every pitch that is thrown. Do fewer, better deals. Not only will you optimize the results of the superior deals, but you will also have far less overhead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Too many deals consume time and draw attention away from the good ones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It takes three good deals to make up for one lousy deal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When a lousy deal surfaces, 90% of management’s time is siphoned off from the rest of the business to deal with the problems it generates. The result: The bad one is still bad, and the good ones are now mediocre or troubled due to a lack of attention. Ninety percent of management’s time should be spent on nurturing the good ones. Easy to say, hard to do.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Holding off on adjusting the price or overhead based on the belief that the market will rebound quickly is irrational.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Financing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debt gives the illusion of wealth. True wealth is assets, cash flow, and manageable (minimal) debt.</li>\n<li>Excessive debt and hope are the root of all financial crises. You can never ignore risks or suspend doubt.</li>\n<li>Doing a marginal deal just because the money is available is stupid. Bankers typically can’t assess the market risks either.</li>\n<li>Take your personal guarantee seriously. You only bring two things to the table: cash and your guarantee, neither of which has an unlimited supply.</li>\n<li>Don’t rely on future price increases to make a deal work. Never finance long-term assets with short-term debt.</li>\n<li>We covered a lot of mistakes with access to an abundance of money and easy credit.</li>\n<li>Too much money makes you stupid. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.</li>\n<li>Stretching to do a deal by horsing the numbers in a spreadsheet is usually a sign of ego and rarely a good idea.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Personnel</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bench strength is critical. Please find the best people and compensate them very well. It saves money in the long run.</li>\n<li>The tougher the times, the better the people you need. There is no way to survive a bad market with weak people.</li>\n<li>Adding/keeping mediocre people weakens the organization, which dilutes your results.</li>\n<li>Always be upgrading your talent and never be afraid to pay them what they need to make.</li>\n<li>Every hire we make should raise the average.</li>\n<li>One superstar 7-footer is far more valuable than ten 5-footers. Weak people beget weak results.</li>\n<li>Always address personnel issues or substandard performance. Employees are either doing a great job, or they aren’t. If they aren’t, take action. My job isn’t to babysit or beg people to do their jobs.</li>\n<li>The cost of tolerating an incapable or misplaced employee is far greater than the discomfort of having a tough conversation and speedy termination.</li>\n<li>A culture rooted in past successes, growth at all costs, and aggressive bonus structures will produce employees who don’t think, aren’t skeptical, and ignore risks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Overhead</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stay lean even if you can afford to get fat. Keep overhead low!</li>\n<li>Watch your cash very closely. Ask yourself, “Do I really need this? Will this help me make more money?” Once the money is spent, it’s gone forever.</li>\n<li>Get sober (medieval) on what needs to happen to your cost structure to produce the profits you want vs. the revenue you hope to get.</li>\n<li>Each line item of your financials should be scrutinized continuously to ensure the money is being spent in a productive and prudent way.</li>\n<li>Conserve cash, especially during the good times. Spending money to look like a big deal is not the same as being a big deal.</li>\n<li>When you’re out of cash, you’re out of business. Cash is truly KING.</li>\n<li>When the market shifts, you can’t cut overhead fast enough.</li>\n<li>it is easy to overpay or beef up when the world is viewed from only an upside perspective.</li>\n<li>Cut overhead early and hard. Pride and hubris kept us from cutting our overhead in a timely manner.</li>\n<li>Fancy offices, hot cars, lots of staff, and high overhead are signs of significance, not success.</li>\n<li>Knowing your numbers-what it costs to run each aspect of your business and having timely information are critical to success.</li>\n<li>Focus on the business costs and not just the revenue potential.</li>\n<li>Paying for overhead we don’t need to support revenue we don’t have is stupid.</li>\n<li>Contract out as much of the work as possible.

Start with their needs, desires, and pain. Start with the gap between the solutions the competition offers and where they (the customers) are frustrated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In this chapter, Keith describes a story where he interrogates his wife on how to be a better husband to her. Most importantly, what she wants/desires in a relationship, he starts with what she wants in a relationship and she replies “I want to be Loved and Adored.” This was her goal. Then he asked her “Now, tell me everything that needs to happen and exactly what it would look like for you to feel loved and adored.” He kept writing the answers to that question for almost an hour and a half. He wondered why she wanted all this, but it was what she wanted. Period. Even though he didn’t have the passion for it, he was ready to do everything he could to make it happen. He even asked what happens if he forgets, she smiled and said I will remind you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Let’s pause here and think for a moment and analyze the story.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He asked her for her goal, and she verbalized it.</li>\n<li>He then asked her what success means by asking “Now, tell me everything that needs to happen and exactly what it would look like for you to feel loved and adored.” Here, he wanted her to verbalize what she wanted in plain language.</li>\n<li>He was also committed to making it happen even though he didn’t have the passion for it.</li>\n<li>As a business owner, you must always determine what the customer wants. You are in business because of the customer. Most people make the mistake of creating the product and then looking for the customer. Here, you find out their pain points, needs and most importantly what success means to them.</li>\n<li>Once you have gotten their needs and pain points, the next thing is to find a solution that meets their need and their success proposition</li>\n<li>Finally, your service/product delivery must be out of this world and exceptional. If this is not done well, you will jeopardize all the hard work you have put into creating the product. You are likely not to return to a restaurant with crappy service no matter how good the food tastes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>principles to attract customers and gain significant traction in any business</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>FOWTW:</strong>: Find out what they want.

This is how you deliver a solution… the experience and execution. How do I deliver to them?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To conclude, I would like to borrow these words from Peter Drucker, who says that selling becomes unnecessary when marketing is done right.

Is the problem that\n- You don't understand what we want? \n- You haven't been adequately trained?\n- You don't care what the lobby looks like despite this being a critical part of your job?\n- We just got slammed with many customers, and there hasn't been time to clean this up yet.\n- You don't understand the importance of this job and doing it how we expect it to be done?\n- You don't own your job and are unaware of the consequences of not doing the job you were hired to do?\n\nHelp me understand why this problem doesn't get fixed and stay fixed.</code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Patty, you have a job here. To keep your job, you must do the work. The job and the work, go hand in hand. It has now reached the point that it feels like we are begging you to do the work, which makes no sense because you never have to beg me for your paycheck. Neither of us wants to beg, and neither should have to. You are an intelligent woman; you understand what we expect. But, for some reason, it isn't getting done consistently.\nHere is what I know: When my effort to help you get better exceeds your effort to get better, this stops working for both of us.\nIt seems the problem might have something to do with what you believe. For this to continue to be a topic of conversation, maybe you hear what we want but mistakenly believe what we are requesting is optional. Perhaps you believe we are just kidding when we tell you keeping the lobby picked up, and clean is part of your job. You might believe we will not notice or, if we do notice, maybe you believe we will not say anything. You might believe you can avoid doing your job and we will pay you anyway, or even raise you for not doing your job. Maybe you believe that you can keep your job but not do the work.\nHelp me understand what you believe about this.</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where have I posted the speed limit poorly (explicitly stating expectations, deliverables, and outcomes)?</li>\n<li>Who are the people in my organization that seem to require repeat conversations about the same issue?</li>\n<li>What is the “belief coaching” they need to clarify the correct beliefs that will enable them to do and keep their job?</li>\n<li>What is the deliverable that is missing?</li>\n<li>What is the outcome I want that isn’t being delivered?</li>\n<li>Where am I frustrated because an employee is not performing at the standard I expect (and set)?</li>\n<li>Is the problem that I haven’t set a clear standard?</li>\n<li>Is the problem a lack of specificity about what I want it to look like?

The inevitable result is chaos and a gravitational pull toward the urgent. Leverage is the bridge that transitions the Owner of a business from Operator mode to Owner mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The price of entrepreneurial success is discipline and structure. Keith Cunningham put it very well, “Sometimes the problem we started out to solve mutates. If we miss the shift, we will try to solve the new problem using solutions for the old problem. Chances are, those old solutions for the previous problem are useless.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keith Cunningham defines Structure as designing, planning, and constructing the skeleton of the business so there is a foundation and support configuration to enable the business to profitably take advantage of the opportunities available.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>your business needs that structure to give it foundation, support and most importantly sustainable growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It stems from your core values, core focus and culture as the foundation and then the structure is built. It includes hiring right, putting systems and processes in place, designing the machine (solution) or even the engine of the machine. Anything that puts some form of order and allows things to run smoothly is what makes up structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Structure is what transcends you from working in your business to working on your business. It gives you the leverage to have a bird’s eye view of the business. In other words, it takes you from being an operator in the business to a business owner. It is a structure that gives you that leverage. Without it comes excess fatigue and frustration that in turn affects your customers and then takes your business on a steady decline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To end this, I would like to borrow Keith’s words that say: “Success is not an accident.

Goals are not plans. Goals are ideas; few things are dumber than executing an idea without strategy or planning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The stupidest thing management can do is to announce some lofty goal for the year (“Our revenue target is $6,000,000 this year.”) without any thought about the working plan to attain it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One of the hardest parts of designing the journey is being sober about reality and painstakingly honest about your current situation. Psychiatric hospitals are filled with people who are delusional about reality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>my life works to the degree I keep my commitments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t let your obsession with the dream get in the way of noticing the demand. Or, as my friends on Wall Street say, “When the duck quacks, feed it.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being aware of the most common misconceptions and goal-setting mistakes will help you avoid these pitfalls and minimize the likelihood of sabotaging the attainment of your desired outcomes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The goal setter focuses exclusively on the goal (Point B). Rarely is consideration given to the reality of where you are (Point A). One of the hardest parts of designing the journey is being sober about reality and painstakingly honest about your current situation.</li>\n<li>The goal is typically little more than wishful thinking. So, we chant the magic goal-setting words with the expectation that this psychobabble verbal wizardry will create the desired outcome, even though there is no specific path, metrics, or specific, executable plan to achieve it. You will immediately know whether your goals are goals or simply fantasies by tracking your effort.</li>\n<li>The goal is not structured as a nonnegotiable but rather as a hope. We would all be better off having fewer goals and more standards. If the thing you want is important enough to set as a goal, why not make its attainment a nonnegotiable standard (a “must”) instead of a desirable aspiration (a “should”-thank you, Tony Robbins)? When you boil it down, a should means doing your best; a must means doing whatever it takes. Said a different way: You get what you tolerate. Most of my goal-setting friends stumble at the beginning of the process because of a desire to dabble rather than burn the ships and commit. The emotional tug of continuing searching for an easier path or an early exit is hard to resist. My life works to the degree I keep my commitments.</li>\n<li>The goal setter rarely has accountability on either the execution of the critical drivers required to move toward the goal or the ultimate attainment of it. This explains why the typical goal-setter makes the same goals year after year. No one to hold them accountable.</li>\n<li>Goal setters tend to fall in love with the goal instead of falling in love with the things that need to be done to accomplish the goal. In other words, they fall in love with the effect (goal) instead of the cause (critical drivers). If the critical driver for goal achievement were to want it bad enough or to visualize rays of sunshine emanating from your head, the human race would be rich, in a loving relationship and great physical shape.</li>\n<li>Often, the goal setter compares her business to her friends’ or competitors’ to decide what goal to set, or she finds what’s wrong and fantasizes about what the business would be like if she was there and not here. In other words, this type of goal setting makes what she wants bad (wrong) and good (right). Being critical or judgmental about your current conditions is guaranteed to create massive unhappiness. I suggest that gratitude be injected into the process because everything is not “bad.” We all have a long list of things to be grateful for. Never say, “It can’t get any worse,” because it can worsen. I love H. Ross Perot defines an entrepreneur as “Someone who is grateful for the progress that has been made and simultaneously dissatisfied with the rate they are making it.”</li>\n<li>We know that clarity on points A and B is critical to success. We also know that overcoming some obstacles preventing the attainment of this outcome is fundamental to success. Amazon has been particularly adept at walking this fine line with its willingness to invest, make mistakes, learn, and adjust to match the demand in the market.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take a look at where you are in your life today. Chances are these three things are true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Where you are today is beyond your wildest dreams compared to what you thought was possible when you were eighteen.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The route you took to get here was unpredictable from your vantage point as an eighteen-year-old.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The path that got you here was anything but linear or planned. If your life even remotely resembles mine, your path to this point is the most convoluted and tortuous route imaginable. Yet, here I am!</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When I think about the outcomes (goals) we have set for the coming quarter or year, where do I need clarity about my starting point regarding environment, resources, competition, etc.?</li>\n<li>Who can I ask to help me think through our reality to minimize the likelihood of tricking myself about our starting point or current capabilities?</li>\n<li>What is the specific path/plan we have designed to move us from here to there, and what additional colour or specificity do I need to add to this path to make it executable?</li>\n<li>What would it take to transition our plans from “shoulds” (wouldn’t it be nice if…) to “musts” (failure is not an option)?</li>\n<li>What are the hard decisions and actions I have been postponing in the irrational hope I can “goal” it away?</li>\n<li>What are the non-negotiable standards we must establish?</li>\n<li>What am I tolerating in my business that is sabotaging my results or incongruent with my standards?</li>\n<li>How do we build in the accountability required for the critical driver standards and outcomes we have committed to achieving?</li>\n<li>What specificity do I need to add to our plan so everyone on the team has a clear, measurable metric (target) they are shooting for?</li>\n<li>What are the specific causes I must identify that will enable the effect I want to happen?</li>\n<li>What have we done well, and what am I grateful for?</li>\n<li>What unexpected opportunities are being presented that might move us in the direction we want but don’t look the way we thought they would look?

I did not do my job. I have allowed my lack of courage and desire to keep the peace to get in the way of being a leader. I tolerated the status quo and mediocrity because I didn't want to have the hard conversations. I mistakenly believed it was more important to keep the peace than to have the courage required to lead.\nI admire and respect you, but I have let my admiration for you cloud my\njudgment and my willingness to say what needs to be said. Candidly, I have probably functioned in a friend and peer role and not in an Owner and leader role. I elevated being liked over being successful. I have been more in love with the tranquility than I have with our outcomes.\nOne of the transitions all successful businesses must navigate is from mom- and-pop free-for-all (let's all pitch in and get it done) to a more professional, disciplined management kind of structure. I made the mistake of giving people big titles and extensive latitude in the erroneous belief that this would produce an outcome-driven, results-oriented organization in which people were accountable for their results. I was wrong.\nWhat I need to do is what every sustainably successful organization in the history of mankind has done, and that is to transition from being a company of ideas, fire drills, drama, and fuzziness to a company of outcomes, standards, accountability, and results.\n\nThe truth of the matter is we can have the best vision and mission statement in the world, but if no one has a clue as to how that translates to\n  - an obstacle we must overcome\n  - an outcome we are striving to achieve\n  - an executable plan\n  - a set of critical driver activities\n  - a standard of excellence\n  - a dashboard that gives us optics .accountability and ownership\n\nthen we have no shot at accomplishing that mission or delivering on those values.\n\nIf no one knows exactly where we are and exactly what we are trying to accomplish, we will not understand the problem we are trying to solve or the gap we are trying to close. If we don't have clarity of exactly what the obstacle is we are attempting to overcome, how do we prioritize resources or build a machine that allows us to get from here to there?\n\nIf you look at an F-16 fighter jet, the sophistication of the dials and dashboards is breathtaking. Why is that? Because an F-16 is a high-performance machine. If a mistake is made in an F-16, someone is likely to die. Compare that to a tricycle, a low-performance machine. It has no cockpit or dashboard. It does not go very fast and takes a ton of manual effort to get from here to there. If a mistake is made on a tricycle, the worst that happens is a scab on your knee.\n\nThe higher the performance or the faster you want to go, the greater the need for a cockpit of dials and dashboards. The greater the need for precise measurements, standards, structure, and accountability.\n\nPilots of high-performance machines do not fly by the seat of their pants. Yet I have tolerated a culture of \"hand crank\" tricycle performance, which helps explain why we are not achieving our full potential for our stakeholders. We have high maintenance and I am optimizing for high performance.\n\nHere is where I need your help. What I want us to do is identify the obstacles that are in our way, design the strategy and build the machine that will allow us to overcome these obstacles, prioritize and thoughtfully allocate the resources required, measure our results against the standards we have set, and hold everyone accountable for their part of the process.\n\nWe will have three rules of the game:\n1. Rule #1: Do the right thing.\n  a. Have a plan, work the plan.\n  b. Measure your results.\n  c. Be accountable-see it; own it; solve it; do it.\n2. Rule #2. Do the best you can.\n  a. Turn problems into opportunities.\n  b. Add value by becoming part of the solution.\n  c. Act with a sense of urgency... Do it now! \n  d. Ask the question: \"What else can I do?\" \n  e. Ask for coaching: \"What can I do better?\" f. Reject average and \"good enough.\" \n  g. Learn, correct, improve, and grow.\n3. Rule #3: Show others that you care. \n  a. Show respect.\n  b. Say: \"Please. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm sorry.\" \n  c. Show and express appreciation.\n  d. Have each other's back (\"I got you!\").\n  e. Engage as a team.\n\nIf we do these things and play by these rules we will close the gap. Not only will we close the gap, we will build a high-performance team.\nSo, here is the question you each need to answer: \"Do I want to be a part of helping me create this team?\"</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thinking Time</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>I know that making the decision to give the apology speech is just the beginning.

Clarifying the gap is critical because residing in this gap is the obstacle that is preventing forward progress from here to there. All obstacles are in the gap between where you are and where you want to be. If you cannot identify a gap, the obstacle isn’t even on your radar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can’t create a strategy or prioritize your resources until you have clarity on the opportunity and the obstacles preventing progress toward the attainment of that opportunity (outcome).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A strategy is the idea about what needs to happen to overcome the obstacle preventing forward progress. Without clarity about the core problem (the obstacle), a plan (the specific action steps required to implement the strategy) is a waste of time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“stragetic growth” implies a willingness to realistically think through the existing internal assets and external needcs/pain that could define an opportunity for leveraged growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the concept of strategic growth is in sharp contrast to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“Brute force growth</strong> - which Proctor &#x26; Gamble and the remainder of the fortune 500 engage in. They have massive resources: time, money, consultants, and employees.</li>\n<li><strong>“Hopium” growth</strong> - which counts on getting lucky and finding a few customers who buy, but never really quite understanding which market segment they represent or why those folks are buying. These customers tend to be very transient and are at high risk of being lured away by the competition.</li>\n<li><strong>“Tactical” growth</strong> - which subscribes to the theory that increasing the size of the funnel, adding two new salespeople, doubling the conversion percentage, rebuilding the website, and initiating a social media campaign (all tactics) are the one-size-fits-all answer to all growth and revenue problems.</li>\n<li><strong>“Throw it against the wall and maybe something will stick” growth</strong> - which relies on the erroneous belief that if you just turn on the faucet, hot water will eventually come out.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strategic growth relies on a simple formula:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Internal Strengths + External Needs = Opportunity</strong></li>\n<li>Internal strengths require you to think, analyze, and question.</li>\n<li>External needs force you to ask, probe, and listen.</li>\n<li>Opportunity is only available with structure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Though this formula is not complicated, the execution of these steps to attain meaningful results is VERY intense and difficult, which is why business success is so elusive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step One:</strong> The formula for strategic growth starts with internal strengths because no one has the time, money, or expertise to solve every problem the market faces. Without a realistic assessment of our internal leveragable assets, I might have the skills to create great software products but end up selling cheeseburgers because I found a pocket of people who were hungry. I probably know nothing about cheeseburgers and restaurants, but here I am because I didn’t start my thinking process with what I know and am good at so I ended up where I didn’t plan on landing.</li>\n<li>Knowing your strengths and assets is key to strategic growth. A thorough review of your underutilized assets and points of leverage is the critical jumping-off point for designing a strategic growth initiative.</li>\n<li><strong>Step Two:</strong> You must perform a thorough assessment of the marketplace, the external environment, and the competition. It is critical to realize that the market is not one huge mass but rather a collection of small, sometimes tiny groups of people who have a common, but specific, problem (need/pain). Chances are there is a common denominator for penetrating this target market cost-effectively. They probably have a similar definition of success,\n<ul>\n<li>We are all aware that you can do the right thing at the wrong time; consequently, paying careful attention to the environment is equally critical in the external assessment process.</li>\n<li>Knowing the competition-particularly where the gaps are between what your competitors are doing and where their customers are frustrated-is vital to strategic growth. (The chapter “O Baby!” vividly illustrates this point.) Knowing precisely what the competition is good at and why customers are currently buying from them is a must in researching your strategic growth opportunities.</li>\n<li>We want to minimize the brain damage of becoming a “me too” business with no meaningful competitive promise and, therefore, an inability to articulate a valid reason for the customer to make the switch from a competitor to you. I will remind you that differentiation is not a promise.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Step Three:</strong> Integrating your internal leveragable strengths with the reality of the external needs/pains/gaps in the market defines the opportunity you should consider pursuing. Part of this analysis requires you to think in terms of buyer segments (niche) and the common denominators these segments will possess.\n<ul>\n<li>The opportunity will also give you optics about the level of investment required to pursue a given segment. To make any new opportunity financially successful will require a certain organizational structure and leadership as well as specific skill sets and expertise. You will possibly need to augment your team or incur certain risks to turn this possible opportunity into reality. Clarity on what you are good at (and can leverage) plus clarity on the needs of the target customers and the competition that is currently servicing them equals clarity about the opportunity to strategically grow your business with minimum wasted motion, resources, and dumb tax.</li>\n<li>Of equal value is an acute understanding of where the market is going. In effect, you are running two businesses simultaneously: the one that is providing revenue today and the one that will generate revenue tomorrow. It is highly unlikely they are the same business. The difference will be what happens externally to cause the transition and what you do internally to respond.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This “buy a bigger bullhorn, find a taller mountain, and scream it at the top of your lungs” approach is a poor substitute for a razor-sharp focus on market segments and on discovering the true pain/problem your product or service solves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sustained success requires strategy. And strategy requires</p>\n<ul>\n<li>clarity on the obstacle or problem;</li>\n<li>a plan to overcome the obstacle;</li>\n<li>a structure for the allocation of resources;</li>\n<li>prioritization of time and activities; and - an analysis of risk.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marketing is about getting people to notice what you do. Execution is about doing something people will notice. Never assume it is all one and none of the other. Strategic growth requires both!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Internal Strengths (Under-leveraged Assets)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What special or core skills, expertise, knowledge, strengths, and competencies do we have?</li>\n<li>Do we have any special or leveragable relationships or alliances in our customer list or network of contacts and associates that could influence (or give us access to) groups of potential target buyers?</li>\n<li>What are the key alliances, testimonials, or “influencer” relationships we have (or could develop) that would influence potential buyers?</li>\n<li>Competitively, why do customers buy from us?

If they doubt that your product or service will work as effectively or efficiently as the product they are currently buying or that something could go wrong, they will not make the switch.</li>\n<li><strong>Friction:</strong> Sometimes potential customers do not buy because the brain damage associated with switching is too great. They look at all the friction costs that would be incurred and resources consumed in the set-up, retraining, installation, adoption, de-installation, breaking old habits, and implementation of new procedures and processes and realize the pain of the change is not worth the gain. Minimizing friction costs is a critical driver for growth.</li>\n<li><strong>The Difference That Makes the Difference:</strong> Confused customers rarely buy. If a potential customer does not have a clear understanding of what you can do for them that is meaningful/important and is not available elsewhere, they are unlikely to make the switch.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Here is the key: The only way you can describe the difference between you and everybody else who wants their business is to have a granular understanding of what your competitors do and how what you do is meaningfully different. You must be able to tell a customer: “This is what we do and here is why this is important and unique. Other venders do not do this; they do that. If you want that, you should buy from them. If you want this, you should buy from us.” (The ominously titled chapter “The Triangle of Death” underscores the risk of failing to communicate this message. You might also take a look at “Simplifying Growth” for additional thoughts on this subject.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Success Proposition:</strong> Here it is on a bumper sticker: Value created but not delivered is of no value.

Using your best estimate, assign a probability of occurrence next to each risk and record this probability in the column marked Step #2.</li>\n<li>The probability of occurrence is expressed in a percentage. For example, if one of the risks you have identified is that interest rates will go up to at least 7% in the next three years, and you think the probability of that happening is 40%, then in column 2, next to that risk, write down “40%.”</li>\n<li>For this exercise, do not worry about risks that have less than a 2% probability of occurring. These are remote risks. And, while they might occur, we have bigger fish to fry than the bottom 2%.</li>\n<li>After you have made an educated, realistic guesstimate about the probability of each risk occurring, highlight the Top 10 highest-probability risks (the ones with the highest estimated percentage). The Top 10 will be the ones for you to focus on for the remainder of this Risk Assessment exercise, because they are the ones that are most likely to happen.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step #3</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For each Top 10 risk (only the Top 10), decide if the financial cost of that risk (should it occur) is low [1-3], medium [4-7], or high [8–10]. Then, using your best estimate, assign an estimated cost of occurrence numerical ranking (low, medium, or high) next to each Top 10 risk and record this numerical estimate (1-10) in the column marked Step #3.</li>\n<li>A low-cost risk [1-3] is analogous to having a piece of sand in your shoe. It irritates and is not much fun to deal with, but you can still walk and function at 90% capacity.</li>\n<li>A medium-cost risk [4-7] is like having a broken leg. Walking is impossible for the short term, but you are still mobile and can function, albeit at a much slower pace and with much greater effort than before you broke your leg. With a medium-cost risk, the incapacitation is for a limited period of time, but the limp is noticeable and changes the way you play the game.</li>\n<li>A high-cost risk [8–10] is a total game changer or even death. If this risk occurs, it is a major disruption to the business, a train wreck, or worst case- bankruptcy. At a bare minimum, a high-cost risk is paralysis that will require years of physical therapy to overcome.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step #4</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For each Top 10 risk (only the Top 10), decide if the risk is controllable [1- 3], manageable [4-7], or uncontrollable [8–10]. Using your best realistic guess, assign an estimated manageability of occurrence numerical ranking (low, medium, or high) next to each Top 10 risk and record this numerical estimate (1-10) in the column marked Step #4.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Controllable risks [1-3] are extremely rare because there is very little we can totally control, especially if there is risk attached to it. (I cannot control whether or not I am in an automobile accident, but I can control how fast I’m driving, if I’m wearing a seat belt, or if I’m texting while I drive.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Manageable risks [4-7] are risks I don’t have complete total control over but I can influence or manage the likelihood of them happening or the cost if they do happen. I might not be able to control whether or not my best salesperson decides to leave for another job, but I can certainly influence her decision-making process with the compensation package, title, administrative support, culture, and feelings of importance and contribution to the business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uncontrollable risks [8-10] are things like the economy, the price of oil, government regulations, interest rates, and the competition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now draw the Risk Assessment bubble chart on the following page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Let me leave you with this serious warning: If two or three fairly high-probability risks [7-10] are clustered in the upper right-hand corner of the bubble chart, run!

They tend to love their idea and become obsessed with the product. Inevitably the entrepreneur will speak about this new project or idea in terms of being “my passion.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This creates two related problems. First, the market does not care how much you love your idea or how passionate you are about it. Your customers do not spend money on your product just because it happens to be your life’s purpose. Customers want to get out of pain, avoid a pain, or create a gain, and either you can do that “better” or more efficiently than the competition or you can’t.</li>\n<li>Second, obsessing about your product or your passion is an internal focus. Optimizing for passion and product perfection instead of customer needs and demand is a classic business mistake. If your intention is to generate sales and make money with your product, then an obsession with the customer is mandatory. Think about it this way: You and your customers are in a relationship. <em>Relationships tend to work best when the focus is on meeting the needs of the other party, not our own.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What does my business need to be successful? Does it need structure, better teammates, less drama, fewer expenses, more cash in the bank, less accounts receivable? One of my favorite questions to ask is this: “If my business could talk, what would it say?”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can have a crappy product and still become über successful.

The product does not have the money, though. The product does not care who owns it. The customer has the money. The customer has a specific problem and unmet needs that she wants addressed. She is searching for a solution and someone to do business with that will meet or even exceed her expectations. The primary key to growth is to fall in love with the customer, not the product. (See “Mommas Love Their Babies” if you need more convincing.)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The most common reason businesses fail to grow is not that they aren’t adding enough new customers; it’s that they aren’t keeping the customers they’ve got.</li>\n<li>Don’t believe me? Ask yourself this question: “How big would my business be if I still had every customer who ever tried me?”</li>\n<li>If your growth initiatives are exclusively focused on how to get new customers to try you, you are not focused on meeting and exceeding your current customers’ needs and expectations. Adding a new customer is great if you simultaneously keep all your existing customers. But adding a new customer and losing an existing customer is a strategy for treading water and getting tired.</li>\n<li>Keeping customers can be boiled down to three things:\n<ul>\n<li>a. <strong>FOWTW - Find Out What They Want.</strong> Customers do not really care about what you want to sell them, nor do they care how much you love your product. Customers care about having their needs met. The customer gets to define success. We make a mistake when we assume that the genius of our product and our “passion” for our idea are THE most important things. <strong>The genius of a great business is a maniacal focus on the customer and his outcomes, frustrations, and success.</strong> Steve Jobs said it best: “One of the things I’ve always found is that you’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You can’t start with the technology and try to figure out where you’re going to try to sell it.”</li>\n</ul>\nb. <strong>GAGI - Go and Get It</strong>. After you are clear about the pain, frustration, needs, and expectations of your customers, your job as a business Owner is to find the pain reliever (solution) that meets their outcomes and definition of success. This means designing a solution that specifically addresses your target market’s problem in a way that is meaningfully different from what is currently available.\nc. <strong>GITT - Give It to Them.</strong> It does no good to find out what customers want, to go and get it, and then not to deliver it to them. GITT is really about the “how” you do it, not the “what” you do. You can give someone a great tasting meal, but an inattentive waiter (or an overly attentive one who interrupts your conversations) will spoil the evening. Alternatively, you can receive an average meal, but the service, atmosphere, and ambiance are so outstanding, the evening is a stupendous success.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Increase Referrals and Repeats:</strong> Here’s a question for you: Name me one business that could survive a year without any referrals or repeat business. It’s hard to do. I have found that most business owners get so excited about adding new customers they fail to appreciate and show the love to their existing ones. Why offer discounts only to people who have never tried you before? The customers that have been paying our bills for the last ten years are the ones we should be bending over backwards to take care of.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sustainable growth requires two things: keeping the customers you’ve got, and adding new ones.</strong></li>\n<li>A great growth question that will help you get clarity on this idea is this: <strong>“How would you run your business if 100% of your future growth was by referral and repeat business only?”</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Define and Enhance Certainty of Success:</strong> The clichés “add more value” and “value proposition” are incredibly overused by marketing experts to describe what your business should deliver to your customers and, thereby, differentiate yourself from your competition. I think about this concept a different way … <strong>a “success proposition.” What has to happen to give your customers certainty of success?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Your customers get to define success, not you. They don’t really care about what you want to sell them or how excited you are about your product. At the end of the transaction, they just want to be able to say, “Yes!!! That’s exactly what I wanted and I loved it… I’ll be back!” The fundamental success proposition question you should design your business around, especially if you are interested in growth, is: “What has to happen so the customer will say ‘I’d have to be crazy to do business with someone else!”?”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Enhance/Train the Sales Process: Most amateurs in business, especially in sales, attempt to “wing it” when it comes to the sales process and presentation. This is a truly bad idea because you will always produce inconsistent results and have no clue what is causing them.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The best people in the world at sales and sales training have a formula, a script, a process, or a recipe they use. They rehearse and practice that process… repeatedly. They rehearse simulated sales processes, ask the toughest questions, raise the worst objections, and then design answers and responses to all of them.</li>\n<li><strong>Mastery = Practicing the right thing in an effort to get better. When the training stops, so does the progress. Candidly, I have found that I am not talented or smart enough to be unprepared.</strong></li>\n<li>Attempting to get more leads before training or retraining on the sales process is likely to result in wasted money and burnt leads.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Increase Conversion Percentage: Obviously, if you get the same number of leads but do a better, more consistent job of closing them, your sales will increase. We know we want to increase the number of customers we have. The low-hanging fruit solution is to increase the closing percentage. If you are currently closing 25% of your leads, a 5% increase in your close ratio is the equivalent of increasing your leads by 20%. (Increasing your conversion or closing ratio is dependent on the training idea outlined immediately above in #4.)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Increase Transaction Size:</strong> Sometimes we have multiple products or services that can be packaged together. When the price of the package is less than the total of the à la carte prices, customers perceive a deal and tend to buy the bigger (higher-priced) package. This is the McDonald’s theme of “Do you want fries with that?”</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps you can offer a high-margin, low-cost “bonus” of an ancillary product or service, which would enable you to increase your overall price to the customer but incur relatively minor increases in your expenses.</li>\n<li><strong>Increasing revenue and sabotaging profits is a formula for poor.</strong></li>\n<li>The central idea is to design a package that will, for example, increase revenue by 10% and increase profits by 15%. Sometimes the transaction value can be increased with something as simple as a modest price increase. If you have a 10% profit margin, a 2% price increase will have the same bottom line impact on profits as a 20% increase in revenue.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Increase Frequency:</strong> Many successful businesses increase the frequency of customer purchase by helping the customer see the value of shopping exclusively with them. A rewards or frequent buyer program is often used for this purpose. Southwest Airlines does not expect you to fly more frequently as a result of their frequent flyer program, but they are incentivizing you to fly with them when you book those next tickets. Loyalty is very powerful because it drives repeat business. Repeat business does not have the usual customer acquisition costs and, therefore, is much more profitable.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>Increase Leads/Drive Traffic:</strong> You will immediately notice that this link in the Growth Funnel chain is last on the list. The reason is because it is usually the highest-hanging fruit and consequently the most difficult to attain. In most circumstances, the first seven strategies to impact the top line should be executed and optimized prior to allocating resources to drive the number of leads.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimize before you maximize.</strong></li>\n<li>No one likes to hear this message, because designing websites, writing advertising copy, devising PR campaigns, and creating social media strategies are way more fun and exciting than working on sales scripts, referrals, and repeat business.</li>\n<li>When the time is right to work on increasing leads and driving traffic, it is critical to optimize for quality, not quantity. We do not need more eyeballs or visitors to our website; we need to reach our target market with a compelling message.</li>\n<li>Getting big is the result of success. Success is not the result of getting big. One of your jobs is to carefully consider the various strategies available to you for growing your business. Lurching for the “more leads” lever is rarely the best or most effective alternative.</li>\n<li>A word of caution: Developing a strategy to grow revenue is important, but growing revenue without growing profits and cash flow is dumb. Successful businesses have figured out how to do both. (“Correcting the Business Model” describes the nuts and bolts of this process.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep More Customers</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why do people buy from me in the first place?

So, now you must invest this cash someplace (usually someplace you know very little about) to receive a return, and few returns can match the cash flow of the business you just sold.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Picture this. Suppose your business produced $1,000,000/year of earnings. And assume businesses in your industry are typically valued at four times the earnings because the industry has a higher- than-average predictability and sustainability of future earnings. And imagine that your specific business was unusually attractive and, therefore, commanded a premium multiple of five times earnings. You sell the business, receive $5.0 million cash (assuming your buyer is a cash buyer-an extremely unlikely assumption when dealing with smaller businesses), and now you pay taxes of 20%. Let’s assume the taxes are $1.0 million. You now have a remaining balance of $4.0 million that needs to be invested and somehow receive a $1,000,000 annual return (that’s a 25% annual rate of return) to match what you were making before.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regardless of the decision to sell or not, the path to maximizing the enterprise value and creating exitability remains the same: Grow the earnings and control risks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The things that can go wrong are the things that jeopardize the enterprise value and exitability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some risks are identifiable by studying a business’s financial statements, which is what my CFO Scoreboard® (available at <a href=\"http://www\">http://www</a> .CFOScoreboard.com) is designed to do. Some risks are embedded in the structure or framework of the business and are hard to identify by looking only at the numbers. Other risks are environmental (e.g., the economy) and are, by their very nature, uncontrollable, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they are unmanageable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The following is a description of the six critical “non-financial statement” risks an Owner and his management team must address (and continue to monitor) to increase the predictability and sustainability of the future stream of earnings and thus maximize the enterprise value and exitability of the business.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Concentration Risk: A business that produces $50,000,000 of profits is not necessarily a healthy or even an exitable business. If it has 10,000 customers and one of those customers accounts for 75% of its revenue and profits, this business is in serious jeopardy of failing. This is called concentration risk, and it happens when the business is too reliant on any one customer, supplier, distribution channel, account receivable, referral source, strategic partner, IT, employee, or Owner. Another way of describing concentration risk is single- point-of-failure risk, meaning that if only one thing goes wrong, Humpty Dumpty can hit the concrete.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Buyers are uncomfortable with concentration risks and therefore ratchet the purchase price down or simply pass on buying your business. For the majority of small businesses, the Owner is the most significant single-point-of-failure risk, which explains their low exit valuations and difficulty in selling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Sustainability Risks: Buyers of businesses are buying the future stream of earnings. Any risk that could disrupt those future earnings impacts the sustainability of the business and therefore minimizes the enterprise value. The greater the risk (or the greater the number of risks), the less the value.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>What could disrupt the future stream of earnings? This question goes to the heart of risk analysis and is an extremely important question for all owners to think about. Earnings are a result of revenues minus expenses, so the question I am really asking is: “What could cause revenues to tumble or expenses to soar?” This is a simple question, but it requires serious thought and candor. A business that lacks a clear, sustainable path to profitability is a business that is difficult to exit at any price. Hint: <strong>Do not confuse sustainability with stability. Volatility is not synonymous with risk.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Business Model Risks: A business model is the structure of how a business makes money and reveals whether or not the amount made is adequate to compensate the investors for the risks they take. Embedded within this definition are lots of unseen but vital assumptions about the target market, pricing, competition, quality of products, distribution channels, performance guarantees, asset acquisitions, resource allocation, staffing requirements, capital structure… and the list goes on.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>All business models are subject to both internal and external pressures, which will require you to bend and sometimes break your own model to remain competitive and relevant in the marketplace. You and I both know of businesses that relied on a page-one Google ranking for their primary marketing. The instant Google changed its algorithms, the ranking and the customers vaporized. Google can be risky, too.</li>\n<li>Understanding the threats to and weaknesses of your business model is imperative to creating a sustainable and exitable business.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>External Risks: All businesses operate in an environment and are therefore subject to external risks. Something can always go wrong, and often these bad things are not only external to the business but also things we have zero control over. External risks might include your competition, a hatchet job by the crew of 60 Minutes, a regulatory change, China’s GDP slowing down, interest rates skyrocketing, or a repeat of the 2008 economic meltdown. Some of these risks might be manageable, but most are probably uncontrollable. Whether the risk is internal or external, manageable or uncontrollable, it is vital that you identify these risks early on and keep your eye on them.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Leverage Risk: Adding debt to any financial structure adds risk. When businesses borrow money, the underlying emotion is optimism. More often than not, the money is originally borrowed to facilitate some growth opportunity the management team has identified. And, rather than give up equity, and thereby spread the risk (and the upside if it works), we get greedy.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The belief is that this money can be borrowed and deployed with returns that will meet certain size and timing assumptions. When those assumptions turn out to be wrong and the profits are delayed or less than anticipated, the burden of that excessive optimism comes home to roost.</li>\n<li>Too much debt stresses cash and cash flow, which ultimately endangers the viability of the business. Interest payments must be made. Loans must be repaid. Covenants must be met. When interest payments, loan repayments, and covenants are missed, management spends its time in workout meetings with the lender instead of running and growing the business. If the debt is severe enough, the existence of the business is threatened. Understanding the debt structure, interest rates, debt maturities, debt service requirements and capabilities, and robustness of lender relationships is crucial for all business owners. Making sure there are adequate cash reserves to fund future debt repayment obligations is mandatory.</li>\n<li>To help me avoid excessive optimism, over-leveraging, and the dreaded dumb tax, I use a simple formula I call the Power of 3.\na. What’s the upside? (I am pretty good at this one, and so are you.)\nb. What’s the downside? (We rarely think this one through, because we ignore risks.)\nc. Can I live with the downside? (Only the pros ask this question, which is why they are rich.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Excess Capacity Risk: Like all machines, businesses are comprised of integrated parts. It does no good to have an engine that can go 300 mph if the suspension can only handle 100 mph. The extra 200 mph of horsepower under the hood are a waste. Similarly, every business has underutilized assets or excess production capability that can be made more productive, outsourced, or eliminated from the business’s cost or capital structure. Examples might include staff, inventory, excessive receivables, production capability, knowledge, strategic relationships, expertise, office or warehouse space, alliances, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>A key component of running the business end of your business is correctly identifying where the business should allocate its resources. If resources are idle or lacking in productivity, a great business Owner will strike immediately and remedy this waste.</li>\n<li>The myth that entrepreneurs are risk-takers is misguided. The entrepreneurs you read about in the Wall Street Journal and Forbes magazine have taken calculated risks. They understood what could go wrong, had a “Plan B,” and managed their business to minimize the probability and cost in the event of a mistake.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minimizing the internal and external risks and how these risks impact the predictability and sustainability of your future stream of earning is critical to the value of your business and your ultimate exitability as an Owner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the concentration risks in our business?</li>\n<li>Where are we exposed if we lose a key person or relationship?</li>\n<li>What could disrupt our revenue, customer acquisition, repeat business, or referrals?

Eisenhower said on this subject: “In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The reality is that a plan is a series of assumptions about future events and anticipated activities, which is why plans rarely come off without a hitch. We can’t know the future. Either the environment shifts or the activities performed were faulty or inadequate. Our assumptions about both are invariably wrong, and therefore the results ultimately produced are different than anticipated. So, why do it? Because the value is not in the plan. The value is in the planning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being intimate with how all the pieces are interconnected and which levers drive specific results is the key to knowing what to adjust when things get off course or delayed. Among the host of issues critical to planning are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>understanding your current situation;</li>\n<li>describing the clear outcome desired;</li>\n<li>defining the specific obstacles preventing the attainment of this outcome;</li>\n<li>designing and anticipating the various activities to be performed;</li>\n<li>knowing the environment you are operating in;</li>\n<li>evaluating the competition’s strengths and weaknesses;</li>\n<li>studying the consumer/target market’s unfulfilled needs and frustrations and identifying the exact problem these specific consumers/target market want solved;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Business owners make three big mistakes when it comes to planning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>The most common mistake is substituting a description of the destination for a road map —a plan of exactly and specifically how we are going to get from Point A to Point B.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The second most common mistake is falling in love with the dream-the destination itself. An obsession with the dream obscures your ability to see whether or not there’s a demand for it.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The third most common mistake is creating a ten-year plan, which is crazy. It is never really a plan but rather an idea… a dream… wishful thinking (which usually takes the form of projected hockey-stick growth and profits based on quadrupling customers on a compound basis with no thought to how that magic trick is performed). The reality is that too many things are happening way too fast with too many competitors and changes in the environment to predict future financial performance that far in advance. Most business owners I know would be better off with a ten-year commitment than a ten-year “plan.”</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The value of planning is the clarity of being able to explain your strategy and blueprint to increase your level of financial success in the current environment, which is very different from being able to explain how the current environment has impacted your level of financial success. One is planning and the other is a justification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Here are some problems with no planning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are in a constant state of reacting to the problem du jour… Whack-a-Mole. If you are reacting, you’re too late… and tired.</li>\n<li>Like Christopher Columbus, you will not know where you are going, where you are when you get there, or where you have been when it’s over.</li>\n<li>You have nothing to flicker against to measure your progress, or to measure the changes in the environment and what needs to be adjusted to get back on track.</li>\n<li>This is where budgets enter the conversation. A budget is simply a set of assumptions about the timing and execution of certain activities performed in a certain environment and translating these activities into financial assumptions. The primary reason why all large successful businesses have budgets is to give the management team optics about how the company is performing in comparison to how it was projected to perform. Using these optics, management can now make the necessary course corrections to get back on track.</li>\n<li>You do not know your resource and critical driver interdependencies to be able to make the midcourse correction adjustments necessary to navigate the inevitable storms, detours, roadblocks, and punches in the nose.</li>\n<li>You are executing on an idea if there is no plan, which never ends well. A flurry of tactical activities to move the needle is the formula for drama and chaos.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edward Deming (the godfather of quality and process management) put it this way: “If you can’t describe the plan or the process to achieve that plan, you don’t know what you are doing.” Smart man.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you cannot get clarity on the plan to achieve the outcome, change the outcome. Even with a plan, you probably will not hit the bull’s-eye, but at least you will not end up in a graveyard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Am I currently executing an idea or a plan? If it is an idea, what does the plan need to look like?</li>\n<li>Where have I let my ideas become a substitute for my quarterly and annual plans?</li>\n<li>Since a plan is always executable, do I know which actions to perform next week, next month, next quarter to move the needle toward my outcome?</li>\n<li>Does my team know what they are supposed to be doing to help us get from here to there? If so, what is that… specifically?</li>\n<li>Where are my current results deviating from my plan and what are the critical driver performance metrics that must be monitored in light of this variance?</li>\n<li>How does my budget vs. actual financial comparison stack up?</li>\n<li>Were there some faulty assumptions in my current plan? Where?</li>\n<li>Was I overly optimistic about the time frames? Where?</li>\n<li>Has the environment changed and thereby rendered my original plan obsolete? If so, where and what needs to be done about it?</li>\n<li>Was the original plan a good one and the problem is a lack of consistent execution? If so, where?</li>\n<li>Where is the gap between my plan and our results a reflection of a mediocre team or weak players?</li>\n<li>Is the team sound but the problem is a lousy culture or a lack of training? Where?</li>\n<li>Maybe the training is good, but the problem is that no one is measuring the critical drivers and taking immediate corrective action?

A far bigger problem is that you don’t do what you do know.” We tend to always be on the lookout for some new, hot idea that will get us from Point A to Point B quicker and easier, with less effort and sweat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you stop to think about it, what gets us into trouble and causes most of our problems (and dumb tax) is our genetic coding to look for the easiest path to success. Our biggest problems are a result of a never-ending quest to find the path of least resistance instead of a commitment to do whatever it takes to achieve the desired outcome. You can’t commit if you are still looking, and most of us are looking for the easier way. We seem to be addicted to “keeping our options open”… to find a way that is less painful or requires less sacrifice… a way that enables us to be passive and still be rich.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Everyone wants to go to heaven, no one wants to die. There is no success without sacrifice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The reality is that most of us would be much farther along if we simply asked ourselves the question, “What can I do today to improve my situation?” and then picked up the shovel and started digging where we are while simultaneously learning new skills and tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>I read two or three books a week and have for almost thirty years. I attend seminars and listen to audiotapes constantly. My personal library is immense.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But I have also learned that education without execution (i.e., getting things done) is “shelf help.” If I don’t apply the techniques, strategies, and distinctions I am learning, I will make no forward progress. To achieve my outcomes, I need to get started by doing something. I need to break a sweat. You will find the same principle is true about this book: read it and do the work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being addicted to learning is critical to success… but so is being addicted to the business end of a shovel.

You can’t shift priorities without simultaneously shifting resources.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Without prioritization of the outcomes there is no prioritization of activities; therefore, resources get consumed in a frantic attempt to do everything instead of the most meaningful thing. Mismanaging this relationship between priorities and resources has filled many business graveyards. Multitasking is stupid at the CEO/Owner/Board level of a business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In my Board of Directors, our tradition is to plan and think in terms of one “major” and two or three “minors” for the upcoming quarter. A major priority is a very important outcome or project that is being elevated off our To-Do list and will now receive enough calendar time, bandwidth, and resources to make measurable progress. It is the thing that, if focused on and accomplished, would have the greatest significant impact on the business in the coming ninety days. A minor is important (not as important as a major), but still qualifies for elevated time, focus, and attention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My experience has been that figuring out the most important outcome or project is actually one of the hardest parts of this exercise. We tend to default into thinking that lots of things are important and that narrowing our priorities down to just a few is impossible or unrealistic, given all the stuff that needs attention. Let me assure you it’s not. <strong>My rule is: Start fewer things, finish more things.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remember this critical distinction when you are setting priorities (and shifting resources accordingly): Vague, glossy majors or minors are useless. “I will improve the revenues in the next quarter” is a meaningless statement, because there are no metrics or specifics attached to it that show how the outcome will be achieved.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The great question is: “What am I optimizing for?” In other words, what is the one major that, if accomplished, would have the most significant impact on my business?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What am I optimizing for?</li>\n<li>What one meaningful, specific outcome, if I achieved it, would have a significant positive impact on my business?</li>\n<li>What are the specific obstacles standing in my way of making measurable progress on this outcome?</li>\n<li>What specific activities must I prioritize to make measurable progress toward this outcome?</li>\n<li>What resources would need to be acquired or reconfigured to move the needle on this priority?</li>\n<li>What are the three most significant things I could do this week that would kick the can and close the gap by moving me closer to my major priority?</li>\n<li>What are three things I would need to stop doing to make room for this major priority? How do I regain control of my calendar and minimize the “got-a-minute” interruptions that are sabotaging my time?</li>\n<li>How much time should I spend thinking about what I need to prioritize and spend time on? . If I am raising my standards by prioritizing my majors, activities, and deliverables, how might I enroll my senior leadership team in this process as well? (You will be stunned by their accountability and the progress people can make when they have clarity about their majors and minors and what they are optimizing for.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"advice-from-the-chairman-of-the-board\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#advice-from-the-chairman-of-the-board\" aria-label=\"advice from the chairman of the board permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>ADVICE FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It turns out that the key to getting rich is to avoid doing stupid things. The vast majority of dumb tax in both of our lives is a direct result of emotional and optimistic decisions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operators react and sweat. Owners think and plan.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The player on the field in a football game must get psychologically jacked up and mentally erase any doubts about the ultimate domination by his team over the opponent. Mental belief and optimism are critical to high performance on the gridiron.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The pregame and halftime locker room pep talks are designed to get the players into a “peak state” so they will perform at the highest level. In a football game, the players are the doers, the performers, and they must get amped up to excel at their job. Igniting this excitement and passion is a critical ingredient to ensure their success on the field. An Operator of a business is fueled by this same exuberance, hubris, and extreme confidence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Owner of the football team, however, should never be one of the people sitting in the locker room listening to the halftime pep talk in an effort to decide whether or not to add fifteen new luxury box suites to the stadium next year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Owner of the team must be strategic (not emotionally tactical) in his thinking. He must consider the overall game plan, the key personnel on the bench, and who is injured or has recently struggled to perform, as well as the weaknesses on the opponent’s bench.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Owner must mentally plan for an astonishing number of hypothetical what-if scenarios that might arise during the game. And this doesn’t include the stadium naming rights, the number of season tickets sold, whether the cash flow of the business is sufficient to meet payroll this month, how much money is being returned to the investors for the risk they took, and all the things that could go wrong that would eat his leg off.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the Owner of the team made his decisions by first sitting through a pep rally from a motivational coach, we would have a very enthusiastic Owner with no money. No exceptions. Owners and members of a Board of Directors do not work themselves into an emotional frenzy prior to a Board meeting. Ever!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most business owners and entrepreneurs experience a major shock when confronted with the advice and counsel of a true Board of Directors. A Board does not care how optimistic you are or how much you believe in yourself or whether or not your product is your passion or life’s purpose. A great Board knows that exciting stories, inclusion on the list of Inc. 500 fastest-growing companies, first-mover advantage, Entrepreneur of the Year awards, and projected hockey stick returns are the breakfast of the membership director of a fraternity, not a seasoned CEO. Check your medals and your ego at the door. Business is personal, but not emotional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At the Owner and Board levels, success is not contingent on excessive enthusiasm on the field but rather by the quality of the planning, preparation, risk assessment, and risk mitigation strategies. Thinking about 2nd-order consequences and unrealistic assumptions is mandatory. Skepticism and thinking are your best friends when sitting in the Owner’s box.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Here is the distinction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a group of operators get together, it’s called a convention. You will have a great time, everyone will yuk it up, party all night, give each other awards, plaques, and standing ovations for being so successful. This stuff might massage your ego and make you feel good, but none of it will make you rich. Attempting to make a business decision while wearing the Artist or Operator hat will result in stupid (see “The 4 Hats of Business”).</li>\n<li>When a group of business owners get together, it’s called a Board meeting. The goal of a Board is to help you think through the risks and possible 2nd-order consequences, thereby minimizing the likelihood of you doing something stupid.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The single most toxic poison in business is excessive emotion. Emotions and intellect work inversely. As I said at the start of The Road Less Stupid, when emotion goes up, intellect goes down.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Every business is just one bad decision away from a financial disaster. Look no farther than Lehman Brothers: 130 years old; $1.4 trillion in assets; gone in 90 days because of one stupid decision… and numerous unexamined assumptions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Over the long term, the amount of net worth on the balance sheet or money in the bank is determined more by the number and size of the losses incurred and less by the number or size of the winners hit. There is always uncertainty and, therefore, risks. In business, an addiction to certainty is rarely your friend. Assessing and controlling risk (which is paramount to financial success) is only possible by thinking through key risk related questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the risks we are facing? Really!</li>\n<li>What is the probability of these risks occurring?</li>\n<li>How costly are these risks should they occur?</li>\n<li>How can we control or mitigate the probability or the cost?</li>\n<li>Where have we substituted optimism for risk assessment in our business and thinking? . What assumptions have I made about our future that might not be true, and if they ultimately proved to be untrue, what contingency plans do I need to develop today to ensure survival if I am wrong?</li>\n<li>Where have I let my emotions and need for more interfere with my judgment?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What we achieved in the past is a poor predictor of what we will achieve in the future. I am certain Netscape, Atari, AltaVista, Polaroid, and JC Penny would agree with me that the rules and the environment are always changing. People who are impressed with their prior success or who crave fame and applause rarely make the changes required to be relevant in the future. Leadership requires humility. No humility, no learning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use a Thinking Time session or two in deep thought about the future and where you are being lulled to sleep by past success:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where have I extrapolated past performance as a predictor for future results?</li>\n<li>Where have we confused applause for past performance with future financial success?</li>\n<li>Where have we allowed our past success to lull us into believing we are bulletproof?</li>\n<li>What business decisions do we need to make to ensure our future viability?</li>\n<li>Given the current marketplace landscape, which part of our business needs to be reinvented?</li>\n<li>Where are our results diminishing even though we are still doing what we used to? In light of this assessment, what needs to change?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being aggressive with expansion is always risky, especially when a stable foundation is not in place, the management team is not solid, or you are relying on the capital structure (excessive debt) to produce the returns required. Doubling the horsepower of the engine in your car or substituting rocket fuel for your unleaded gas will not enable the car to go two times faster. Scaling mediocrity produces bigger piles of mediocrity, not success. Always optimize first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All business owners want to grow, but few have the discipline to create a sound platform for that growth prior to pouring in the jet fuel. Contrary to popular opinion, the solution to the vast majority of business problems has little to do with the size of the top line.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Growth is what you say “yes” to. Success is what you say “no” to. The hardest thing in business is figuring out what to say “no” to. Warren Buffett said it best: “The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no to almost everything.”</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expanding prematurely is a prescription for disaster, especially if the expansion is funded by excessive debt. Leverage magnifies the results but does nothing to change the fundamental risk characteristics of the investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One final point on this: Scaling a hand-crank process does not result in more bottom-line profits. It results in more “crankers.” Scaling when the lug nuts on a Formula One race car are not tight or there’s not a process/culture to keep them tight results in wrecks, not success. Automating, systematizing, or scaling weakness is the foundation for misery and failure. Before you stomp on the gas, think through the following questions to make sure the chassis, springs, and shocks can withstand the torque:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When I take a hard look at my expansion and growth plans, do we have a base that is rock- solid, or are we relying on a rising tide and calm waters?</li>\n<li>Does my team have the bandwidth required to continue to do the job they are currently doing plus handle the incremental growth and new customers I am projecting? (See “Indigestion (1+12)” for more on this issue.)</li>\n<li>Where have I allowed our enthusiasm for our ideas to be a substitute for a solid, executable plan?</li>\n<li>The first step in self-delusion is denial. Where are we running with scissors? (My observations in “Creating Enterprise Value” are particularly germane in this regard.)</li>\n<li>Risks and facts don’t cease to exist just because I ignore them, and thinking that risk is under control is the greatest risk there is. Risk analysis requires extreme humility (overconfidence is the enemy) and the courage to admit not knowing what you don’t know. What are the Top 10 risks we are facing and what can we do to mitigate the cost or probability of each risk identified? (“Not All Risks Are Created Equal” takes a thorough look at accessing and managing risk.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We all have limited resources. It is impossible to attempt to do everything we think of or take advantage of every opportunity that presents itself. As CEO, your job is to carefully and selectively prioritize the few key strategies and initiatives that will optimize the financial performance of the business while simultaneously leveraging the resources available. Prioritize the things that aren’t in place but, if they were, would make the biggest difference to the business. (Both “The Great Question” and “A CEO Should Never Delegate…” gave you solid advice about how, when, and what to prioritize.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are we optimizing for?</li>\n<li>What is my major outcome?</li>\n<li>Where have we spread ourselves too thin by attempting to do too much?</li>\n<li>Which activities or initiatives need to be stopped or paused so that we can concentrate on the most critical strategies and stabilize/grow our business?</li>\n<li>What are the underutilized resources in my business and how can I best put those resources (strengths) to work?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It takes courage and trust for a CEO to engage with a Board of Directors. Sometimes even great CEOs will be tempted to sugarcoat or disguise the issues in an attempt to appear capable and strong. Courage is a key ingredient for leadership. In fact, every failure of leadership has at its root a lack of courage. Courage to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>say what needs to be said;</li>\n<li>ask for advice;</li>\n<li>admit mistakes and errors in judgment;</li>\n<li>make the difficult decisions and have the hard conversations;</li>\n<li>listen with the intent to understand, not the intent to justify or reply;</li>\n<li>initiate change; and</li>\n<li>face reality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I lacked courage forty years ago with my first Board of Directors. I was afraid to ask for advice because I erroneously believed that exposing my doubts and anxieties were signs of incompetence. But I had it all wrong. The Board meetings weren’t all about me. They were all about the business. And it was crucial that anything and everything that could possibly have an impact on the life, the survival of the business needed to be brought to the table. I’ve since realized these truths about the necessity of communicating with a Board:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Board of Directors is neither a cheerleader nor a critic. Board members are “partners” and collaborators in designing success. A Board acts as an advisor and counselor for a CEO. Board members poke, ask questions, and prod as they look for icebergs, unexamined assumptions, and wishful thinking.</li>\n<li>A Board never thinks about opportunities without simultaneously thinking about the risks, probabilities, downsides, costs, and trade-offs associated with those opportunities.</li>\n<li>A Board knows that what kills the business is not missing an opportunity but rather unseen risks. Boards think in terms of 2nd-order consequences and ensuring survival (in the event things turn ugly) rather than a financial bonanza if everything goes as planned). (Reread Core Discipline #4-Consider 2nd-Order Consequences in “The 5 Core Disciplines of Thinking” to appreciate the importance of this point.)</li>\n<li>A Board of Directors knows that a plan that requires you to dodge all the bullets to be successful is not a plan; it’s a hallucination.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use these Thinking Time questions to get greater clarity about some decisions you need to make for your business:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who do I have around me that I can count on to question my assumptions and ask me the tough questions?</li>\n<li>Who will tell me what I don’t want to hear?</li>\n<li>Who on my team will tell me “no”?</li>\n<li>Where are we relying on a perfect environment or flawless execution to create the success we are predicting?</li>\n<li>Where am I allowing a lack of courage to dictate my decisions?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I have found in my forty-five-year business career that the majority of my mistakes (losses) were a result of unexamined assumptions and tolerating an inferior team/culture that did not execute consistently. I sometimes relied too heavily on the brilliance of my idea. I did not pay close enough attention to the risks, which created even more risk because I went all in when I should have folded or checked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I erroneously believed that the higher the risk, the higher the reward, which is just plain stupid. The correct statement is this: The higher the risk, the greater the likelihood of a loss, not a reward.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I mistook luck for skill and extrapolated my past performance as an accurate predictor of my future success. I did not surround myself with smart people who were strong enough to disagree with me. My fatal flaw was the illusion that I am somehow special and could beat the odds with my sheer determination, sweat, and brainpower. Dumb!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Business is an intellectual sport. We make the mistake of believing we can somehow get rich or become successful by</p>\n<ul>\n<li>being passionate enough;</li>\n<li>wanting it desperately enough;</li>\n<li>visualizing it long enough;</li>\n<li>believing that we are entitled enough;</li>\n<li>being talented enough; and/or</li>\n<li>working hard enough.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It doesn’t work that way. Passion and desire might produce a willingness to persist, but they do not teach the skills and tools to create the success. The advice (and book) Do What You Love and the Money Will Follow is as stupid as it is destructive. This is analogous to saying, “Eat What You Want and Be Skinny.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Doing what you love might make you feel fulfilled. It might make a great hobby or pastime. You might feel energized and excited. You might make a huge contribution, but simply loving to do something will not create business or financial success.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the other hand, hating what you do is not a prescription for success either. Don’t miss my point here: I am not arguing for or against being passionate about what you do; I am just pointing out that passion alone is not the one-trick pony for business success.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sustainably successful business Owners play the game with their heads, not their emotions. It’s chess, not checkers.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The people who sustainably win at business excel at sorting out and managing the risks. They do not have their lips securely attached to their own exhaust pipes to keep themselves jacked up emotionally on hopium, excitement, and a naive conviction that if they are just certain enough, they can achieve their dreams through sheer willpower, passion, and belief.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Here is the real “secret”: <strong>The chance of success goes up when you think, plan, consistently execute the right things, and worry about the possibility of loss.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"one-last-thing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#one-last-thing\" aria-label=\"one last thing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>ONE LAST THING</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Pleasure is about stimulating the senses.

We tend to be astonishingly optimistic in our thinking and plans. The initial optimism and subsequent problems are closely linked. The culprit is not having enough wise voices in the conversation.</p>\n<p>When I look at the majority of my problems, the common denominator was having only one voice in my head when the decision was made… mine. The truth is, adding additional voices to the conversation (advice, counsel, best practices, tough questions, optics, insights, and wisdom from other smart people) is mandatory if we expect to achieve our full potential and maximize our results. Without the advice and additional voices, we commit the most fatal of mistakes going the wrong direction enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>We both have had the experience of getting stuck, being confused and uncertain about which decision must be made or what direction to take to best optimize our results. One of the outcomes of a Board is to provide clarity and act as a sounding board for its members. Too many entrepreneurs and business owners rely on the formula of “My Idea My Experience.” Unfortunately, this formula is a prescription for disaster. Everyone needs the benefit of fresh insights and the best practices of other business people who bring new perspectives and ideas to our problems.</p>\n<p>A sustainably successful business requires an additional set of discriminating eyes to help identify the risks and 2nd-order consequences of our decisions and plans. We need optics and insights to identify areas where</p>\n<p>we could be structured differently or restructured and streamlined so we can grow and optimize our results. My view is that all of us need as many ideas as possible about the challenges we are facing. In fact, my experience is this: The best way to have a great idea is to have a lot of ideas and then to pick the best one. I intend to contribute to both.\nAs you may or may not know, I have extensive and significant experience in doing this kind of work, most of which involves $3 million to $150 million/ year businesses. I have been the CEO and/or founder as well as the hired-gun turnaround expert for numerous (>20) businesses in multiple industries, so I am confident about the impact I will have on your business decisions.</p>\n<p>One of the major keys to my success has been to surround myself with advisors who not only watch for obstacles, icebergs, detours, or looming problems but also tell me the truth and hold me accountable. Making plans and annual budgets is one thing, but the best business owners in the world are fanatics at measuring and accountability. If you don’t want to measure, you don’t want to be held accountable.</p>\n<p>One of the problems we all have in business is that since we created the machine we currently have, it is often difficult for us to see how to tweak or rebuild or reinvent our machine without the help of an outsider’s perspective so that we can produce superior results. Further, environmental changes (the economy, competition, consumer preferences, regulations, etc.) can create states of disequilibrium that require an outside perspective to identify root problems/solutions that are virtually impossible for the Creator to see. Finally, every business has slippage, meaning that over time things just kind\nof evolve. One day you wake up and look at what you have created and decide this isn’t exactly what you intended, so a change is required.</p>\n<p>All business owners and entrepreneurs have a common problem: how to build a qualified group of advisors who will help counsel, watch, direct, set strategic direction, monitor execution, and progress toward the objectives and goals of the business as well as generate new ideas to build, grow, market, expand, and diversify their businesses. What most entrepreneurs end up with is either no advisors or a couple of local, well-known successful businesspeople who, if you’re lucky, agree to attend a couple of meetings per year to approve the minutes from the last meeting, the annual budgets, the new bank financing, the stock option plan, the officers’ annual compensation plan, and then adjourn, eat lunch, and play some golf. Not exactly what I need when I’m trying to run and optimize my businesses.</p>\n<p>Participating in a peer group setting and working on other people’s business problems is a great way to get clear on issues and ideas that will support you and your business. Our Board of Directors is designed to be your business advisors. I believe the most powerful business decision I ever made was to intentionally work with a peer group for advice, optics, and accountability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"process\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#process\" aria-label=\"process permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>PROCESS</h3>\n<p>At each Board meeting, each member (15 people/Board) will have an opportunity to present his or her business and its situation, opportunities, issues, and problems. Your Board, acting in an advisory capacity, will help you identify, evaluate, and resolve outstanding issues and problems, generate new ideas and solutions, avoid doing something stupid (the dreaded dumb tax), as well as hold you accountable for your plan as the year progresses. I will act as the moderator and Chairman for these discussions as well as be an active participant in all the discussions.</p>\n<p>Your Board will evaluate your numbers, your business plans, your marketing, your niche, and your team as well as help you identify new markets and growth opportunities. Nothing with respect to your business and its success will be off-limits. We will advise you on what we see that might be obstacles to your future growth and how you could significantly accelerate your progress and profits.

People who are not yet in business, need massive psychological counseling, are trying to figure out what to do with their life, or are interested in being “passive” are not candidates for the Board. This is not a seminar but rather a working business meeting in which we facilitate the discussion, growth, and sustainable optimization of each member’s business.</p>\n<p>You will be expected to take your participation very seriously. You will be expected to prepare and circulate an agenda and progress report for each meeting just like you would for any other critical business meeting. You will be expected to contribute to each of your fellow members’ discussions and to be active and thought-provoking in your participation. You will be expected to call it tight and say what needs to be said. I repeat: This is not a seminar. It is a business meeting at the highest level, so do not expect to be passive, to be spoon-fed, or to attend unprepared.</p>\n<p>The Board of Directors is not for the faint of heart, the “toe dippers,” or the undecided. If you know you require highly discriminating advice and counsel on an extremely personal and customized basis; if you want to dramatically grow your business and develop new strategies and execution techniques; if you know there are solutions to your problems but you don’t know which one is the best track for you and your business; if you need to generate new ideas and strategies; and if you know that being held accountable is THE key to your success; then the Board of Directors is the perfect opportunity!</p>\n<p>I know of no better way to maximize and optimize the financial results of your business than to surround yourself with a Board who will ask that you step up and play at the highest level for one year.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for your commitment to yourself and your growth and for your trust and confidence in me! I have been through this process numerous times with other people, so you will be in very good hands.</p>\n<p>I look forward to working with you at the highest level.</p>\n<h1 id=\"ceo-scorecard\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#ceo-scorecard\" aria-label=\"ceo scorecard permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>CEO SCORECARD</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The beauty of this kind of specificity and clarity is the opportunity it provides to coach performance and identify needed corrections.</li>\n<li>Create and lead our business so we are the “employer of choice” while maintaining the desired profitability targets.

Establish clear links between the company’s outcomes and an individual’s outcomes and results. Make sure each employee understands how they contribute to the company’s mission, outcomes, and results. Ensure that each leader, manager, and staff member has an outcomes-based scorecard that maps to the company’s outcomes and results. Plan and run meetings based on outcomes and results. Help design briefings, reports, agendas, and meeting materials that are focused on outcomes and results. Avoid allocating time to discussions of subjects such as activities, busyness, or hours worked.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be strategic in your thinking and tactical in your actions.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being clear on the problem, obstacle, or gap to be bridged is critical, since solving the problem that isn’t is a waste of time and resources (and, to be candid, irritates me). Developing a specific plan to overcome this obstacle is critical; otherwise, we run the risk of running the wrong direction enthusiastically. Finally, being tactical in your actions puts rubber on the road and facilitates forward progress.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Always be willing to ask the question “What can I do today to improve our situation?”</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Do not let perfect get in the way of possible. You might not have the final answer, but you can find two or three things to do to improve our current position. When in doubt, do these two or three things.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preserve relationships.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It really is a small world, and what comes around goes around.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be good at being both kind and driven.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Address everyone with kindness and consideration regardless of the topic at hand, even if the topic is missed expectations or poor performance. Demonstrate the ability to remain focused on outcomes and results while doing so in a manner that is attractive to our leaders, managers, and staff. Run and participate in meetings in a manner that elicits input from everyone. React to input and ideas in a way that makes people glad they spoke up and leads them to speak again. Make it clear to everyone around you that you actively desire input, new ideas, and feedback and that it will be used to actually make the company better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be a master at delegation, and do not abdicate your leadership.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be efficient and effective by delegating an outcome or result rather than an activity or a task. Ensure that the person clearly understands the outcome and the time frame in which the result is expected. Determine if the person responsible for delivering an outcome understands how to produce the result by working closely with them to develop their achievement plan. Provide coaching or training if needed and conduct periodic progress sessions. Stay close to the delegated task and remain part of the success of its achievement. Work with the person so they understand and accept the reasoning behind the delegated outcome and why they received it. It is important that they understand this even if they disagree with being the recipient of the delegated outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be physically present and involved.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get out of your office and spend face time with our staff. Get out of your office and spend face time physically with our customers. Make it a scheduled, embedded part of your calendar.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Attract, hire, develop, and retain only A players.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build our organization with A players. Demonstrate that you have proven ways to identify A-player talent and that you can teach this skill to other leaders. Demonstrate the ability to hire these A players into our company and how you can help them develop both personally and professionally. Show that you know how to retain this level of talent within our organization.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thrive in a competitive market.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand the competition as well as the marketplace (environment). Both change frequently. Understand our customers’ pains to avoid and gains to get criteria and how our business intersects with these vectors. Understand and proactively act on the risks, friction points, differences that make the difference, and success proposition criteria of both our existing customers as well as our marketplace.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Think</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend at least X hours per week in Thinking Time sessions with a high- quality question. While some of these questions will be tactical, the majority should be strategic and be based on bottlenecks, gaps in performance, leverage, underutilized assets, priorities, direction, and asset allocation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be successful and comfortable in a small business.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be comfortable acting on the old motto “No challenge is too large and yet no task is too small.” Be comfortable working in a small, tight-knit family of people all carrying multiple, simultaneous responsibilities. Demonstrate your understanding of the fact that you need these people far more than they need you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Make us better by learning lessons.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the company better with each event. We have the ability to learn from each success and failure. When an A player joins us, let’s learn why, and when an A player leaves, let’s learn why they made this decision. When a strategy works, let’s learn why; and when strategies fail, let’s figure out what went wrong and how we can avoid this mistake in the future. Create and oversee a company improvement initiative with expected results and actions as well as periodic follow-ups.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Leave your ego out.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your success will not be based on being right, righteous, or smart. Your success is measured by producing results, regardless of the source of the idea that produced them. Be humble and give the team the credit. After all, you are merely pointing the flashlight; they are doing all the digging.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be intelligent.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn fast and demonstrate the ability to quickly and proficiently understand and absorb new information. Be able to structure and process qualitative or quantitative data and draw insightful conclusions from it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Focus on your outcomes and results-produce.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly understand the outcomes and standards expected of you and your position. Commit to your outcomes, establish clear work plans (MBOs) to achieve each outcome, and measure yourself as well as your team. Know at all times if you are meeting your commitments, attaining your outcomes, and producing the value expected of you. Get and stay organized. Get and stay focused on your outcomes. Prioritize and operate with a major objective as the goal line. Be proactive and pay attention to detail. Avoid interesting activities (shiny pennies) that distract you from your outcomes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be flexible and adaptable.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>___ is a small business that is growing fast and expanding into new markets. Outcomes, standards, responsibilities, approaches, methodologies, and strategies will change from time to time-sometimes with your consent and approval; sometimes without. Be able to adjust quickly to changing priorities and conditions and be able to cope effectively with complexity and change.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Always invest in learning, growing, and improving yourself.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never be good enough. Never be smart enough. Never know all there is to know about leading, attracting new business, servicing our customers, or building the team. Demonstrate a continuous desire to learn by reading books (I read two to three per week), watching videos, attending seminars, and going to formal training. Be willing to spend your own money and your personal time in addition to the company’s. Demonstrate that you are participating in your own development, your own success, and your own growth. Visibly bring back what you learn to the company and teach others. Help others grow with you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"importance-of-capital-allocation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#importance-of-capital-allocation\" aria-label=\"importance of capital allocation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Importance of capital allocation</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The 8 CEOs studied in the book far outperformed the S&#x26;P 500 over a 20-30 year period and this is attributed to their capital allocation strategies. All CEOs are investors AND managers, but the ‘investors’ part is typically ignored. As Buffett says, capital allocation is one of the most important tasks of a CEO, yet almost none of the people who rise to be CEOs are trained for it. They rise to the top based on their engineering, marketing, sales or other skills.

Quarterly earnings reports are a distraction. This shapes company decisions including accounting policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Clever buy/sell of own stock:</strong> Buy-back own company’s stock aggressively when it is running low and attractively priced. Use the stock to finance acquisitions or get cheap debt when the stock price runs high. Stock repurchases are a more tax-efficient method of returning capital to shareholders than dividends, which are taxed twice (corporate and individual level).</li>\n<li><strong>Fly under the radar:</strong> Wall Street and the press are a distraction, ignore them. Great CEOs (as measured by return delivered in multiples over S&#x26;P 500) also avoid frequent magazine covers, interviews etc and fly under the radar.</li>\n<li><strong>Anorexic HQ:</strong> Run decentralized operations, with rigorous budget monitoring. Headquarters should be ‘anorexic’, with only enough staff as absolutely needed to support the general managers of the various business units. The GMs are given utmost authority and autonomy.</li>\n<li><strong>Traits as an investor:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Concentration:</strong> “Be comfortable with concentration and buy only a few things that you understand well.”</li>\n<li><strong>Patience:</strong> Be willing to wait long periods of time  (while the market complains about your inactivity), often a decade or more, for the right opportunity to emerge.</li>\n<li><strong>Boldness:</strong> Each of the 8 CEOs made at least one acquisition or more that exceeded 25% of their firm’s enterprise value.</li>\n<li><strong>Frugality &#x26; Tax Minimization</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on ‘value per share’:</strong> Do not shy away from shrinking the company if that is the best move. Most of corporate America focuses on growth, these 8 CEOs focused on increasing ‘value per share’.</li>\n<li><strong>Individualistic thinking:</strong> “Cut through the glare of peer activity and conventional wisdom to see the core economic reality and act accordingly.”</li>\n<li><strong>To sum it up, their advantage relative to their peers was one of temperament, not intellect.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"capital-cities-broadcasting---tom-murphy-and-dan-burke\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#capital-cities-broadcasting---tom-murphy-and-dan-burke\" aria-label=\"capital cities broadcasting   tom murphy and dan burke permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Capital Cities Broadcasting –  Tom Murphy and Dan Burke</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign of a well-run great company: Diaspora are all over the industry.

Warren Buffett helped finance the deal in exchange for a 25% stake in the combined company.</li>\n<li>Most companies fall into the trap of a ‘prosperity blinded indifference to unnecessary costs’. CC executives remained focused on the core businesses.</li>\n<li>Simple cycle that Tom Murphy used, which most people fail to remember or apply:\n<ul>\n<li>Look for attractive economic characteristics in a business or undertaking</li>\n<li>Use whatever leverage you can apply to get that attractive business</li>\n<li>Once you have it, improve operations.</li>\n<li>Use the cash flow from the improved operations to pay down debt.</li>\n<li>Rinse and repeat.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The above practice today is known as a ‘roll-up‘.

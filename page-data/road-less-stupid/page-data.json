I don’t need to do more smart things. I just need to do fewer dumb things. I need to avoid making emotional decisions and swinging at bad pitches. I need to think!</li>\n<li>All my problems started out as a good idea, and all those “good” ideas were emotionally justifiable at the time. Not only that, my current financial condition represents my very best “thinking.” Yours does, too.</li>\n<li>What sabotages our dreams and causes most of our problems (and ensuing dumb tax) is our excessive optimism and emotional belief in magic pills, secret formulas, and financial tooth fairies. (All balloons look good when they are filled with hot air.) Dumb!</li>\n<li>Emotions and intellect work inversely. When emotions go up, intellect goes down. Optimism is a deadly emotion in the business world. Warren Buffett said it best: “Optimism is the enemy of the rational investor.”</li>\n<li>There are no secrets … just stuff you haven’t learned yet.</li>\n<li>A business owner must knows that building a business is 80% an intellectual sport. Just like the great book by Napoleon hill says; Think and Grow Rich. Thinking is very essential to business growth. He who thinks deeper and wider wins the game. I dare say that Critical thinking is the name of the game. So where I am today is a product of my thinking or better still I am a product of how critical I think and analyze situations to make a decision. So every decision I make must take into consideration 2nd, 3rd and 4th order consequences when taking business decisions.</li>\n<li>John Maynard Keyes astutely said, “Most people, when confronted with a choice of changing their thoughts or proving there is no need to change, get busy on the proof.” I am so guilty of this. Whenever I have a knack or feeling that an idea would work, I would rather go ahead and find proof that it would work instead of looking at all the sides critically.</li>\n<li>“More often than not, critically thinking about what could go wrong and doing the work to mitigate those risks before taking action is abandoned in favor of comfort zones, the path of least resistance, and speed (instant gratification).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-discipline-of-thinking-time\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-discipline-of-thinking-time\" aria-label=\"the discipline of thinking time permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE DISCIPLINE OF THINKING TIME</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>There’s no such thing as natural business owner</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hard work trumps natural talent: Like the world renowned scientist, Albert Einstein said that being a genius is 99% hard work and 1% inspiration. You need to put in the necessary hard work before you get any result at all. Just like Keith put it so beautifully; Great business owners work hard, practice, study, test, think, correct and practice some more. There is no short cut. Period!! You must be committed to excellence and seek ways to do things better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>attempting to win the game of business by trial and error is about the stupidest way to learn anything</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never wing it: Most of us try to do this and hope that it will click, stick or have result. The issue with this is that it hardly succeeds and if it does you cannot repeat the process because you don’t have successive steps to show for it. So it’s not duplicable. Why would you do things by trial and error that would, in most times cost, you more in the long run, as opposed to take the necessary time to put into quality thinking to make better nosiness decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>running the wrong direction enthusiastically is stupid</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>it does no good to practice the wrong thing. To excel you must get a coach or advisor that will watch very move you are making and then give advice on the right direction to take, because running in the wrong direction enthusiastically is just plain stupid. Please note that this coach or advisor must have succeeded in his own endeavor. In other words, been there done that.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If you want to do better, you must get better:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>people do not do better because <em>they want to do better</em>; they do better because they <em>get better</em>. You cannot achieve a new outcome without learning something new and practicing what you learned (probably outside your comfort zone). A commitment to mastery (improving) is essential for excellence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>the people with the best life have the best choices</strong> people with a lousy life have lousy choices. If I want to improve my life, I need to create better choices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you will pay dumb tax if you ignore these principles or you will pay to fix the problem. Either way, you are writing a check.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>the road less stupid</em> is designed to accomplish 2 primary objectives</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide a structure/process/skill set to enable you to create successful Thinking Time ritual that, if applied, will result in a significantly reduced dumb tax.</li>\n<li>suggest a series of possible Thinking Time topics and questions you can use to spark your thinking, grow your business, make more money and ultimately avoid doing something stupid.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-5-core-disciplines-of-thinking\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-5-core-disciplines-of-thinking\" aria-label=\"the 5 core disciplines of thinking permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE 5 CORE DISCIPLINES OF THINKING</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Find the Unasked Question</strong>-Create a question that will result in clarity and generate better choices.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Another thing to note in the way the question is framed. It must be framed in such a way that engenders possible solutions or available improvements to the solution. Otherwise it’s a mere predicament or a statement. So if you must craft a problem, use this “How might I…so that I can…? This rule or guide line provides insight on how to remedy the situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you think of what needs to be broken versus what needs to be fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three characteristics that a carefully crafted question does are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides insight on what the actual problem is</li>\n<li>Simplify the problem and make it solvable</li>\n<li>Expand the number of possibilities available to solve the problem at hand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having the right answer is smart. Having the right question is genius. Or, as Peter Drucker said, “Most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The truly  dangerous thing is asking the wrong question.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>all problems are solvable (or at a minimum can be addressed so that we improve our situation). Our job as business owners and leadership teams is to get clarity on the right question to ask before we pull the trigger. We would all have better answers and more choices if we invested the time to design better questions and then actually allocated some Thinking Time to consider them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separate the Problem from the Symptom</strong> — Identify the real obstacle that is blocking my progress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The key to defining the root problem is discovering the obstacle (it resides in the gap) that is impeding your progress from here to there. It is the obstacle that is the problem, not the dissatisfaction with your current circumstances!</strong></li>\n<li>Most times when I look back at some of the mistakes we made as a company I realized that the problem wasn’t clearly articulated or it was a wrong statement of problem. I would usually wonder why we don’t have enough sales, why we don’t have enough customers, low profits, difficulty in finding quality staff, keeping quality staff etc. These are questions that are always on our mind as business owners.</li>\n<li>These questions are very valid but ultimately these questions are not the problems that exists but are rather the symptoms of a problem. We realized that we pointed out our biggest problems as the gaps between where we were and where we would like to be.</li>\n<li>The symptom is the gap while the problem is the obstacle.</li>\n<li>there are 2 fundamental difficulties with a misdiagnosis of root problem (or mislabeling the symptom as the obstacle)\n<ul>\n<li>the questions you ask and the solutions you find are usually tactical</li>\n<li>when the machines are constructed and deployed to address the symptom (but not the root problem, obstacle), resources are wasted and there is zero sustainable forward progress toward the desired outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the 3 most fundamental questions to ask to help get clarity about the root problem/obstacle are:\n<ul>\n<li>what are the possible reasons I’m noticing this symptom?</li>\n<li>what isn’t happening that, if it did happen, would cause the perceived gap (symptoms) to either narrow or disappear?</li>\n<li>what’s happening that, if it stopped happening, would cause the perceived gap (symptoms) to narrow or disappear.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Building a machine for the problem that isn’t and expecting forward progress is delusional.</li>\n<li>If we misdiagnose or mislabel the problem, we will gravitate toward designing solutions and building machines for the symptoms (aka “the problem that isn’t”) and this is a prescription for frustration and failure.</li>\n<li>Few things are worse than running the wrong direction enthusiastically. Misdiagnosing the problem or working on the wrong priorities results in a dumb tax!</li>\n<li>sustainable forward progress (aka “Kicking the Can”) is only possible by identifying\n<ul>\n<li>exactly where I am (Point A)</li>\n<li>exactly where the can is</li>\n<li>exactly where the goal line is in relation to me and the can (Point B) and</li>\n<li>then overcoming the specific obstacle preventing the can from crossing the goal line.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Check Assumptions</strong> - Differentiate the facts from the story I am spinning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What none of us see are the assumptions we make about the problem we have, the solution we create, or the opportunity in front of us. The reality is that virtually all my dumb tax could have been avoided if I had just questioned a couple of obvious assumptions prior to pulling the trigger.</li>\n<li><strong>what don’t I see</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>what I don’t see is what costs me money</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Buffet’s respond to $20 dollar bet:\n<ul>\n<li>“If I stood here and hit a thousand golf balls, the likelihood that any of them would go in the hole is very remote. Maybe if I hit 10K golf balls I might get lucky and one would go in; but, you’re not offering 10K - 1 odds. I know it’s a small amount of money and that I could easily affort it, but it’s bad odds. <strong>Stupid in small things, stupid in big things</strong>”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We would be better off if we spent some quality Thinking Time differentiating the facts from our emotions and fantasies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consider 2nd-Order Consequences</strong> - Clarify the risks and the possibility/cost of being wrong.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>We only have a choice about the decision we are about to make, not the consequences. An important decision that does not identify the possible risks as well as the probability and costs of failure is a decision with a high likelihood of creating drama. The problem with drama is that it always costs money.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I use the following 3 questions as one of my litmus tests to help me think before I act:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>what’s the upside</strong>?</li>\n<li><strong>what is the downside</strong>? what could go wrong? we rarely an do this one by ourselves because we’re irrationally emotional and optimistic about the thing we are deciding about.</li>\n<li><strong>can I live with the downside</strong>?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Risks don’t cease to exist just because you ignore them, and neither do facts. An honest assessment of what could go wrong, the probability of it going off the rails, and the cost in the event of failure are fundamental to minimizing your dumb tax.</li>\n<li>Thinking about 2nd-order consequences minimizes the probability of a double bogey. Mistakes are inevitable, but double bogeys are usually avoidable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create the Machine</strong> - Create the executable plan and identify the resources (people and money) required to solve the real (core) problem and make forward progress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shoes that don’t fit are not a bargain at any price. A good idea that can’t be executed is a bad idea.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>. Ultimately, the problem gets addressed or solved as a result of a machine that will move me from Point A (where I am) to Point B (where I want to go). The expectation is that the new machine will produce an output that improves my situation, closes the gap, and moves me closer to the desired outcome.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regardless of the change, management must shift priorities if the new solution has a shot at being effective. Changes in priorities are always accompanied by changes in the allocation of resources. The vast majority of solutions (machines) fail to produce the anticipated outcomes because management is unclear about the required shifts in focus, human capital, and money.</li>\n<li>Measurement is THE key to sustainability and a culture of accountability.</li>\n<li>finding the dash of paprika (tiny mistake) that is ruining your pie requires careful thinking and close observation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"thinking-time-the-process\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#thinking-time-the-process\" aria-label=\"thinking time the process permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THINKING TIME: THE PROCESS</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Designing a Thinking Time process that works for you will be no different than figuring out any other ritual you want to create. The time of day, the best location, and the optimum duration are all discovered through practice and experimentation until you have created a Thinking Time process that best supports your outcomes. The key here is to obsess about obtaining the outcomes and not about finding the perfect process!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>step by step process/structure for each Thinking Time sessions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>great thinking time session requires a great question as the launching pad. Prior to my thinking time session, I will create and write down a question(s) I want to think about.\n<ul>\n<li>create 3 to 5 questions that focus on a common thread or concern.</li>\n<li>sometimes, during actual thinking time session, change only 1 or 2 words in a querstion to see if I can get a different insight into the issue I’m thinking about.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, the original question might be: “Who is my target market?”, might change this to “Who as my target market”, I could tweak this question to: “Who is my competition’s target market” that question could easily change to: “If I was starting again today, what market would I target?” I could add this question: “If I wanted to double my sales, what market would I target” This might morph into: “Why aren’t my sales double what they are right now in the market I am currently targeting?”</li>\n<li>optimizing for possibilities (more questions, more possibilities) not completion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>clear calendar for 60 minutes, which will enable me to think for about three-quarters of an hour and then evaluate/sort the solutions and ideas I identified in the last 15 minutes or so</li>\n<li>3 possible scenarios for Thinking Time questions\n<ul>\n<li>create new question</li>\n<li>revisit a prior question that could use additional thought.</li>\n<li>use an answer from prior Thinking Time session as the basis for refining/fleshing out/changing the original question and searching for additional possible choices or variations on the theme.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>for most of the questions, one Thinking Time session is insufficient,\n<ul>\n<li>it’s hard to focus more than about 40 minutes</li>\n<li>usually think about same question in multiple Thinking Time sessions (2-3 is not uncommon) before finding out elegant answer that is worthy of execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>close the door, turn off the phones, and eliminate all noise and visual distractions. I sit in my chair (which does not face my computer or a window, where too many distractions and temptations pop up), question, pen, and big chief tablet in hand</li>\n<li>set a timer on my computer alerts me when my Thinking Time has expired and keeps me from fidgeting and looking at my watch.</li>\n<li>right before I start, I sip my water, scratch what itches, go to the bathroom, clear my throat, and then sit perfectly still. I have found over the years that my body has the power to derail my thinking and break my concentration. To optimize the thinking process, I must lose touch with my body so that my train of concentration is totally uninterrupted. During my Thinking Time, I’m totally motionless except for my right hand, which is recording my thoughts.</li>\n<li>this is a creative process and not intended to be filtered or judged. If I hit a blank or gap in which nothing is flowing (or my mind starts wandering), I will silently re-ask myself the question I’m working on during the particular session. I might also silently ask myself,\n<ul>\n<li>what else could it be?</li>\n<li>what could I do that would make this problem worse?</li>\n<li>how would my competition solve this problem?</li>\n<li>if I got fired and a new CEO took over, what decision would she make?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I remind myself that I’m looking for ideas and possibilities, not perfection and absolutes. I attempt to avoid judging my ideas. The more judgment I have about an idea during the actual Thinking Time process, the less creative and more prejudiced I tend to be.</li>\n<li>remarkably, I have found my better ideas tend to emerge during a pattern known as the “third third” The first third of my ideas on any given day are typically the obvious ones. The second third are variations on the first third. But the last third tends to be the most robust and frequently are where the juice is found.</li>\n<li>At the conclusions of 40-45 minutes of Thinking Time. I will always take at least 15-20 mins to read what I have written and capture the best ideas I have uncovered (usually no more than 3)</li>\n<li>the key is to connect the dots, not just collect more dots. I have a separate file in which I keep my best ideas, insights, and distinctions. These ideas can become the basis for a future Thinking Time session or might need to marinate for a few days.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fundamentally, Thinking Time is a structured process that enables me to minimize the risks, identify the opportunities, and maximize the results. That is a pretty high return for a very low-cost investment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"mmm-kool-aid\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#mmm-kool-aid\" aria-label=\"mmm kool aid permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>MMM… KOOL-AID</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning doesn’t happen until something changes.</li>\n<li>Business is complex and the future is unknown.

There</li>\n</ul>\n<p>is no such thing as a rich victim.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For the success of every business there are 4 different roles that must be played or present: Artist (Creator), Operator (Technician), Owner (Business), and Board (Investor)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Every new business always starts with the artist/creator hat or the operator/technician hat. For the former you are usually passionate about a new idea and you feel very pumped to take it to the world, while the latter usually has a skill and wants to showcase it to the world.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the primary crisis of most start-ups and small businesses is usually cash, traction, or operational structure, any one of which causes the Owner (Business) and Board (investor) roles to be ignored.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The honest truth is that as the business grows the required skills to hone are the skills to run a business which include; talent management, reading financial statements, creating dashboards, allocating resources, measuring outcomes, leveraging, delegating duties etc. These skills and many more are the skills needed to take the business from the artistic and operator mindset to the mindset of a business owner, where the business really grows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Note that these four hats are always needed at different times throughout the life cycle of any business. You use/wear them as the need arises in your business and it allows you see he business from different angles/sides and make better informed business decisions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having a hat for each role equips you to think about your business as a whole rather than just a set of discrete activities that must be performed –Keith Cunningham</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Never allow these Hats (Artist, Operator, Business Owner, Investor) to define who you are or your ability. Its just a way of thinking that you switch to when needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These hats are interchangeable at will but require different mindsets and skills that must be brought to bear in running your business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"./4-hats-business.png\">4 hats of business</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Artistic Hat:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>He has a creative mindset and would always want to make changes to the product or service.</li>\n<li>They fall into the trap that the better they get at their craft, the better they are accepted in the market place and therefore more money.</li>\n<li>Companies like Mcdonalds have long left the artistic hat, in other words the taste of the burger has remained the same but the system of producing the burger has constant improvement among other things.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, growth and control work inversely. The more growth you desire, the less control you can have (and vice versa).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operator Hat</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>These people are enormous hard workers and they believe in adding value through time and  effort.</li>\n<li>They believe that the harder you work, the more money they make, which isn’t totally true.</li>\n<li>They are crisis leaders who apply tactics rather than strategy.</li>\n<li>Fire fighters instead of fire preventers</li>\n<li>They don’t run the business; rather the business runs them,</li>\n<li>more often than not, when operator-drive business fail, it is because the operator has died of exhaustion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Business Owner Hat</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They are usually engaged and involved in the planning, execution, measurement, and  corrections necessary to proactively lead and manage the business and employees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An owner puts systems and structures in place to keep the company afloat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They focus on leverage to grow the business and are brutal about dashboards because it helps with measurements, accountability, meeting deadlines and delivering results. They use the above to run the business end of the business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They also use the power of delegation to allocate resources where needed to grow the business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usually the CEO that takes this role</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Board (Investor) Hat</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is similar to the Business owners mind set and focuses more on strategy and growth.</li>\n<li>the key attributes are the abilities to question, probe, think sequentially, substitute rational thought for emotion, anticipate crisis, predict 2nd-order consequences, and identify risks.</li>\n<li>The majority of dumb taxes incurred are a direct result of having only one voice in the conversation when the original decision was made. Adding experienced, wise, thoughtful, trustworthy voices to the conversation exposes risks, curtails faulty assumptions, and minimizes stupid.</li>\n<li>a board of directors serves as a coach/trusted advisor to the CEO. How members of the board think and what they think about is something every CEO/Owner should emulate, whether or not they have a formal Board. The vast majority of large, successful companies added a board of directors early in their trajectory. Filling this vital role is an integral part of the journey that must be traveled to avoid misguided, overly enthusiastic, irrational lurches that create dub tax and slow value creation and growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-Its usually filled by a group of people that are not involved in the day to day activities of the business but rather have an outside-in look into the business.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Their purpose is to expose pit falls and curtail faulty assumptions and steer the company away from making costly mistakes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>According to Keith Cunningham, The single best business decision you will ever make is to intentionally work with a peer group on a regular basis to question assumptions, ask hard questions (the kind you hope nobody will ask), alert you to icebergs, raise the bar, and push and hold you accountable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In summary. The Artist creates it, the Operator does it, the Business owner leads the team and the investor protects the business and keeps it alive,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>if my business could talk, what would it say?</li>\n<li>which hat has been my comfort zone and which hats are not getting worn often enough?

Culture, not a value statement, is the key to high performance and becoming the employer of choice. (Enron’s Value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Statement was Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence. A plaque on the wall is not a substitute for culture, and neither are nap rooms.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Anyone who says customers are #1 has lost their mind! Employees are #1. Employees are the source of all value creation. Culture (not jelly beans in the kitchen) is the source for engaged, turned-on employees. Show me a disinterested employee and I’ll show you a lousy culture, a weak leader, and a poor customer experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you’re about to initiate a cultural shift, be aware of these three common culture saboteurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iceberg #1: Deciding to change the culture within your business is not an initiative for the weak of heart or uncommitted. Creating and sustaining a world-class culture is an ongoing but immensely rewarding initiative. It lowe4rs turnover, improves efficiency, and makes the business a good place to work.</li>\n<li>Iceberg #2: There is always at least one person on a team who thinks he is immune to the culture transformation conversation.</li>\n<li>Iceberg #3: An unenforced rule is not a rule; it’s a suggestion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The reason we hesitate to have the hard conversations is because we don’t care enough. If you truly cared enough, you would say what needs to be said. After all, how else are they going to improve and maximize their potential? Let me remind you that nothing can change until the unsaid is spoken.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In order to understand what culture is, let’s begin with what it’s not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s not a mission, value, or vision statement plaques we hang up on our company wall.</li>\n<li>The coddling of employees; e.g nap rooms, concierge to pick up the dry cleaned clothes of the employees, stocking the kitchen with red bull, spa coupons for employees,</li>\n<li>Sad to say that the above DOES NOT drive culture, it rather drives an entitlement mentality in your employees.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Culture is result-oriented…getting stuff done is at the core of any organization’s culture. It’s the guard rails or guiding principles by which everyone must live by. It is ingrained in the heart and soul of the business (employees and employers). It is woven into the very fabric of the organization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Keith’s words “Culture is how we treat each other, how we talk to each other, whether or not we trust each other, and how we handle conflict. Culture is about accountability, measuring, a bias for urgency, a focus on solutions, calling it tight—saying what needs to be said—being kind and generous, acknowledging one another, and expressing appreciation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Craig’s list ads</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If you can commit and live with the following principles, then you are the type of person who will be successful and help our company thrive.

Pros never need motivating.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Show me a lousy culture and I will show you a lousy CEO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The key is the clarity on the obstacle and consistency of disciplined execution on the critical drivers. Consistency requires measurement. Discipline requires standards. Execution requires resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are 7 yardsticks that a CEO must be judged by to consistently produce quality results:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clearly define Point A and Point B</strong>: Most CEOs or leaders are every good in articulating where they are going to (Point B) or what you might call the vision. Its funny how most CEOs give a stunning presentation of the future they don’t have 100% control of but find it hard to determine where they are now (Part A); their present state. I honestly think that its only natural to know where we are going to after you know where you are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>“Determine the obstacle”</strong> This is only gotten when there is a clear definition of point A and point B. This obstacle is also known as the gap. This is the reason why you haven’t attained or achieve point B. At this stage you must separate the problem from the symptom and focus on the real problems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Design the plan/machine:</strong> After you have clearly defined point A and B, the obstacle or gap, then the next thing is to build a machine that will address the problems above. At this stage , the CEO can delegate at this stage or get his team members to be part of this so that they can also own it and run with it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Allocate resources:</strong> Once you determine the solution/machine to be used, the next thing is to allocate the adequate resources to make the machine work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just like Keith Cunningham said “A shift in priorities without a simultaneous shift in resource allocation is delusional. Anytime we announce new initiatives or change priorities, it requires a change in how we are allocating our resources (team, time, and money) must be allocated in such a way that permits the business to stay afloat while trying to birth and execute this new initiative or idea with this new machine. It also requires that we do less of one thing to allow us to do more of something else. None of us has the ability to keep adding without curtailing or stopping something else.”</li>\n<li>Keith Cunningham says it perfectly “In other words, the CEO must plan tomorrow’s breakfast while continuing to cook tonight’s dinner.” This is very tricky and requires a good amount of skill to adequately execute this; you must know the effect of the reduction of resources in order to increase it for another task.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Team players:</strong> This is so crucial to the workings of the machine. Machines don’t operate themselves, they need people to run it. The quality of the output of the machine is directly proportional to the quality of the team players. So it’s very important that everyone on your team brings their A-game to bear on the task at hand. Mediocrity should never have a place in your team. The watchword here is “ Mastery”. Just like Keith Cunningham said “Said another way, business success is highly dependent on whom you hire and whom you don’t fire.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here are some tips to distinguish A players include:\n<ul>\n<li>They have a scoreboard that helps them with measurements. They will not play if they can’t see the scoreboard</li>\n<li>They love healthy competition.</li>\n<li>They love accountability.</li>\n<li>they have the technical chops to do the job. This is not their first rodeo. They have been there, done that, and they are technically very good at what they do.</li>\n<li>They are humble enough to ask for coaching. The 3 most important questions an employee can ask are\n<ul>\n<li>what else can I do</li>\n<li>where can I get better?</li>\n<li>what do I need to do or learn so that I continue to grow?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>They are good at what they do and always seek to get better.</li>\n<li>They see opportunities, while others see problems.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>rules for hiring and retaining A players are\n<ul>\n<li>interview rigorously</li>\n<li>compensate generously</li>\n<li>onboard effectively</li>\n<li>measure consistently</li>\n<li>coach continuously.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>build the organization chart/structure:</strong> This cannot be overemphasized. It’s one of the differences between good companies and great companies. People or personnel must operate within a structure also known as the organizational chart. A structure gives support and provides protection to your business. Most importantly, the structure must be outcomes/result oriented instead of roles, titles, or names. In other words, every role must have tasks, outcomes, and deliverables that are assigned to people, and excuses for non or underperformance are not allowed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create a culture:</strong> Culture is a way of life. As a CEO, whatever you put in place as a culture will run into the fabric of your business. You must show that you are accountable, you care, and have a deep desire for success. You cannot have a culture that is not practiced. A culture that is not upheld is a mere vision or mission plaque that you hang on the wall.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how people talk to each other and treat one another is the essence of culture.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thinking Time</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>in light of 7 fundamental jobs of a CEO, where have I dropped the ball and what do I need to do differently to cause us to get better</li>\n<li>as I’m thinking about the next 100 days and what I will do differently, what are the things, I must do less of to make room for the things I need to do more of?</li>\n<li>if my team represents my leverage, what do I need to do or say to ensure their success?</li>\n<li>starting and perfection are rarely simultaneous.

Facts do not cease to exist just because you ignore them. A good market tends to hide mistakes. Nothing takes the place of being actively engaged in the running of your business and being thoughtful (as well as skeptical) about the future.</li>\n<li>Last week’s marketing report has absolutely nothing to do with where the market is headed, what the economy is doing, or what the demand will be next year.</li>\n<li>How you run your business during the good times is the only true predictor of how well your business will cope with the bad times.</li>\n<li>You must keep a conservative strategy during the good times because you generally don’t know you’re in bad times until it’s too late.</li>\n<li>No team has ever won the game with an “offense only” strategy. Great teams, the ones who win championship rings, all have fantastic defenses. They think about prevention, protection, and risks.</li>\n<li>Not all progress is measured by ground gained; sometimes progress is measured by losses avoided.</li>\n<li>Speed kills. True wealth is built slowly. Speed and greed necessitate aggressive leverage and increase the odds of catastrophe. It is better to go slower and avoid the do-overs.</li>\n<li>Our desire for growth and size was based on ego and greed, not strategy and wealth.</li>\n<li>The successful people we admire are not the ones who made it. We admire the ones who kept it.</li>\n<li>Owners MUST be hands-on and involved in every aspect of the business.</li>\n<li>We acted like it was a sin to miss a revenue opportunity. That makes as much sense as needing to eat everything at a Sunday buffet.</li>\n<li>Do not be afraid to say “no.” Saying “yes” does not always equal more.</li>\n<li>It’s delusional to believe our ability, intellect, and work ethic can overcome a bad market.</li>\n<li>Litigation is expensive, time-consuming, and to be avoided.</li>\n<li>The best way to avoid losses and to stay financially healthy is to “sell too soon.” The old real estate maxim “In the history of the world, the seller is always wrong” is outrageously stupid when you run out of cash!</li>\n<li>Don’t fall into the trap of believing you can sell it for a higher price tomorrow. The future is unknown (and unknowable) and fraught with risk.</li>\n<li>In the future, I would rather miss an opportunity than lose capital. .Never buy something because you think you might need it someday. .Keep working all your alternatives until something closes. It hasn’t closed until the money is in the bank.</li>\n<li>Success does not make you invincible or bulletproof. What success does best is make you complacent and egotistical, which by themselves are sufficient to create disaster.</li>\n<li>The euphoria of a hot market usually results in ignoring marketplace fundamentals. Prudently gathering and evaluating market-based economic information is the only prescription for avoiding the mistake of smoking your own exhaust.</li>\n<li>Never delay taking corrective action once the problem has been recognized. Hoping for better conditions in the future so the problem will solve itself is a fool’s game. Procrastination magnifies problems. •Failure to recognize reality is delusional. You might be smarter and better than your competition, but when the market shifts, you’re still broke. Don’t confuse intellect with economic reality.</li>\n<li>Never rely on only your consultant’s recommendations. If you don’t understand it, don’t do it.</li>\n<li>We did not narrow our focus when we knew times were getting worse. This was due to two things: (1) The distraction of our prior track record, and (2) An unwillingness to assess the risks of being wrong.</li>\n<li>A small percentage of a large number is a large number.</li>\n<li>Any fool can make money in the good times.</li>\n<li>The question should never be, “Should I pursue this opportunity?” The right questions are:</li>\n<li>If I pursue this opportunity, how much time, resources, effort, and investment are required?</li>\n<li>Is this in my wheelhouse (core competence)?</li>\n<li>What could go wrong?</li>\n<li>What are the returns if I am right and the costs if I am wrong? . Can I live with being wrong?</li>\n<li>The greater the past success, the greater the likelihood of the Superman fantasy. A lack of cash or cash flow is Kryptonite and it kills all superheroes. Always be skeptical and keep some powder dry.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Doing a deal to keep the staff busy is stupid. Do not do marginal deals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A bad economy doesn’t create financial problems; it just reveals them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Almost everything takes longer than you think it will and costs more than originally budgeted. Plan for delays and bumps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Just because prices have gone up the last several years doesn’t mean they can’t go down 30% next year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The easiest sale is to an employee or a consultant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When the market is bad, there are NO buyers… at any price.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delaying the decision to sell today because last year’s prices were higher or because the anticipated profits originally projected were greater is stupid. The market doesn’t care about either.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not follow the market down. Make deep cuts quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t let what your competition is doing influence your decisions. You can’t erect a fence to keep the competition out. Besides, they do stupid things sometimes too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Secondary locations always decline the fastest (and most) and take the longest to return.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New projects must be based on current demand and not future growth. •You do not have to swing at every pitch that is thrown. Do fewer, better deals. Not only will you optimize the results of the superior deals, you will also have far less overhead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Too many deals consume time and draw attention away from the really good ones.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-It takes three good deals to make up for one bad deal.\n-When a bad deal surfaces, 90% of management’s time is siphoned off from the rest of the business to deal with the problems it generates. The result: The bad one is still bad and the good ones are now mediocre or troubled as a result of a lack of attention. Ninety percent of management’s time should be spent on nurturing the good ones. Easy to say, hard to do.\n-Holding off on adjusting the price or overhead based on the belief the market will rebound quickly is irrational.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Financing</strong>\n-Debt gives the illusion of wealth. True wealth is assets, cash flow, and manageable (minimal) debt.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excessive debt and hope are the root of all financial crises. You can never ignore risks or suspend doubt.</li>\n<li>Doing a marginal deal just because the money is available is stupid. Bankers typically can’t assess the market risks either.</li>\n<li>Take your personal guarantee seriously. You only bring two things to the table: cash and your guarantee, neither of which has an unlimited supply.</li>\n<li>Don’t rely on future price increases to make a deal work. .Never finance long-term assets with short-term debt.</li>\n<li>We covered a lot of mistakes with access to an abundance of money and easy credit.</li>\n<li>Too much money makes you stupid. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.</li>\n<li>Stretching to do a deal by horsing the numbers in a spreadsheet is usually a sign of ego and rarely a good idea.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Personnel</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bench strength is critical. Find the best people and compensate them VERY well. It saves money in the long run.</li>\n<li>The tougher the times, the better the people you need. There is no way to survive a bad market with weak people.</li>\n<li>Adding/keeping mediocre people weakens the organization, which dilutes your results.</li>\n<li>Always be upgrading your talent and never be afraid to pay them what they need to make.</li>\n<li>Every hire we make should raise the average.</li>\n<li>One superstar 7-footer is far more valuable than ten 5-footers. Weak people beget weak results.</li>\n<li>Never wait to address personnel issues or substandard performance. Employees are either doing a great job or they aren’t. If they aren’t, take action. My job isn’t to babysit or beg people to do their jobs.</li>\n<li>The cost of tolerating an incapable or misplaced employee is far greater than the discomfort of having a tough conversation and speedy termination.</li>\n<li>A culture rooted in past successes, growth at all costs, and aggressive bonus structures will produce employees who don’t think, who aren’t skeptical, and who ignore risks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Overhead</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stay lean even if you can afford to get fat. Keep overhead low! •Watch your cash VERY closely. Ask yourself, “Do I really need this? Will this help me make more money?” Once the money is spent, it’s gone forever.</li>\n<li>Get really sober (medieval) on what needs to happen to your cost structure to produce the profits you want vs. the revenue you hope to get.</li>\n<li>Each line item of your financials should be scrutinized on a continuous basis to make sure the money is being spent in a productive and prudent way.</li>\n<li>Conserve cash, especially during the good times. Spending money to look like a big deal is not the same as being a big deal.</li>\n<li>When you’re out of cash, you’re out of business. Cash is truly KING.</li>\n<li>When the market shifts, you can’t cut overhead fast enough.</li>\n<li>it is easy to overpay or beef up when the world is viewed from only an upside perspective.</li>\n<li>Cut overhead early and hard. Pride and hubris kept us from cutting our overhead in a timely manner.</li>\n<li>Fancy offices, hot cars, lots of staff, and high overhead are signs of significance, not success.</li>\n<li>Knowing your numbers-what it costs to run each aspect of your business and having timely information are critical to success.</li>\n<li>Focus on the costs of doing business and not just the revenue potential.</li>\n<li>Paying for overhead we don’t need to support revenue we don’t have is stupid.</li>\n<li>Contract out as much of the work as possible.

Start with what customers want. Start with their needs, desires, and pain. Start with the gap between the solutions being offered by the competition and where they (the customers) are frustrated.</p>\n<p>In this chapter, Keith describes a story where he interrogates his wife on how he can be of better husband to her. Most importantly, what she wants/desires in a relationship. He starts with what she wanted in a relationship and she replies “I want to be Loved and Adored”. This was her goal. Then he went on to ask her “Now, tell me everything that needs to happen and exactly what it would look like for you to feel loved and adored.” For almost an hour and a half he kept on writing the answers to that question. He wondered why she wanted all this but iis what she wanted. Period. Even though he didn’t have the passion for it, he was ready to do everything he could make it happen. He even asked what happens if he forgets, she smiled and said I will remind you.</p>\n<p>Let’s pause here and think for a moment and analyze the story.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">He asked her for her goal, and she verbalized it.  </code></pre></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He then asked her what success means to her by asking “Now, tell me everything that needs to happen and exactly what it would look like for you to feel loved and adored.” Here he wanted her to verbalize what she actually wanted in plain language.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He was also committed to make it happen even though he didn’t have the passion for it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As a business owner, you must always find out what the customer wants. You are in business because of the customer. The mistake most people make is to create the product and then look for the customer. Here you find out what their pain points, needs and most importantly what success means to them?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once you have gotten their needs and pain points, the next thing is to find a solution that meets their need and their success proposition</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, your service/product delivery must be out of this world and exceptional. If this is not done well, you will jeopardize all the hard work you have put in the creation of the product. You are likely not to come back to a restaurant that had crappy service no matter how good the food tastes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To conclude, I would like to borrow these words from Peter Drucker that says when the marketing is done right, selling becomes unnecessary.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"help-me-understand\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#help-me-understand\" aria-label=\"help me understand permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>HELP ME UNDERSTAND</h1>\n<p>. When my effort to help you get better exceeds your effort to get better, this stops working for both of us.</p>\n<p>“Fix the problem and not the blame” is a statement that stands out for me and is also synonymous to treating the symptoms instead of treating the problem. Most times as business owners we tend to fall into the trap of managing instead of coaching. Leaders coach while managing usually takes the form of a sheriff.</p>\n<p>A coach sets the rules/guard rails and then guides you to your success while a sheriff sets the same rules and reprimands/punishes you for unmet expectations.</p>\n<p>Leaders usually have employees that have ownership of the jobs and understand that doing the work means keeping the job, while employees of a manager usually operate from fear of being punished.</p>\n<p>Leaders always make sure that there is communication such that the employees have a clear understanding of their job specification, understand their different tasks and if there is a grey area, they immediately call for help to get it solved.</p>\n<p>Employees under a leader will comply as a result of ownership, communication and accountability while the employees under a manager are compliant as a result of fear</p>\n<p>Leaders reprimand when needed while it is the first line of action for managers.</p>\n<p>Leaders have high performance teams because there is accountability, measurement and ownership, while managers have high maintenance teams that are working out of fear of being reprimanded/punished if they make mistakes.</p>\n<p>Finally, in the words of Keith Cunningham, “the two most important phrases used by leaders are: Help me understand and What do you recommend?</p>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>Operators react and sweat.

So I do more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most people in business. I do it because I like this kind of life.” —Warren Buffett</p>\n<p>The key to defining the root problem is discovering the obstacle (it resides in the gap) that is impeding your progress from here to there.

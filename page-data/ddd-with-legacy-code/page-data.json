This ACL activity is asynchronous with any action in either context, with a service level agreement (SLA) regarding the freshness of the translated data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Then it must be mapped into the bubble context, increasing the dependency between the two systems. Clearly, this is not the strategy to introduce crucial new information.</li>\n<li>Development in the autonomous bubble is not so tightly bound to the older contexts. Therefore, the model in this context can be more innovative and trow more freely, and a fresh new product can be created.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strategy 3: exposing legacy assets as services</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>one of the main challenges of SOA is the lack of attention to bounded contexts.</li>\n<li>Integrating with the legacy system, every new development effort gets dragged back into the old concepts and potentially tangled into the old implementation.</li>\n<li>Legacy assets were developed with a particular feature set in mind and are highly coupled to those features. This makes it hard to access what you want directly without going through layers designed for a very different purpose.</li>\n<li>open host service over anticorruption layer</li>\n<li>Commons Context, the most basic and widely used information, can be interchanged throughout the organization via one standard interchange model, the “Tragedy of the Commons.” But, unfortunately, the commons are prone to dumping.</li>\n<li>FIX has a way of describing an enormous range of financial trades and transactions and is used to interchange data between all sorts of organizations.</li>\n<li>a focused language, crafted for a modest suite of related services, usually gives the most satisfying balance between the fragmentation of the one-off service model and the total unification of the commons and the industry-standard</li>\n<li>we should get over the attitude that the ultimate goal is to eventually replace these older systems. That is a futile treadmill. Creating a bubble can allow you to selectively move responsibilities for the core domain, where you want to innovate, out into a new context.</li>\n<li>Open host services over an ACL can give convenient, decoupled access to functionality and data assets embedded in the older systems. Once the legacy system is stable, not responsible for the core domain, and provides access to assets, why not let it be? You have better things to do right now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>strategy 4: expanding a bubble</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>one challenge that is particularly acute in a bubble is how critical it is to coordinate the incremental development of the new business functionality and the anticorruption layer in parallel. This affects the design and the planning of the sequence in which the features are written.</li>\n<li>design freedom is the point of a bubble, the bubble context with an umbilical ACL gives a little freedom, while the autonomous bubble can give a lot if properly managed.</li>\n<li>things to think about for ACL\n<ul>\n<li>does the new feature draw on information that is already being brought in by the existing anti-corruption layer</li>\n<li>will it require new mapping of legacy information? what is the scope of that work?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>if multiple features were chosen for the iteration call for new mapping, are they drawing on the same information, or does each call for different information?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>to make development manageable, the priority of business features must be balanced with the need to group work on features that use similar legacy data sets, with parallel planning of the necessary enhancements to the anticorruption layer.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if not careful, the bulk of the project’s effort will go into implementing a big translator interface, each element of which is only sparsely used. This gives a low ROI for the context boundary, and eventually an unsustainable maintenance burden. Or developers would take shortcuts by making sloppy mappings or simply bypassing the ACL, pull the data they need directly from the legacy system, and the context boundary will erode and collapse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the developers working on various features all drawing that same data can collaborate to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>model the new information by adding concepts to the bubble context</li>\n<li>extend the ACL to bring in the new information. (This should be an explicit development task, not just part of a ‘user story’)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Trying to reuse the fields/data from legacy without a mapping is a mistake. The concept represented by those fields was never mapped to a concept in the downstream context. We have no idea what they mean in the downstream context or how they relate to other concepts in the downstream model. It creates bigger objects with more dependencies and that is poorly defined.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when you must make choice, try to make the bubble’s model capable of expressing the essential meaning of the new information in terms consistent with the other concepts of that model. It is inadvisable to load objects down with information that does not directly pertain to their jobs, so it is best to do a bit more modelling work to find good homes for the new information.</li>\n<li>bypass the context altogether, give the client access to the context where the information originated or pass it some other way (particularly when the new data is for display only) Sometimes this is a good time to expose a legacy asset with a service as in Strategy 3.</li>\n<li>pass the information unchanged through new context. (Not recommended) since you have bored a tunnel through your anticorruption layer and compromised your ability to evolve your new model independently of the legacy system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>adding data is a modelling job</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is a way of referring to some aspect of some business situation, and the goal when translating this new element into your bubble context is to enrich the ubiquitous language to be able to express these concerns.</li>\n<li>explore new scenarios in the DDD modelling whirlpool</li>\n<li>in order to pull in more data to use in logic or key definitions in your context, you should follow the whirlpool steps\n<ul>\n<li>hammer out a reference scenario that illustrates why you need a new information</li>\n<li>brainstorm model changes that incorporate that information organically</li>\n<li>context boundary leakage gets out of hand quickly and suddenly you may wake up to realize that your new software is conforming to the legacy model and does not give the desired fresh start for the business.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>domain driven design refactoring</h1>\n<h2>examples from jimmy bogard</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jbogard/presentations/tree/master/DomainDrivenRefactoring\">https://github.com/jbogard/presentations/tree/master/DomainDrivenRefactoring</a>\n<a href=\"https://jimmybogard.com/domain-driven-refactoring-extracting-domain-services/\">https://jimmybogard.com/domain-driven-refactoring-extracting-domain-services/</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dQRAsVhCqA&#x26;list=PL41_dKwKrOq_TEVkFLeFChhUhqNDmQXF8&#x26;index=3&#x26;ab_channel=NDCConferences\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dQRAsVhCqA&#x26;list=PL41_dKwKrOq_TEVkFLeFChhUhqNDmQXF8&#x26;index=3&#x26;ab_channel=NDCConferences</a></p>\n<h1>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“Sub-domain is a problem space concept, Bounded context is a solution space concept.”</p>\n<p>“As software developers, we fail in two ways: We build the thing wrong, or we build the wrong thing.”</p>\n<p>“A project faces serious problems when its language is fractured.”</p>\n<p>“Integration is always expensive, and sometimes the benefit is small.”</p>\n<p>“Architectures can straitjacket a project with up-front design assumptions and take too much power away from the developers/designers of particular parts of the application.

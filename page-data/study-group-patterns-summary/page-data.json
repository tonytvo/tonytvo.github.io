If you had to explain the main idea of TDD to someone else, what would you say?</li>\n<li>write your explanation in a sentence or two on a post-it.</li>\n<li>put up a flipchart with the question “what is the main idea of TDD?” Ask people to stick their post-it notes on it.</li>\n<li>read some notes out to the group before you partway.</li>\n<li>hang the poster somewhere prominent afterwards, perhaps in the team area or coffee room.</li>\n<li>if working remotely, they can each write their sentence or two in a shared online document.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Continuous learning</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.industriallogic.com/img/blog/2005/09/ContinuousLearning.pdf\">industrial logic continous learning</a></li>\n<li>XP teams are very code-centric and focused on making functional software. When reflection and learning happen, it’s often in a watered down, haphazard way.</li>\n<li>someone has to decide to make learning not just an individual experience but a collective experience. When that happens, learning isn’t just something that occurs naturally, it is something that the company uses to drive the future of business.</li>\n<li>“what is the simplest, most cost-effective way to share learnings?”</li>\n<li>a group of people who functioned together in an extraordinary way, who trusted one another, who complemented each others’ strengths and compensated for each others’ limitations, who had common goals were larger than individual goals, and who produced extraordinary results.\n<ul>\n<li>the team that became great didn’t start off great - it <strong>learned</strong> how to produce extraordinary results.</li>\n<li><strong>a programmer’s study group will meet regularly in a comfortable place to delve into important technical topics. These topics can come from group’s learning repository, from books or articles, or even from a guest participant.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>a learning repository</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>a simple, security-free, browser-based learning repository, such as Ward Cunningham’s Wiki</li>\n<li>just install it and asking folks to use it isn’t enough. Teams need to establish usage convention\n<ul>\n<li>developers will quickly jot down learnings on index cards, as they work, and when they integrate their code, they can integrate significant learnings as well.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>atlassian confluence provides similar functionality but how can we organize and maintain the group knowledge effectively?</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>A pattern language for study groups</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.industriallogic.com/img/blog/2012/03/khdraft1.pdf\">a pattern language for study groups</a></li>\n<li>a study group can make a difficult book easier to understand, it can succeed where an unsatisfying class fails, and it can support you if your environment doesn’t support your ongoing learning and growth.</li>\n<li>once teams produce enough learning content they will need to reflect on and discuss it.</li>\n<li>there are 2 good places to do this: for technical matters, the best place is a programmer’s study group; and for team, people or process maters, the best place is in an iteration retrospective.</li>\n<li><strong>every programmer on the team needed to at least be aware of the system’s potent smells. This would enable them all to pay attention to these smells and consider how to refactor them out of existence</strong>.\n<ul>\n<li>look into process of documenting these potent smells (index cards, wiki, etc…). This would eventually led to direct action</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>recommend that groups meet for 2 hours if they want to delve deeply into a subject, though one-hour meetings are fine for covering topics quickly</li>\n<li>absolutely no one should play the role of lecturer or teacher in a study group.\n<ul>\n<li>the group meets to conduct group learning.</li>\n<li>if someone is expert in a certain technical area, that individual ought to help others learn, not show off or talk down to participants.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>continuously learning coach\n<ul>\n<li>the coach is the leader of the team. If the coach doesn’t value learning, the team won’t either.</li>\n<li>the coach must lead by example. This means that the coach will seek out and obtain coaching and mentoring from the best sources available.</li>\n<li>coaches must strive to learn about their customer’s needs, team or personality conflicts, new technologies, and the latest wisdom about XP and other lightweight methods.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>retrospectives</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>the continuous learning approach to retrospectives means they come not at the end of a project, but at the end of every iteration.\n<ul>\n<li>conducting iteration retrospectives will enable teams to quickly adjust and improve their performance, because they will be continuously revisiting these questions:\n<ul>\n<li>what worked well?</li>\n<li>what did we learn?</li>\n<li>what should we do differently next time?</li>\n<li>what still puzzles us?</li>\n<li>what happened?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>people have a fear of retrospectives, because they have a fear of being attacked, of being made to look foolish, of getting a poor performance review or of hurting someone’s feelings.</li>\n<li>it’s detrimental to retrospectives if people are afraid, or if there is an atmosphere of blame, criticism, sarcasm, or even humor at other people’s expense.</li>\n<li>“regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills, and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”</li>\n<li>it’s vital that the facilitator be an outsider and not a member of the team involved in the retrospective.</li>\n<li>participants take the lessons learned during the retrospective and turn them into concrete ideas for improving their development process.\n<ul>\n<li>the key to retrospective is to make sure you’re solving the correct problem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>knowledge hydrant</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>where can one obtain knowledge in its fullest unfiltered, unsimplified form.</li>\n<li>great literature tends to be hard to study and understand. Many people either aren’t prepared to do this hard work or simply don’t want to</li>\n<li>authors of great literature commonly reference, extend, or refute ideas communicated by their ancestors or peers. This can make it doubly hard to understand their writings, since one may need to understand referenced works in order to understand author’s own work.</li>\n<li>as great literature ages, people don’t believe it will contain the “modern” knowledge they need. So even if some great book written 30 years ago contains the exact knowledge they seek, people won’t find it, for they are unaware of the abundance of knowledge contained in older works of literature.</li>\n<li>the hard work put into the study of great literature is worthwhile because it ensures that people retain the knowledge they wish to obtain</li>\n<li>great literature is much easier to understand when it is studied in an intelligent sequence <a href=\"#sequential-study\">sequential study</a></li>\n<li>it is easier and more rewarding to study great literature with other people <a href=\"#pool-of-insight\">pool of insight</a></li>\n<li>discover the great literature in your profession or area of interest - the finest books, articles, and speeches ever written, and then begin an earnest study of these works.</li>\n<li>how do you find the great literature worthy of study? Ask people. Ask knowledgeable people which authors they like, what are their favorite books, what profoundly influenced them?</li>\n<li>after identifying the works, form or join a study group, <a href=\"#pool-of-insight\">pool of insight</a>, order the works to be studied <a href=\"#sequential-study\">sequential study</a> and compose an <a href=\"#agenda\">agenda</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>sequential study</h2>\n<h2>pool of insight</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>once you’ve discovered your <a href=\"#knowledge-hydrant\">knowledge hydrant</a>, it can be overshelming to drink from it. This pattern suggests how to make the study of great literature easier and more rewarding</li>\n<li>there’s nothing wrong with reading and studying literature on one’s own. But great literature is worth knowing well, and individual study pales in comparison with teh study of literature in a group dialogue.</li>\n<li>in communicating how they understand something, people may\n<ul>\n<li>clarify what confused others</li>\n<li>expose their own misunderstandings</li>\n<li>reveal new ideas</li>\n<li>articulate that which they didn’t know they knew</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>in a dialogue, nobody is trying to win. Everybody wins if anybody wins.\n<ul>\n<li>whenever any mistake is discovered on the part of anybody, everybody gains.</li>\n<li>there is a spirit present in dialogues that one doesn’t find in many other learning environments</li>\n<li>many groups sustain a group’s spirit by meeting weekly or biweekly</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>read and study literature on one’s own, but discuss it with others in a regular study group. Aim to ask questions about you don’t know and explain what you do know. Your exchanges with colleagues will enrich your understanding immensely.</li>\n<li>the best study groups are those in which individuals feel comfortable learning with others <a href=\"#safe-place\">safe place</a></li>\n<li>some environments promote dialogues, <a href=\"#common-ground\">common ground</a> and <a href=\"#public-living-room\">public living room</a></li>\n<li>the most enriching study happens when a group has a <a href=\"#motivated-moderator\">motivated moderator</a> and <a href=\"#prepared-participants\">prepared participants</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>agenda</h2>\n<h2>safe place</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>a good physical environment <a href=\"#common-ground\">common ground</a>, <a href=\"#public-living-room\">public living room</a> is vital for any study group.

But please know that it’s often the tiny details that thrill someone enough to make them tell all their friends about you.”</p>\n<p>“If you would not want to be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading or do things worth writing.” - Ben Franklin.</p>\n<p><strong>“What is the ultimate quantification of success? For me, it’s not how much time you spend doing what you love. It’s how little time you spend doing what you hate.”</strong></p>\n<p>“Once we get those muddy, maddening, confusing thoughts [nebulous worries, jitters, and preoccupations] on the page, we face our day with clearer eyes.”</p>\n<p><strong>“I have come to learn that part of the business strategy is to solve the simplest, easier, and most valuable problem.”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>“So if you’re planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10-year plan of how to get there, you should ask: Why can’t you do this in 6 months?”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There are no actual rules, so make rules that work for you.</strong></p>\n<p>“I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only have one skill.”</p>\n<p><strong>“At the end of the day, who cares? What’s the big deal? I’m here, I’m going to try my best, and I’m going to go home, and my family’s there. Even though my whole world’s wrapped up in this, who cares?”</strong></p>\n<p>“Greatness comes from humble beginnings. It comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room - until you change that with results. There is an old saying, “say little, do much.”</p>\n<p>“Truth is, young creative minds don’t need more ideas. Instead, they need to take more responsibility with the ideas they’ve already got.”</p>\n<p>“In reality, long-term travel has nothing to do with demographics - age, ideology, income - and everything to do with personal outlook. Long-term travel isn’t about being a college student - it’s about being a student of daily life. Long-term travel doesn’t require a massive “bundle of cash”; it requires only that we walk through the world more deliberately.”</p>\n<p>There is more freedom to be gained from practicing poverty than chasing wealth. Suffer a little regularly, and you often cease to suffer.</p>\n<p><strong>Life is not waiting for the storm to pass. Instead, it’s learning how to dance in the rain.</strong></p>\n<p>No, Accept reality, but focus on the solution. Take that issue, take that setback, take that problem, and turn it into something good. Go forward. If you’re part of a team, that attitude will spread throughout.</p>\n<p>“Ours is a culture where we wear the ability to get by on very little sleep as a kind of badge of honour that symbolizes work ethic, or toughness or some other virtue - but really, it’s a total profound failure of priorities and self-respect.”</p>\n<p>“Titans create their own rules, which allow them to transform their reality according to their will.”</p>\n<p><strong>“Everyone wants freedom, but few people have the discipline to reach it.”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>“overestimate what we can accomplish a day, underestimate what we can accomplish in a year.”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>“focus on small daily actions that compound over a long time.”</strong></p>\n<p>when in doubt, zoom out.</p>\n<p>“it’s scary to put yourself out there, to expose yourself, to become vulnerable, but it makes all the differences. Be a man, woman in the arena. When you let your mind wander in its truly natural state, good things happen.”</p>\n<p><strong>want to get unstuck, go for a walk, no phone, no music, no podcast, just you, your thought and the fresh air.</strong></p>\n<p>“be deliberate about what you spend your time on and who you spend it with.”</p>\n<p>“not matter how far you go, always remember, you didn’t make it on your own, pay it forward, be a mentor, be a champion for others, their growth should be your tremendous source of joy and pride.”</p>\n<p><strong>“The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion.”</strong></p>\n<p>“Productivity is for robots. What humans are going to be good at is asking questions, being creative, and experiencing.”</p>\n<p><strong>Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>judge a person by his/her questions rather than his/her answers.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>“my goal for each reader to like 50%, love 25%, and never forget 10%.”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>“Success, however you define it, is achievable if you collect the right field-tested beliefs and habits.”</strong></p>\n<p>“The superheroes you have in your mind (idols, icons, titans, billionaires, etc…) are nearly all walking flaws who’ve maximized 1 or 2 strengths…; you succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around them.”</p>\n<p>I’m not the strongest. I’m not the fastest. But I’m good at suffering.</p>\n<p>Everyone fighting a battle that you know nothing about</p>\n<p>“Routine, in an intelligent man, is a sign of ambition.”</p>\n<p>very often, “our” beliefs are not our own</p>\n<p><strong>“borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your bespoke blueprint.”</strong></p>\n<p>How do I become less competitive in order that I can become more successful?</p>\n<p>Tell me something that’s true that very few people agree with you on.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://fourminutebooks.com/tools-of-titans-summary/\">https://fourminutebooks.com/tools-of-titans-summary/</a>\n<a href=\"https://calvinrosser.com/notes/tools-of-titans-tim-ferriss/\">https://calvinrosser.com/notes/tools-of-titans-tim-ferriss/</a>\n<a href=\"https://blog.12min.com/tools-of-titans-summary/\">https://blog.12min.com/tools-of-titans-summary/</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.getstoryshots.com/books/tools-of-titans-summary/\">https://www.getstoryshots.com/books/tools-of-titans-summary/</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.grahammann.net/book-notes/tools-of-titans-tim-ferriss\">https://www.grahammann.net/book-notes/tools-of-titans-tim-ferriss</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.nateliason.com/notes/tools-titans-tim-ferriss\">https://www.nateliason.com/notes/tools-titans-tim-ferriss</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.hustleescape.com/book-summary-tools-of-titans-by-tim-ferriss/\">https://www.hustleescape.com/book-summary-tools-of-titans-by-tim-ferriss/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"tools of titans summary","date":"December 22, 2021","description":"tools of titans summary."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/domain-driven-design-summary/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"domain driven design by Eric Evans summary"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/4-hours-body/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"4 hours body summary"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6103d821-51e7-502c-8dfd-3c811a7d05c6","previousPostId":"a0bca0b6-039b-5959-9e9f-17dd6b442a37","nextPostId":"1d993fb3-2081-5322-a666-161229773f0c"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}

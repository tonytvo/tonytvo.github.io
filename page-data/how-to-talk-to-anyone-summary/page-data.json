Research indicates that “as many as 10,000 units of information flow per second” between individuals.</li>\n<li>Numerous proven techniques can increase your attractiveness and dynamism.</li>\n<li>People learn everything they need to know about you within the first few seconds of meeting you. Meanwhile, you are also forming powerful first impressions.</li>\n<li>You send clear signals about how you feel without saying a word.</li>\n<li>“Fine-tune your smile.”</li>\n<li>To make people feel great about you, focus your conversation on them.</li>\n<li>Many people are as frightened to make small talk as they appear on the stage.</li>\n<li>You will become a far more intelligent speaker if you simply find substitutes for a few “overworked words” such as “smart, nice, pretty or good.”</li>\n<li>we consistently overestimate our ability to judge strangers\n<ul>\n<li>with the smallest glimmer of information, we judge people we don’t know.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>we are incapable of spotting deception\n<ul>\n<li>we assume truthfulness until the evidence pointing toward deception is overwhelming.</li>\n<li>Generally, observers believe that most people are telling the truth. To tip from suspicion to disbelief, observers need an absolutely clear trigger. This could be clear agitation, total avoidance of eye contact or someone struggling to find words when directly accused of cheating. Without that trigger, our suspicions remain just that, and we assume truthfulness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Some people are better at spotting deception, but assuming the truth is important for society to function.\n<ul>\n<li>We can celebrate perceptive skepticism, but for most of us, it doesn’t matter that we can’t spot lies. Defaulting to truth makes sense, and Bernie Madoff and Ana Montes are outliers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Life isn’t like an episode of Friends – what you see on people’s faces doesn’t tell the whole story.\n<ul>\n<li>Transparency is the idea that someone’s demeanour reveals an authentic picture of their feelings. It’s one of the primary expectations we have when judging strangers. The problem is that transparency is often completely misleading.</li>\n<li>When strangers aren’t transparent, we easily and completely misjudge them.</li>\n<li>some people simply aren’t transparent. They’re mismatched, or their demeanour doesn’t reflect what they’re thinking.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alcohol can make interactions between strangers far worse, with terrible consequences\n<ul>\n<li>And a murky situation gets even murkier when alcohol is involved. The author believes that alcohol causes people to become myopic. Alcohol makes us disproportionately focus on short-term wants and forget about long-term consequences. Normally, we maintain a balance between the two.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are some ways we can get better, and the best way to start is to stop making assumptions</li>\n<li><strong>Humans are ill-equipped to understand strangers. We assume that people tell the truth, so we can’t detect lies. And we believe that we can judge strangers based on little, usually deceptive, information. The result of this misplaced confidence is that we don’t invest enough time and patience in truly listening to and understanding each other.</strong></li>\n<li>evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin believed that similar, easily interpreted expressions – of joy, sadness, fear, surprise, and the like – were consistent for all peoples and cultures. These things are not consistent at all, which explains why people can’t accurately gauge strangers’ emotions or intent across – or even within – cultures</li>\n<li><strong>Circumstances, Conditions and Context</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Gladwell affirms that you must face the additional problem of context beyond your inability to read strangers’ emotions and your powerful bias to believe what they tell you. Where and when you meet a stranger, he emphasizes, matters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"clever-hans-the-counting-horse\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#clever-hans-the-counting-horse\" aria-label=\"clever hans the counting horse permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“Clever Hans, the Counting Horse”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In Europe during the halcyon years before World War I, “Clever Hans, the counting horse,” was, without a doubt, the most talked-about sensation on the continent. A brilliant entertainer with a unique act, Hans could somehow supply accurate answers to math questions that audience members posed to him. He quickly tapped out the correct answers to any problem – addition, subtraction, multiplication and division – with a hoof. The horse’s owner, Herr von Osten, was always by his side while Hans performed these seemingly miraculous feats – but he never spoke to the horse or signalled him in any way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No one had ever seen such an amazing animal! Expanding beyond math, Hans “learned the alphabet.” By tapping his hoof several times for each letter, he would answer questions from audience members concerning the latest news or subjects such as geography and history. Hans always answered every question correctly. Eventually, scientists and other leaders organized a special commission to investigate the “human horse.” They asked von Osten to leave the hall for their test. Then, they had Hans perform his usual math and language wizardry in front of a crowd. But the horse still did not miss an answer, tapping out correct responses to numerous questions from the commission’s leader. No one could stump the brainy Hans.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The public insisted that investigators form another commission. Members organized a second test in which the questioner whispered questions in Hans’s ear so no one else could hear. This time, Hans could not answer even a single question correctly. Instead of being brilliant, the horse was revealed as a dummkopf! Can you guess how the commission’s members proved Hans was a fraud? Von Osten had taught the horse to read the audience members’ “body-language signals.” As Hans tapped his hoof, people in the audience would exhibit clear signs of tension – straining forward, holding their breath – until the horse reached the correct number. Then they would all relax, at which point von Osten had taught Hans to stop tapping immediately. Hans was “clever” – but not because he was a math genius or geography expert. He simply knew how to take cues for his actions from the subtle responses of the people around him. “Know your audience” is one of the primary rules of effective communications. Hans, the horse, was able to learn this important lesson.

To make sure people get an overwhelmingly positive impression when they first meet you, use the following tips:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Smile slowly</strong> – Don’t smile as soon as you meet someone. People will assume that you do this with everyone. Instead, wait a second or two, look long and deep at the person you are meeting, then smile big. This brief delay signals that you are not smiling because it is socially desirable, but because you see something special in this particular person that you really like.</li>\n<li><strong>“Sticky eyes”</strong> – Show people that you truly can’t take your eyes off of them. Maintain perfect eye contact while you speak with them.</li>\n<li><strong>“The big baby pivot”</strong> – When you meet someone, pivot directly toward him or her with a “total-body turn,” flash a genuine smile, and show the undivided and very special attention you would give to a young child who has just crawled up into your lap.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-know-what-to-say-after-you-say-hi\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-know-what-to-say-after-you-say-hi\" aria-label=\"how to know what to say after you say hi permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“How to Know What to Say After You Say, ‘Hi’”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Many people, including senior executives, motivational speakers and great performers, hate to make small talk. But it is an art that you can easily muster if you follow these tactics:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The “mood match”</strong> – Don’t speak with someone else until you first sample his or her mood. Once you have, ensure that your opening words “match that mood.” This is particularly important for salespeople.</li>\n<li><strong>“Wear a ‘whatzit’”</strong> – Starting a conversation with a stranger is not easy. One way to get the ball rolling is to wear something distinctive that he or she is sure to comment upon – a novel tie-tack, a piece of antique jewelry, or a special lapel pin or button.</li>\n<li><strong>The “swivelling spotlight”</strong> – People love to speak about themselves. Imagine a giant spotlight that rotates to light up your counterpart. Keep the spotlight – and focus – on that person and not yourself.

Let your shared interest come out gracefully during the conversation.</li>\n<li><strong>“Comm-YOU-nication”</strong> – Slip the word “you” into your discourse as often as possible. This focuses the content on the other person and gains his or her attention and approval.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid euphemisms</strong> – Always speak directly and to the point.

Pick up the lingo by listening to others to find out what their special words and phrases mean so you can use them appropriately.</li>\n<li><strong>Hit their “hot buttons”</strong> – Each professional group has provocative issues – for example, doctors get feisty about their relationships with hospitals. Find out these issues, then mention them to spice up your exchanges.</li>\n<li><strong>“Read their rags”</strong> – The best way to gain inside knowledge about a specific field is to read the trade journals that report on it.

often makes meetings frustrating is the fact that different people might think it’s a different kind of meeting</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>here are some tips to make meetings run more smoothly the 15-minute rule</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parkinson’s law states that work expands so as to fill the time available for it’s completion and not according to how complex it really is there for\n<ul>\n<li>it makes sense to

immediately</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the question rule there are three types of question that you can ask in a meeting</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>first comprehension questions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>second questions to support the process for example to make sure that everyone has really understood everything and is talking about the same thing and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>third questions that show how much you know in order to underscore your own position or challenge another person</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>all three types of question are

later the Roman Cicero and quintillion established a complex five-point plan for writing brilliant speeches which essentially boils down to this</p>\n<ul>\n<li>everything Aristotle considered rhetoric

presentations according to the social linguist William labov if we\nweave hard facts into narrative patterns associations with well-known fairy tales are evoked in our memories\nwhich remind us of the pleasure of listening to them with the consequence\nthat our attention span increases classic fairy tales follow a particular sequence\nabstract how does it begin Once Upon a Time orientation whose

story\na lecture should be structured along the same lines the idea is not new\nAristotle see theory of rhetoric was already aware of the importance of emotion and speech making\nand in 1984 the communication researcher Walter Fisher came up with a radical\nthesis people do not want logical arguments they want good stories\nour life is not an Excel spreadsheet it is a story with ups and downs\nFisher’s idea is summed up in his famous narrative Paradigm which represents a\nbreak with classical rhetoric we do not evaluate a story on the basis of arguments but on the basis of how much\nwe trust or believe in the story can I identify with the subject or the people and its coherence does the story\nmake sense Chris Anderson the inventor of Ted says something similar about the\nthree rules for a perfect Ted Talk one don’t talk about a concept eh deficiency\nor a product talk about an idea two focus on just one idea\nthree talk about the idea in such a way that people will want to tell others about\nit the next time you have to say something in front of other people start your\ntalk with this sentence let me tell you a short story or on the way\nhere something strange happened to me 7. principal negotiation\nhow to reach an agreement negotiation is the Fine Art of finding a solution to an apparently impossible\nsituation one of the best known negotiating methods principled negotiation is based on the book getting\nto yes by Roger Fisher and William L Yuri let’s break down this strategy and\napply it to real life think about a complex situation negotiating your\nsalary with your boss pocket money with your children a ransom demanded by\na blackmailer and try to apply the following principles to the situation\nthing not person do not be distracted by whether you like the other person or not\nsimilarities not differences don’t think I am in the weaker or stronger\nnegotiating position ask yourself what does the other person need from me do we have common interests\ngood enough not perfect you should not be aiming for the maximum possible\nbecause Perfection is like the Unicorn it’s rumored to exist but nobody has\never seen it so alongside your desired outcome to the negotiation have a plan be prepared\nbefore negotiations even start this is called the batna principle best\nalternative to a negotiated agreement it offers the best alternative when an\nagreement can’t be reached there are two schools of thought when it comes to negotiation the first\nbelieves that you have to negotiate hard and conquer the other side it’s not enough to win someone has to lose\nthe other recommends negotiating softly in order not to put a strain on the relationship\nprincipal negotiation falls into the second camp and recommends Cooperative negotiation negotiating\nproperly means that everyone gets more than they originally hoped for you must never try to make all the money\nthat’s in a deal let the other fellow make some money too because if\nyou have a reputation for always making all the money you won’t have many deals\nJ Paul Getty eight the feedback method how to criticize\nfeedback is one of the most sensitive processes in communication it is easy to hurt people with criticism\nbut false Compliments are also unhelpful harsh criticism damages our self-esteem\nand can lead us to make unwise choices but flowery compliments often\nmake us too complacent as for the person giving the feedback most people are prone to being\ncritical as it gives them a feeling of superiority they feel like they need to\nCrush bad or weird ideas feedback can be analyzed along two axes\nit can be negative or positive and constructive or destructive\nso this gives us four different types of feedback 1. no negative destructive feedback you\nare simply told the idea is bad without being given an explanation or offered an alternative\nwhile this can be at times an effective feedback that seldom changes the\nbehavior of the receiver two no because negative constructive\nfeedback you are told you are wrong and then you are presented with the correct answer\nthis is how Old School teaching works three yeah but positive destructive\nfeedback most managers have sooner or later heard about the importance of giving positive feedback\nso they start off by saying something positive about your idea just to deconstructed afterwards and offer a\ncontrary opinion the idea is good but for yes and the appreciative response\ntried to find the one thing in The Proposal that works and build on that\nthis goes back to appreciative inquiry a method attributed to an American David cooperider that\ninvolves concentrating on the strengths positive attributes and potential\nof a company or a person rather than weaknesses according to this\nTheory focusing too strongly on the flaws of an idea or project stifles the\nopen and positive approach that is essential for good working practices careful of course we sometimes have to\ndeliver crystal clear or even harsh feedback but the point is people learn better if\nthey are offered constructive feedback we know this from brainstorming sessions\nwhere the flow and fun increase the more positive The Exchange collaboration it\nseems dies when the response is negative and ideas are killed before they are\nexplored whenever you are about to give feedback ask yourself how can I make\nthis idea better rather than why is this idea bad nine groupthink what happens when\neveryone has the same opinion for a long time it was common knowledge that group decision making was\nbetter than individual decision making even today we often celebrate\ncollaborations consensual decisions and teamwork however as early as 1972 a Yale\npsychologist Irving Janus pointed out in a spectacular radical paper that\nsometimes also groups make very bad decisions Janus had studied such debacles as Pearl\nHarbor or the Vietnam War and what he found was that these groups had rejected critical opinions\nand outside information in the warmth of a like-minded group people reassure themselves that they are right that\ntheir analysis is superior to that of Outsiders that there consensus is a sign of the strength of\nthe group when in fact they have been looking only for evidence that confirmed their objectives\nand any doubts in the room where silence because if everyone seems enthusiastic and\nagrees with the plan we will feel reluctant to speak up even if we have\nserious doubts this by the way seems to be one of the governing principles of\nDonald Trump’s leadership strategy surround yourself with yes Sears Janice called the phenomenon\nthat occurs when the desire for group consensus is stronger than the urge to express an unpopular opinion group think\nif this happens the group is at risk of making very poor decisions\nand even more if many people are too sure of the same thing they become radical and imprudent\nresearchers have observed this phenomenon among jury members the greater the consensus the harsher the\njudgment and the sure the jury is that its verdict is correct when does groupthink occur typically\nwhen there is High group cohesiveness high pressure to make a good decision\nstrong persuasive directive leadership how can we avoid groupthink Janna\nsuggested several steps for preventing groupthink here are two great recommendations if you are the leader of\na team one give a high priority to airing objections and doubts\nin other words encourage all group members to speak their mind even and especially if\nthe opinion is unpopular two divide your team into two informed\ncompeting teams to study the same problem compare results\nwhen all think alike no one is thinking Walter lippman 10. the power method\nwhen the Force is with you most theories in this book argue that good communication has to do with\ncooperation but in reality it’s sometimes a different story it is no\ncoincidence that the book The 48 Laws of Power a compilation of classic\npower strategies by the American author Robert Greene was a bestseller borrowing\nfrom this book here are some negotiating strategies that won’t make you popular but might help you come\nout on top warning even if you prefer to convince people with good\narguments rather than by mean tactics you should know these tricks because they are bound to be used\nagainst you never argue hesitantly if you are unsure about something try\nnot to show it to others doubt and hesitation will only dilute\nyour arguments with for and against formulations your adversary will see an\nopportunity to pounce so only speak up when you’re sure you want to follow through your argument and\nstand your ground even if your plan is flawed we forgive bold people\ntheir mistakes but have no confidence and doubters talk less\ncounter-intuitively you should not try to convince the other person by talking a lot the more you talk the more\ninterchangeable and ordinary your arguments seem every Triumph that you achieve through words is in\nreality appearic Victory because nobody likes to be argued into a corner act\nignorant we tend to be dazzled by intelligence and charisma try the opposite make your\nadversary feel clever he or she will be flattered and become inattentive when your opponent’s guard\ndrops you can attack acting stupid is one of the oldest stratagems around\nas they say in China masquerade as a pig to kill the Tiger give up if you can’t convince somebody\nreassess your own situation what will it cost me if I give up now a smiling\nconfession of your own defeat comes a cross says more self-assured than sullenness\nand what’s more the less interests you show the less satisfied your adversary will feel\noysters open completely when the moon is full and when the crab sees when it throws a piece of stone or\nseaweed into it and the oyster cannot close again so that it serves the crab for\nmeat such is the fate of him who opens his mouth too much and thereby puts\nhimself at the mercy of the listener Leonardo da Vinci 11. Intercultural communication\nhow to negotiate abroad there was once a fin who loved his wife so much that he\nalmost told her it’s a joke and yet not a joke because many Finns are indeed\nintroverted taciturn people anyone who has come into contact with other cultures knows that\nstereotypes and prejudices can’t always be trusted the Scots are Frugal the\nSwiss are punctual the fins are introverted but that they do often contain\na germ of Truth or to put it another way you might say that while many\ncliches are true the more you get to know a culture the more black end white turns to Gray\nin order to get to grips with a culture it is not enough to master the language as cultural idiosyncrasies are more\napparent in the way we communicate then in what we communicate what is required is so-called\nIntercultural communication the term was coined by the Dutch social psychologist geared hofsteed while its\nmost famous proponent is the British linguist Richard D Lewis\nin his classic book when cultures collide 2005 he defines three main cultural\ntypes the linear active the multi-active and the reactive 1. the linear active who include most of\nWestern Europe and the USA talk about as much as they listen have fairly restrained body language\nare polite but direct like to deal in facts and place value on the written\nword they don’t do two things at once two the multi-active such as\nMediterraneans or Saudi Arabians are loquacious gesticulate a lot are\nemotional juggle with facts place value on the spoken word and do many things at\nthe same time three the reactive such as the Japanese Chinese and Koreans speak less and\ntry to get their counterpart to speak first they have very subtle body language are courteous and indirect are\nnon-confrontational and place value on face-to-face communication\nbut contrary to what our schematic categorization might suggest there are no pure alignments only spectrums\nIndians for example are hybrid they are both reactive and multi-active\nCanada is on the borderline between linear active and reactive linear active\nif you are intrigued by the questions what when how many\nmulti-active if you are intrigued by how people communicate and relate to each other\nreactive if you’re convinced by who says it and their experience and Authority\nself and knowledge 12. self-talk how to DARE motivate ourselves\nthere are two kinds of self-talk the first is the unself-conscious Babbling of little children as they play or the\nthinking aloud of contestants in TV shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\nthese types of inner monologue were called egocentric speech by the developmental psychologist Gene Piaget\nhe believed they were a sign of cognitive immaturity today we know that\nthinking aloud is an excellent method for ordering our thoughts and improving concentration\nthe second type of self-talk is the inner dialogue we comment on our\nown behavior in a similar way to a sports commentator reporting on events during a football match the only\ndifference being that the footballers can’t hear the comments whereas we constantly\nhave our internal moderator in our year in the field of psychology this is\nconsidered to be a healthy form of self-evaluation however a distinction is made between\npositive and negative self-talk negative self-talk typically contains one of these thoughts\ngeneralization I have already been left twice people will always leave\nme rash conclusions why doesn’t she call I think she doesn’t like me\nself-blame I should have done differently or I’m a bad father positive self-talk is about breaking\nthrough the above negative patterns of thought it’s not about convincing yourself that life is great but rather\nabout freeing yourself from a cycle of negative thinking for example if you say\nI’ll never manage it ask yourself instead what can I do in order to manage it in a nutshell self-talk serves\ntwo different functions first concentration and second motivation\ntalking to myself is the only way I can be sure of intelligent conversation\nEdmund Blackadder 13. active listening how we are not\nalways all ears paradoxically in our age of constant communication the raw material of\nconversation has actually disappeared listening genuine real listening is a\nrare commodity and a great gift because you are giving to the person you are\nlistening to your most valuable asset your attention here are a few suggestions of how to do\nit right based on the communication technique active listening devised by Carl Rogers and\nRichard Farson in 1957 listen don’t talk as the cartoon here suggests resist\ntalking about yourself or as the radio host Celeste Hadley put it brilliantly\nin a tedx speech if they’re talking about having lost a family member don’t\nstart talking about the time you lost a family member if they’re talking about the trouble they’re having at\nwork don’t tell them about how much you hate your job it’s not the same\nit’s never the same all experiences are individual and more importantly\nit’s not about you don’t finish the other persons some people have a tendency of\nimpatiently finishing the sentence or thought of the person they are talking to although very slow thinking end\ntalking can be irritating don’t interrupt even if you think it might show empathy your body language says a lot\nlook the other person in the eye but don’t stare not but only a few\nwant to agree with what they are saying or show that you have understood something important\nnotice the little things listen out for details and what they are saying and pick up on these later\nthis makes it easier to ask questions you mentioned that you spent a lot of\ntime as a child at your Grandmother’s what kind of relationship did you have with her and it lets the other person\nknow that you were really listening be a friend not a judge\nresist the impulse of giving the other person advice unless of course they specifically ask for it\ninstead take the conversation back to an exciting important part of the story earlier you\nsaid that take the person away from the smooth surface to deeper levels how was it for you when you or encourage\nthe person to keep talking by simply asking and what happen next\nthe most romantic gift to listen to another’s anxieties for one hour without judgment or Solutions as an\nanalyst might a land de botan 14. small talk\nhow to start a conversation with strangers small talk is actually something very\nbig those who manage to Star day conversation with strangers break the\nice and treat them like friends have the world at their feet see spruce’s questionnaire but it’s incredibly\ndifficult there has been little serious Research into the art of small talk and\nthere are few reliable theories but nonetheless here are some practical tips ask for advice\npeople love giving advice so start your small talk with the request for\nadvice I want to buy a smartphone or a cocktail or a book but I can’t\ndecide which one most people will happily open up then thank them for\nthe tip and the other person will feel like a fireman who has successfully extinguished a fire\nthe psychology behind this if you ask for advice you create intimacy intimacy makes rejection\ndifficult therefore if you want to influence someone it is a good idea to ask that\nperson for advice first ask a second question we often ask something and then wait for\nthe other person to ask something back this is not a conversation\ninstead use the old reporter trick and ask a second question if you just asked where did you grow up\nthen a good follow-up question might be how has that place shaped you don’t ask what do you\ndo for a living there are two kinds of people those who like to talk about their job and go\non and on about it and those who are ashamed of their job hate it or don’t have one the latter are reluctant to\ntalk about this topic the author Gretchen Rubin suggests this simple but powerful tweak to the usual\nwhat do you do for a living job question what’s keeping you busy these\ndays now the other person can choose what to talk about don’t start a conversation about things\nthat interest you most people like to talk about themselves this leads to us not listening any more\nbut simply waiting for our turn to speak but a conversation is not a PowerPoint\npresentation don’t pitch your topics rather be the one person\nin the group who is interested in the other person’s topics as Bill Nye put\nit everyone you’ll ever meet knows something that you don’t listen the way people deal with you depends on\nhow you present yourself arrogant worldly wise or dull posturing brings out the same behavior in your\ncounterpart the Supreme rule when making small talk comes from the radio host Celeste Hedley\nenter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn people forget what they talked about\nwith you but not how they felt in your presence we have two ears and only one mouth so\nthat we can listen twice as much as we speak Epictetus</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the iceberg model what happens below the surface one of the most frequently cited and</li>\n</ol>\n<p>simplest but also most inscrutable of all communication theories is the iceberg Theory\nSigmund Freud the founder of psychoanalysis believed that human behavior is governed Above All by the\nunconscious like an iceberg where only the tip protrudes from the water\nwhile the usually much bigger end mostly invisible part is below the surface\nat this point it should be mention that we do not know for sure who came up with this brilliant\nmetaphor it certainly wasn’t Freud some say it was Hemingway who in the 1930s\nclaimed that an author does not have to explicitly reveal the deeper meaning of a story see the six-word rule it is\nsufficient if like an iceberg only a tenth is visible above water\nif we apply this rule to communication we could say that divisible conscious part of a discussion is the\nfactual level what we say or what we talk about while the unconscious part is\nthe interpersonal level how we say it and what we really mean see lasswell’s communication model\nand what’s the exaxium theory this means we can control the factual\nlevel we can select our words consciously but our gestures facial expression and tone of voice will betray\nour unconscious secret hopes repressed conflicts traumatic experiences base motives and animal\ninstincts and appeal to the other person’s unconscious the interpersonal\nlevel decides how we will be perceived and how we perceive others the more we know about another person’s\nvalues patterns of behavior motives in other words the more we see\nof the iceberg the better we can understand the person’s words and actions\nthe best way to lower the water line of your opponent or partner is to show more of yourself\nif you for example want someone to admit something start by talking honestly\nabout your own mistakes fear and hope are alike underneath Richard Ford</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the spiral of Silence why we don’t dare State our opinion let</li>\n</ol>\n<p>us assume that you have a five hour train ride ahead of you and in your crowded compartment of person starts\ntalking about tightening the asylum laws would you like to talk to this person or\nnot this is the railway test which the German social scientist Elizabeth\nNoelle Newman used to examine who sticks up for their opinion in public and who doesn’t\nher hypothesis the willingness of people to voice there opinion in public dwindles in situations\nwhere they believe that the majority opinion is different from their own in other words we do not like to be of a\ndifferent opinion to others if we notice that the group majority has a different opinion to ours we remain\nsilent this phenomenon is called the spiral of silence and can be explained by these\nsix points of which the last two are arguably the most important\none most people have a fear of isolation and observe the behavior of others\nto assess which opinions will be accepted or rejected We Fear isolation\nmore than being wrong wrote Alexis de Taco in the 19th century</p>\n<ol>\n<li>we exert pressure on each other we pull a face roll our eyes or turn</li>\n</ol>\n<p>away when someone says something that does not comply with the prevailing opinion 3. fear of isolation and a\npressure to conform occur unconsciously we do not think about the extent to which we\nare Guided by public opinion four we tend to conceal our opinion if we think that it will expose us to group\npressure if we feel public support however we tend to express our\nopinion loudly and clearly 5. if consensus on a subject prevails in\na group it is unlikely that a spiral of silence will begin six the number of people who share an\nopinion is not necessarily significant a minority opinion can appear to be a\nmajority opinion if it’s proponents appear confident enough and represent their opinion in public\nforcefully we become quieter if we believe that we are in the minority</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the speech act Theory how words can trigger actions you can do an incredible</li>\n</ol>\n<p>amount with words how to do things with words is also the name of the well-known book\nby the British philosopher J L Austin from 1962 in which he\nsubstantiated language Theory he argued that in day-to-day life we distinguish between doing and\ntalking but that there is in fact no difference speaking is also an action\nhis thesis sentences have a propositional meaning this is the information\ncontained in the sentence which can be true or false but sentences also\nhave an elocutionary meaning this means that we are doing something when we speak including something\nessential doing something insane something examples include requests warnings\nthreats recommendations such an elocution can succeed or fail\nfor example if you don’t take the speaker seriously the act of speaking\nhas failed then there is a third dimension the persecution\nhere it is about the extent to which whatever was said has consequences so\nwhether the person being addressed acts on what is said or has a change of mind because of it doing\nsomething by saying something let’s take an example if you say to a couple who happen to be\nsitting next to you I hereby declare you husband and wife then the proposition\nis the same as what a vicar would say at a marriage ceremony in a church the difference the sentence is just\nwords but spoken by a vikr the sentence has weight and effect it is illitutionary\nand seals the marriage and with a bit of luck it is also prolecutionary if the married couple\nstick to their vows and Future the sentence of the vicar thereby triggers subsequent\nactions the speed check Theory explained in two sentences what do we do when\nwe speak what impact do we have when we speak 18. the social judgment Theory which of\nour opinions never change a question that continues to preoccupy researchers into communication is\nthis when do people allow themselves to be persuaded about something and when\nnot why is it that some of our attitudes are deeply ingrained and not up for\ndiscussion EG allegiance to a particular football club Huawei change others at\nthe drop of a hat favorite TV series for example an explanation is offered by the social\njudgment Theory according to this Theory there are three factors that play a role\nin persuading us to change our opinion one The Anchor Point this is\nour basic preferred attitude this attitude is hard to budge and we are unlikely to\nchange it regardless of what information we are given so for example if we were to discover\nthat the players of our favorite football team were manipulating games we might be shocked but it wouldn’t put an\nend to our long love affair 2. room for maneuver here it is about which alternative attitudes we find\nacceptable regardless of Our Own these are attitudes that we can except without having to hoist our\nanchor this approach can lead to a change of opinion in the long term\nthree ego involvement the most complicated part what does our ego have\nto say take the death penalty for example which clearly contradicts the Anchor Point\nhuman rights leaving little room for maneuver but it is conceivable that if we were personally\naffected by a murder we might feel vengeful towards the perpetrator and change our mind at least\nbriefly the stronger our anchor our firm position on an issue the harder it is\nto be persuaded by a different opinion the stronger you pull at another person’s anchor the stronger their\nresistance how can you can succeed anyway see six principles of persuasion Dot\nif you can’t change your mind then you’re not using it 19. the story Matrix\nhow to apologize properly so that the other person forgives and forgets\napologizing is one of the most difficult interpersonal communication situations\na few years ago a team of researchers from Ohio State University tackled this issue and played\nthrough a variety of approaches we translate their findings into strategies\nuse I sentences apologizing means taking on full responsibility for something\nsentences like I’m sorry that your feelings were hurt or I’m sorry that you’re so\nangry should be avoided because what you’re implying is it doesn’t have anything to do with me that your\nfeelings are hurt say it like it is I’m sorry that I hurt your feelings\naccording to the research a person is most likely to forgive and forget if you\nadmit full responsibility for what you did don’t justify your actions\nit is a natural reflex to try to justify your own actions but also an idiotic one because a\njustification is an effective denial of the apology the following sentences are particularly\ncounterproductive come on it wasn’t that bad or I can help it the injured\nperson will be more inclined to forgive if you come up with a reason rather than a justification try to\nexplain your action without being defensive most effective of all iron\nexplanation and an admission of guilt combined avoid but sentences an apology in which\nthe word but crops up is almost never understood as an apology but as an excuse\navoid at all costs don’t ask for forgiveness asking for forgiveness is rarely\neffective according to the research you can spare yourself to bother nobody\nlikes to Grant absolution change yourself even the most honest apology is\nworthless if you repeat the same mistake three times making an apology is above all a\ncommitment to making a change in an offer to make amends when it comes to apologies keep in mind there\nare only two ways you can apologize begrudgingly or sincerely\nchoose the latter 20. White Lies how to answer the question how do I look\nthe truth is all people lie in certain situations such as when we are under\npressure have to justify ourselves or want to make a good impression we\ntend more towards fibbing and telling Tales than when we feel relaxed and self-secure but from an ethical point of\nview not every lie is bad you might for example lie in order to protect someone\nin communication Theory lies fall into two categories do I benefit from the lie or does the\nperson I lied to benefit this results in four different outcomes one white lie only the person lied to\nbenefits this is a fine selfless lion which you risk potential loss to help\nsomeone out here you typically put yourself in the position of the person and for example Defender\nexistence of Santa Claus and the knowledge that the LIE will be exposed in due time\nthis altruistic lie gives us a good feeling 2. gray lie both the liar and the person\nlied to benefit you’ve lost weight gray lies are often part of cultural\nnorms in many situations when you ask how are you you expect a\nlie in response thank you things are great three black lie only the liar benefits\nalthough you are guilty you reject all accusations no I didn’t take the money\nit is often also a bold promise a proactive lie if I am elected\nI will never raise taxes here bare-faced lying is used to your own advantage\nfor red lie no one benefits this is the lowest form of lying\nsaying something with complete awareness that the other person knows the statement to be false even if you\nsometimes end up also inflicting damage on yourself the largest audience\never to witness in inauguration if you tell the truth you don’t have to\nremember anything Mark Twain love and friendship 22. what’s the ex-axium theory how\nrelationships fail an axiom is a valid truth that needs no proof at the end of\nthe 1960s the communication theorist Paul waslowick together with other\nresearchers came up with five axioms to explain how interpersonal communication\nespecially in relationships fails one you cannot not communicate a man\ncomes home sits down stares into space and is silent his wife\nlooks at him and asks him how he is he says nothing and yet he communicates\nsomething it is immediately clear that something must have happened\neven if you say nothing you are saying something 2. all communication has a relationship\naspect and a Content aspect the content aspect is what we say the relationship aspect includes how we\nsay things but also who says something see Schultz fontans communication model\nwho says something and how it is said always way heavier than what is said if we are\noffended by a complete stranger it affects us less than if our partner offends us\nalso keep in mind Albert Moravian seven percent 38 percent 55 rule if we are\ntalking to someone about our feelings this is the impact our words tone of voice and body language\nhave our words are seven percent our tone of voice 38 and our body\nlanguage 55 responsible for whether that person likes us three communication is always about\ncause and effect a woman is annoyed because her partner is grumbling the man is\ngrumbling because the woman is annoyed in other words we sell them quarrel with\nourselves it will always take two to tango 4. human communication makes use of\nanalog and digital modalities in Watson’s terms digital means verbally\nand analog means non-verbally in other words eye rolling a smug smile ambiguous\nintonation if the two levels do not correlate then we’re not on the same page</p>\n<ol>\n<li>communication is symmetric or complementary relationships between partners are</li>\n</ol>\n<p>either symmetrical equal or complementary unequal symmetric means\nthat we talk at a level in the relationship complementary means that there is a kind of hierarchy\nfor example between teacher and pupil if we do not agree whether the\ncommunication is complementary or symmetrical it becomes problematic\neveryone hears what you say friends listen to what you say best friends\nlisten to what you don’t say 23 proves questionnaire how to ask good\nquestions in the late 19th century light conversation or small talk in modern\nEnglish see Small Talk was crucial to the success of an evening being refined was not about saying the\nright thing without having to think to hard nor was it about getting the other person to laugh at one’s Charming\nwitty remarks instead the ideal neighbor at a dinner party was the one\nwho had mastered the Fine Art of asking questions the explanation for this\nis simple and truthful and can be summed up with this rule we do not\nappreciate those who are brilliant but those who make us feel brilliant but because it is extremely difficult to ask\nthe right question in the right situation a small crib sheet soon circulated around European salons\nit consisted of questions that seemed innocent but which beared the soul such\nas who would you prefer to be how would you like to die and which characteristics do you most\nappreciate in a man the author of The questionnaire remains unknown to this\nday in 1885 Marcel pruz then only 13 years old answered the\nquestionnaire at his friend Antoinette for his birthday party in 1924 for his son published proof\nsensors since then it has been known as prust’s questionnaire the fact that he didn’t\ninvent it but simply filled it in speaks in favor of the charm of the above rule\nproof’s questions have three key qualities one they are open questions that you\ncannot answer with yes or no two the questions require no prior knowledge in other words there are no\nright or wrong answers only honest ones three they are questions that Center on\nyour counterpart rather than on you we all admire people who give good answers but we admire those who ask\ngood questions even more the people we remember most are the ones who really listen</p>\n<ol>\n<li>non-violent communication why we find it difficult to be friendly</li>\n</ol>\n<p>psychologists generally agree that conflicts need to be dealt with but the question is how the American\npsychologist Marshall B Rosenberg 1934-2015 developed the idea of\nnon-violent communication based on the premise that it’s not what you say but how you say it he distinguishes between\nspeaking snappishly language of the Jackal and speaking from the heart language of the giraffe\ngiraffes have the biggest heart of any land animal this may sound like mumbo jumbo but it\ncomes closer to reality then most management jargon the language of the Jackal causes the\nspeaker to feel Superior and the person being addressed to feel bad typical examples of Jackal language\nanalysis that’s wrong because criticism the mistake you made was that\nyou interpretations you do that because appraisals your smart slash lazy you’re\nright slash wrong threats if you don’t do it immediately I’ll have to\naccording to Rosenberg statements like these are desires and disguise because we have not learned to ask for\nsomething politely or to express our wishes constructively we resort to aggressive language\nand aggression leads to counter-aggression or submissive subjugation giraffe language on the other hand works\nlike this observe without evaluating you always look out of the window when I want to\ntalk to you acknowledge and Define your own or others feelings I’m worried\nacknowledge needs and take them seriously I want to know how you are doing\nExpress clear and achievable objectives based on these needs please tell me what you need so that we can talk\nabout it but why is it so difficult to be friendly often we ourselves are the problem\ntake the so-called attribution error if we arrive late there was a lot of traffic\nif others arrive late they set off too late or for people with a negative frame of mind the other way\nround we are by Nature prone to pass judgment and what’s more it is\neasier to blame someone else than to think about why something happened the essence of normal communication we\nall like to be right the essence of non-violent communication we are\nbetter off if we resolve a dispute then if we win it or in the words of Marshall Rosenberg\nwould you rather be right or happy 25. The Cooperative principle\nhow we should express ourselves in order to be understood people’s three biggest fears loving\nsomeone without being loved in return searching for friends and not finding any saying something and not being\nunderstood there is no solution to the first two for the third there is at\nleast the principle the British philosopher Paul Grice 1913-88 dedicated his life to this\nproblem and in 1975 finally formulated the so-called Cooperative principle a\nbasic rule for effective communication make your conversational contributions\nsuch as is required at the stage at which it occurs by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk\nExchange in which you are engaged you might be thinking that Grace could have done with\nsome language training himself but let’s take a closer look at what the cooperative\nprinciple is actually all about according to Grice speaker and listener\nwant two and have to behave cooperatively this means that one person wants to be\nunderstood the other to understand in order for this to work Grace proposed for conversational maxims\none maxim of quantity say enough for your counterpart to understand but don’t\nsay too much or you will cause confusion two maximum quality tell the truth don’t\nspeculate don’t dupe the person into believing something different three maximum of relevance don’t say\nanything irrelevant don’t change the subject for maximum of manner avoid ambiguity\nvagueness verbosity and volatility and stick to a logical argument\nif we follow these maxims then as a general rule we will be understood\nbut what happens if we don’t follow them which is the case in most of our conversations\nwe can violate the maxims without being noticed that’s called lying did you\nwreck the car no I didn’t although you did we can violate the maxims\ndeliberately by saying something else but Expecting The Listener to understand the message correctly\nthat’s called flouting a typical form is irony you\nlook out of the window to see the storm intensify you then turn to your friend and say\nwhat wonderful weather we can refrain from cooperation\nthat’s called opting out if you say my lips are sealed this implies you know\nsomething but won’t talk about it and this will end all communication\nonly say what is true and important and express it clearly and simply</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the expectancy violations Theory how much distance we keep from other people</li>\n</ol>\n<p>perhaps you know the feeling you’re sitting in the cinema the film hasn’t started yet the auditorium is barely a\nthird full and several rows are completely empty someone comes in looks around walks past\nthe empty seats and sits down right next to you the feeling that you now have is\ncalled expectancy violation you expected something different that the person would find an empty seat not\none right next to you in 1985 the American Judy burgoon\ndeveloped the expectancy violations Theory which analyzes how our expectations of\nanother person affect the way we respond to unanticipated violations of these expectations or social norms\naccording to burgoon the following rules apply in the Western World with regard to keeping our distance\none intimate space Elbow Room up to 50 centimeters within this space we expect\nto be touched by the other person it is reserved for close family lovers\nand pets 2. personal space 50 to 120\ncentimeters the typical distance we keep from somebody we are talking to\nthree social space 120 to 360 centimeters\nthe distance we keep from people we do not know with whom we do not communicate but\nwhom we have nothing against four public space 360 centimeters or\nmore this distance is best explained if we ask ourselves which people do we avoid\nof course it is not only about distance but also about physical and I contact\nif someone turns away from us while we are speaking it violates our expectations of the conversation\nthis is most easily observed in romantic relationships where the usage\nof smartphones and social media is for many a strong sign of divided attention and a source for trouble\nthe distance we keep is also influenced by cultural and situational norms\ndifferent distance rules apply to dancing in a club and studying in a Library\nin Switzerland people greet one another with three little kisses in the USA this would be regarded as too\nclose for comfort When in Rome do as the Romans do 27. Schultz Fawn thun’s communication\nmodel why we should talk to each other about how we talk to each other it’s an archetypal misunderstanding a\ncouple are sitting in a car in the traffic lights turn green without the driver noticing the passenger says it’s\ngreen the driver replies testily am I driving or you this example comes from Friday man\nSchultz fonthan his communication Square does not count as a\ntheory in the narrower sense but it breaks down the many pitfalls of communication in a clear away then\nother approaches according to Thun every message has four layers</p>\n<ol>\n<li>content what I am informing myself about 2. appeal what I want to achieve</li>\n<li>relationship my relationship to the receiver 4. self-disclosure what I show of myself</li>\n</ol>\n<p>our example contains the content layer the traffic light is green the appeal\nlayer come on drive an allusion to the relationship the passenger wants to help\nthe driver and the self-disclosure layer the passenger is probably in a hurry\nthese are the four facets of the senders message the person receiving the message in this\ncase the driver does so with his own four years on the content layer the traffic light\nis green the two people are still in agreement but the driver interprets the\nappeal come on Drive differently I.E why are you so slow and finds this\ninsulting he reacts accordingly am I driving or you we encounter this kind of flawed\ncommunication all the time hey what’s this in the soup if you don’t like it eat bread\nwhen will you be ready stop hassling me the way we understand messages is\ndetermined by the sender’s end receiver’s previous history the context the tone and many other nonverbal\nsignals how can we solve misunderstandings by talking to each other\nabout how to talk to each other in other words by practicing meta communication\nbecause good communication occurs when intention end understanding are in harmony\nwhat is thought is not always said what is said is not always heard what is\nheard is not always understood what is understood is not always agreed\nwhat is agreed is not always done what is done is not always done

some lousy diplomacy the logic of this period was\nthe clever side never gives an end comes out on top to when you have to take action not\nnegotiate Europe was in Ruins by the time the game was over\nduring this period John Von Neumann a mathematician an Oscar Morgenstern an economist developed their\nfamous game theory this Theory examines conflicts in which the result for all participants depends on\ndecisions made by others as in negotiations game theory is based on the observation\nthat people in conflicts behave in the same way as they would when playing a board game they want to win but do so by\nsticking to the rules of the game otherwise it won’t work how do you win\nbut still follow the rules the solution by approaching and talking\nto each other or in the words of game theorists by cooperating\nlet’s take a simple example at some point most adults decide not to give\neach other Christmas presents anymore the pressure to consume is annoying and in any case what do you\ngive a person who has everything but typically some people still do buy a present even if they agreed not to\nthe person who gets the gift but didn’t give one in return now has a bad conscience the person who gave but\ndidn’t receive is disappointed the results conflict there are only two logical Solutions and\nboth have to do with communication you have to decide whether a everyone or B nobody\ngets a gift but this super simple Game Theory solution can only be\nachieved if both sides go along with the plan and if they make a binding agreement to stick to it two complex\nactions that people find hard to carry out meeting jaw to jaw is better than War\nWinston Churchill 29 second order observation\nhow your therapist talks to you what does your therapist do when talking to you\nhe or she makes a so-called second order observation A first order Observer sees\nthe world as it appears to him or her the world is simply there the second order Observer however\nascribes what the first order Observer sees to how it is seen important we cannot observe\nourselves observing which is also why therapists can’t treat themselves this is often referred to as the blind\nspot in other words we are unaware of the way in which we observe we cannot see that\nwe cannot see so by identifying someone’s blind spot the\nsecond order Observer might open up A New Perspective and make that person aware for example of the fact that\nhe or she could just as easily see something differently an example a couple want to move in\ntogether but she has one of those flats that you simply wouldn’t want to give up a great location low rent a\nbig balcony and the flat would be big enough for two he hesitates\nbecause he feels that he would be intruding and that it would still feel like her flat they cannot afford a new flat\nfor the two of them she sees only the potential advantages of her flat he\nsees only the potential disadvantages both are first order observers and are\ntalking at Cross purposes a second order Observer could give them another perspective the couple\ncould move into the woman’s flat but on the condition that it becomes a shared flat that they move into as if it\nwere new this means she has to First move out of her flat before the two of\nthem move and then refurbish it despite the fact that most people constantly think about themselves it is\nimpossible to observe yourself while doing or thinking something we can\nonly train ourselves to be more aware of moments when we act or think according to old and bad habits but in\norder to recognize these patterns we need a second Observer we can’t see that we are seeing\nsomething 30. transactional analysis which ID used to communicate\nhere are two of the greatest interpreters of human communication Sigmund Freud\n1856-1939 the founder of psychoanalysis believed that hidden pleasures and fears\nfrom our childhood are the motivation behind our communication problems the psychiatrist Eric Byrne\n1910-70 however believed that you do not have to go on a painful journey into\nyour past to get to know yourself it is enough to observe yourself in communication with others in 1964 Byrne\nproposed in his book games people play a counter model to Freud’s theory a book which due to its\nSimplicity and Clarity became a bestseller in the genre of communication and self-help books\naccording to burn it all starts with the three ego States we adopt in relation to others</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the parent-ego state we all are a little like our parents this is evident</li>\n</ol>\n<p>when we patronize others or tell them what they should or should not do but also when we act thoughtfully\nempathically or helpfully 2. the adult ego State we act like\nadults when we communicate in a considered controlled and relaxed way\nin other words when we treat the other party respectfully and respond to criticism factually and\nconstructively three the child ego State we also carry and ask the child that we once were\nwe are unrepentant defiant silly or anxious but positive qualities such as\nimagination curiosity and learning are also evident in our childlike\ncommunication all states occur in one person so what uses transactional analysis in\npractice when we communicate it is always from one of these ego States\nwe are not always aware of this but it is most evident when we observe ourselves\nlet’s suppose that a proposal we put forward in a discussion is rejected by the group\nif we react in an offended way or respond defiantly we are in child mode if we weigh things\nup rationally and realize that our proposal was no good we are in the adult mode\nbut if we argue morally that the others are wrong because we are right we are in parent mode\nif communication does not work you should ask yourself what state am I and\nat the moment paronygo adult ego or child ego 31 parenting tips\nhow to talk to Children even if you don’t have any of your own if you’ve ever asked a child how was\nschool today or tried to explain to a toddler that it shouldn’t feed washing\npowder to the cat you know that good communication can be more complicated than algebra so here are\nsome tips from parenting experts be a role model actions speak louder than words\na child won’t understand that he shouldn’t scream if you scream at him correct content not form the child says\nI draw horsey that’s fine as long as she is drawing a horse\nbe consistent no means no even when the child is having a tantrum at the\nsupermarket checkout loophole only make threats that you can go back on without losing face\nso don’t say if you don’t stop right away we won’t go away on holiday\nImplement threats immediately children learn more quickly and effectively if you carry out your\nthreats straight away instead of taking away a toy once for a whole week long\nduration small effect it is better to take away the toy 10 times for two\nminutes small duration big effect praise and action not the child what\nyou’re doing is great is better then you’re great ignore bad behavior when a child does\nnot behave according to your expectations but isn’t putting himself or others in danger it is better to\nignore him then to rebuke him selective attention offer Alternatives give your child\ndifferent options but never more than two and only if an alternative makes\nsense there is no alternative to teeth brushing tell a child what she should do\nand not what she shouldn’t do it’s better to say please slow down then\ndon’t run ask questions that can be

while you are thinking about it Daniel Kahneman\nwords and meanings 33 the framing effect what kind of image we have of the world\nin communication there is a fundamental rule how something is set in by whom the narrative context or frame\ndetermines how something is understood to take one example if a sensational\npiece of news is printed in a reputable newspaper we are more inclined to\nbelieve it than if it is reported in a tabloid this observation was made by Irving Goffman who described\nthis form of interpretation as framing if we look at a picture in the museum we know\nthat it is Art even if it looks like a stick figure drawn by a child this is because we have learned to\nrecognize the frame Modern Art another example if we go to a restaurant we know\nhow to behave how to interact with the waiter how to handle a knife in\nfork and what to do with it menu we know this because we know the frame\nrestaurant in his seminal work the Presentation of Self in Everyday Life Goffman uses the\nimagery of theater and acting to describe human social interaction he believes that we each adapt our\nBehavior to each frame and are therefore a different person in each situation\nthis means that there is no such thing as authenticity we are one person when we are at work\nanother when we talk to our parents and quite another when we are lost in a foreign city and have\nto communicate with strangers Daniel Kahneman and Amos firsky famously\nshowed how different ways of phrasing frame a dilemma and affect people’s responses to a\nchoice this logic is used to great effect in advertising for example two\nyogurts are on sale one is 90 fat free and the other is touted as having\na ten percent fat content although both contain equal quantities of fat people\ntend to choose the yogurt advertised is almost fat-free because the frame for the yogurt purports that it is\na fat free healthier product the bottom line is we seldom make rational\nchoices there are no objective or authentic messages everything that is being\ncommunicated is always framed and if you want to decode a message try\nto understand the frame 34. mcluhan’s media Theory\nwhy the medium is the message the Canadian media scholar Marshall mcluhan\n1911-80 who generally shunned the Limelight became the world’s most talked about intellectual in\n1967 this was because he had summed up the media Revolution the transition from\nprint to TV in a single sentence the medium is the message\nthe sentence is not as simple as it first appears what does it mean it does not mean what\nyou might initially think I that the medium has become more important than its message\na hint mcluhan’s theories never focus on the obvious clear-cut or logical\nrather the sentence means that the medium is not important because of its message but because it can\nchange our Behavior our thinking and our lives and what does that mean if we use\nthe word medium we are usually only referring to the channel via which information is transmitted mcluhan\nbelieved that this channel is more formative for our culture than the message it carries\nIf the message changes we simply change our minds but when the medium changes we change\nour Behavior this sounded crazy in the 1960s but since the Advent of social media and\nsince we have started to reflect on the ways in which mobile devices dominate our everyday lives it makes much more\nsense suddenly his meaning is Crystal Clear it’s not what we read on our\nsmartphone that changes our Behavior but that we are reading it on our smartphone\nwhat makes our smartphone so fascinating that we stroke it more than our newborn\nchild see the uses and gratifications Theory Dot we shape our tools and the\ntools shape us wrote mcluhan he also wrote people don’t really read\nnewspapers they just climb into them every morning like into a hot bath\nwas there ever a better description for the internet in his time McLean was taken more\nseriously by hippies then academics this was a double misunderstanding\nbecause as a conservative Catholic he was opposed to the media developments he\ndescribed the news doesn’t change us the medium does take a minute and make a\nlist the five things that have changed in your behavior since using a smartphone\nnow ask yourself what changes do you regret and finally what would it take to undo them\n35 the efomo phenomenon what happens if you don’t look at your smartphone\nthe internet has multiplied the number of ways in which we communicate while we still communicate one to one in\na personal email for example we now also often communicate one to many EG in a Facebook post store\nWhatsApp group message one of the most important elements of online communication is\nself-presentation we only want to show our best side we post photos of perfectly prepared\ndishes perfect holidays perfect parties perfect scores and this starts a vicious circle\nwhenever we feel bored or alone we look at our smartphone\nbut what are we looking for we basically want to see that others have seen us a like a share a retweet is\nproof of that but when looking at social media we also see the Apparently perfect lives of our\nfriends which we are not part of and how these lives are being liked and shared\nscientists call the uneasy and sometimes all-consuming feeling that we’re missing\nout that our peers are doing or in possession of more or something better than we are\nfear of missing out or fomo hey team of psychologists at the University\nof Essex led by Andy prabilski came up with this name\npeople under the age of 35 suffer more from this phenomenon men more than women teenagers more than\nadults unhappy more than happy people to clarify it’s not a question of really\nmissing out on something it’s about the feeling of having missed out on something\nweave all been there when we’re feeling down bored or stressed out we check\nour smartphone but all this does is make us feel even worse\nsmartphones act like an accelerant when it comes to fomo and thereby corroborate\nfifty-year-old mcluhan’s media Theory the medium is the message in the 20th century I think therefore I\nam no longer applies but rather others are thinking of me therefore I am Peter\nsloted 36 laswell’s communication model\nhow to recognize fake news the term fake news has become ubiquitous\nin recent years but what is fake news basically it is an aggressive way to\ninfluence people but fake or not all news is influencing\nsomething which the inventor of public relations Edward L Bernays took full\nadvantage of fun fact Bernice was the nephew of Sigmund Freud founder\nof psychoanalysis his most famous work which he wrote in 1927 was\noriginally entitled propaganda but he later changed the name to public relations\nBernice wrote the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions\nof the masses is an important element in Democratic Society we are\ngoverned our minds molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested\nlargely by men we have never heard of it’s a pretty good description of the\nworld we live in isn’t it but how should we interpret Bernie’s as strangely euphoric sounding text\nlike this freedom of expression is a democratic right when everyone\nexpresses their opinion millions of opinions and interests Collide and chaos\nensues so either you create order out of the chaos by implementing restrictions which would be a\ndictatorship or you have to make your own opinion as attractive as possible and marketed as such\nyou can use all the tricks of the trade to come out on top you can manipulate a little Chi Day\nlittle exaggerate a little to make yourself more interesting ideas can be\npresented as attractive or less attractive and it is up to individuals to decide whether they want to follow\nthem this means PR and advertising or even fake news cannot force us to do anything\nwe don’t want if you want to analyze fake news a good starting point is the lighthearted model\ndeveloped by the American sociologist Harold D Laswell in 1948 which still works astonishingly\nwell today for example to separate fakes from facts the formula is who says what in which\nchannel to whom with what effect who by answering who said it we divert\nour attention to the sender Laswell called this control analysis who is talking what is their aim who are their\nallies what by looking at what is being said we give attention to the actual message the\ncontent analysis to identify the aim behind the message we can for example\nask how are women or people of color represented what does the phrasing imply\nwhich by answering the which channel question we make a media analysis why are they using this channel\nhow can they afford it who paid for it to whom the audience analysis can for\nexample reveal something about the aim of the sender why are they talking specifically to these\npeople with what effect with the effect analysis we ask how did the audience\nreact what does this tell us about the sender Laswell was concerned with the effects\nof mass media but his message also applies to interpersonal\ncommunication his formula is a simple way to sharpen your senses for propaganda\nwherever it’s coming from 37 the uses and gratifications Theory\nwhat we want when we’re online what makes screens so attractive was the question already being asked by\nresearchers in the early days of television in 1960 the sociologist elahu\nKatz claim to have the answer his uses and gratifications theory was\nradically different from other media effect theories he believed that media consumption was\nan active voluntary decision and consequently did not ask what media does to us but what we do\nwith media he identified five reasons why we use media and what we use\nit for spoiler alert the first three reasons are obvious the second two\ninteresting one information and education we consume media to discover\nwhat has happen but also to educate ourselves two entertainment we consume media for\nour emotional or aesthetic pleasure three identification we consume media\nbecause we identify with people we see on screen 4. integration and social interaction we\nconsume media so that later we can talk about what we saw or heard with others\ntoday the so-called second screen comes into play we watch TV and at the same\ntime consume via second screen like a smartphone with a consequence\nthat we are alone and yet not lonely for example hashtag Dr vore\n#strictly see the fomo phenomenon 5. escapism we consume media to escape\nreality everyone is familiar with this Behavior we immerse ourselves\nin a film a game or the internet and forget about ourselves it is important to notice that according\nto this Theory media do not force us into anything we decide for ourselves\nwhat we want to use when I die I want my Tombstone to say free Wi-Fi so people will visit\nmore often 38. the encoding slash decoding model\nhow messages can be understood differently a small but significant question is what\nI can hear the same as what you are saying every child that has ever played Chinese Whispers knows the answer\nnot always one of the greatest communication theorists Stuart Hall 1932-2014\nwas of the same opinion in fact he took the idea further he\nbelieved not only that we are capable of misunderstanding but that we play inactive\nrole in understanding peresi we interpret or decode the same message\ndifferently depending on our social class our level of knowledge and our\ncultural background but above all the way we understand a message also\ndepends on how we want to understand it an example is the cult 1960s TV\nseries Star Trek many fans interpreted the series as a classic science fiction\nAdventure in Space but the gay community saw the close-knit relationships\nbetween the men and the rainbow crew black African Asian Russian\nVulcan as an allusion to the fact that some of the characters were gay it is\nirrelevant that Star Trek’s Creator Jean Roddenberry denied this because according to Stuart Hall the message can\nbe changed once it has been received in other words Star Trek fans\nsaw in the series what they wanted to see the encoding slash decoding model\ncontradicts the classic sender receiver model According to which the recipient\nplays a passive role Paul argued that the way we receive a message is inactive\nand never clear-cut process so that the message can always be understood differently the sender\nencodes the message with a particular intention the receiver decodes the\nmessage in order to understand it and this decoding can happen in three\ndifferent ways 1. dominant hegemonic the desired reading we understand the\nmessage the way it was intended 2. oppositional we oppose or dismiss the intended\nmeaning three negotiated a combination of the two a message is more than just what is said\nit changes depending on how it is understood let’s put this into practice if you are\na leader always make your team repeat to you how they have understood your message\nthat is by the way the reason why co-pilots Always repeat what they just heard the pilot say\n39 visual communication how we interpret science\nwhen we want to communicate something we use signs words gestures\nfacial expressions formulas symbols or traffic signs that the other person\nhas to translate into meaning semiotics is the study of science it is\na cross-section of Sciences from the disciplines of psychology philosophy sociology Linguistics computer science\ndesign art and Mathematics the bottom line is we find signs\neverywhere we come across culture rather than nature the key points in brief\nsome signs the swastika a traffic light the Nike Swoosh are easy to\nspot and more legible than words we see them and understand what is\nmeant a story a rating a command or a message brings to mind\nperception in most people proceeds from image to text we remember drawings Better Than Words recognize\npatterns and representations more than in sentences some of the most important semioticians\nbelieve that all the following are science a Rolls-Royce in front of the door a blue sky a hundred dollar\nnote open shoelaces a half empty or half full glass of water a magic\nformula a traffic jam on the motorway a sunset nothing can be\nperceived merely as what it is it will always have to be interpreted by\nthe viewer as a sign of something the visual is like the political everyone thinks they understand\nsomething about it and to an extent this is true so says the German professor of mass communication Marion G\nMuller she makes sin important point about the design of signs and symbols they are\ncomplex but need to be comprehensible otherwise there can be no communication\nmost people understand complicated matter better through images than in words\nwe remember pictures better than text and are more likely to recognize patterns and images than in\nsentences 40. euphemisms how we obfuscate with\nlanguage speaking in euphemisms is a form of linguistic whitewashing governments\nprefer to speak of enhanced interrogation methods rather than torture\nthe company’s spokesman will not say that staff are being dismissed but that the company is\nrestructuring products are a bargain not cheap if we tell a lie we are simply\nstretching the truth and when we are broke we can give it the fancy expression negative cash flow\nthe opposite of a euphemism when you give something a negative meaning\nis called a dysphemism someone with strong political views will immediately become an extremist\neuphemisms are the stealth bombers of rhetoric at first glance they are not\nvisible but their attacks are Insidious by the time you become aware of them the damage is already done\nthe Nazis loved euphemisms land consolidation instead of expulsion labor\ncamp instead of concentration Camp special action instead of killing\neuphemisms crop up in almost all political and corporate Communications for example a town hall\nmeeting might suggest a friendly local Gathering where everyone can contribute but in fact the co just\nwants to get a particular message across downsizing suggests the sort of\ninevitability to making a company somewhat Cozier in size without mentioning job cuts\neuphemisms are the mother tongue of manipulation as a rule of thumb if\nsomeone doesn’t use straight language don’t act straight away pause before acting\n41 sophism how you can explain practically anything with spurious\ncorrelations in ancient Greece debate was Central to the forming of opinions\na distinction between good and bad reasoning was made good reasoning aims to convince but it\nalso lets itself be convinced simply put it is the search for truth\nbad reasoning has no interest in the truth it is simply about wanting to be\nright Plato called bad reasoning sophistic the sophists claim to be able to\njustify any position to reasoning and logic they aimed at defeating\ntheir opponents and debates using rhetorical strategies see theory of rhetoric and logical arguments the\nsophists were unpopular despised and successful a well-known example is that of yathilis\nwho was educated in sophistry by protagoras they made an\nagreement that yaffles would only have to pay for his instruction after he won his first lawsuit\nbut after his education youthless took up a different profession therefore he did not\nconduct any lawsuits could not win any and argued that he did not have to\npay for his instruction subsequently protagoras sued him and argued sophistically you Atlas will pay\nif he wins the case he will have to pay according to the original agreement and\nif he loses the court will order him to pay you athless protagoras best trained\nsophist replied I will not have to pay on any account because if I lose\nthe case I do not have to pay according to the original agreement and if I win I will owe you nothing\naccording to the verdict it is an ingenious logical argument but also a\ndeliberately induced fallacy esophism now you should not think that sophism\ndied out with the ancient Greeks on the contrary it still exists\nand is in excellent health modern instances of sophism are spurious\nrelationships in Spring storks return from the south in Spring the number of births\ndemonstrably increases the two things must be linked no\nthe two statements correlate but are not causal what’s more they have nothing to\ndo with each other most of you will have heard the maxim correlation does not imply\ncausation just because two variables have a statistical relationship with each other\ndoes not mean that one is responsible for the other for instance ice cream sales and forest fires are\ncorrelated because both occur more often in the summer heat but there is no causation you don’t set\na patch of the Montana brush on fire when you buy a pint of Haagen-Dazs\nNate silver 42 the cultivation Theory how the media\ncorroborates our opinions one of the most frequently cited communication theories is George\ngerbner’s cultivation Theory from 1976 which claims that people who watch a lot\nof Television are more likely to cultivate the belief that reality corresponds with what they are seeing on\nTV he argued that watching a lot of Television changes our perception of\nreality and causes anxiety the mass media in the Past film and TV\nnowadays mostly games and the internet confronts us with an exaggerated stylized world\naccording to gerbner those who consume a lot of media start to see the real world\nin the way it is stylized on screen some examples in everyday life we rarely\nsee a policeman with a drawn gun in a crime drama however it is\nstandard in reality we rarely see violence on screen we see it all the\ntime according to gerbner if we consume these kinds of on-screen images over\na long period of time our perception of reality changes and we begin to\ninternalize it even if we don’t actually see any violence we start to believe\nthe world is a violent place and the more violent and frightening images\nwe see the more anxious we become in our everyday lives so the media influences us\nbut to what extent does it mean for example that excessively playing FPS\nfirst-person shooter games will cause the player to go on a killing spree\nno the media does not form r opinions and beliefs but it does\nreinforce them so somebody who already has violent fantasies will find\naffirmation for them online but somebody who coexists peacefully with others will\nnot turn into a serial killer by watching violent films several nights in a row it is important to remember that\nwe prefer to watch things we enjoy as is demonstrated most clearly by the\nfilter bubble effect on the internet algorithms try to predict what information we will be looking for based\non our interests and opinions that way there is little chance of being\nconvinced by a different opinion because we are unlikely to be served any alternative views\nwhen it comes to decision making this kind of self-confirming information proves a huge risk as explained in the\nchapter on groupthink the cultivation theory has been criticized for its lack of\ncomplexity viewers are regarded as passive and easy to manipulate if you are\ninterested in the opposite view take a look at the encoding slash decoding model\nif you like apples and spend hours watching a TV program about pairs you won’t suddenly prefer pairs\nafterwards but if you already like pears and spend hours watching a program about\npairs you will like pears even more afterwards 43 the standpoint Theory what opinion\nhas to do with power everyone has a voice but not everyone is heard\nthe voices that Prevail are called hegemonic the creation of hegemony has little to do with\ndemocracy and everything to do with power it is not a question of who has\nsomething legitimate or important to say but always of who has sufficient resources and influence in a society to\nDefine their opinion as legitimate or important the hegemonic perspective is considered\nneutral anything that deviates from it is seen as an exception and ascribed to others\nthe hegemonic view claims not to represent a specific point of view position or\nlife experience but rather to represent things as simply the way they are an example the media in the western\nworld is dominated by white male journalists nevertheless the news never announces\ntoday you will hear the news from a white male perspective white and male are not\nexplicitly named they are regarded as general neutral and non-specific\nanother example if a married couple are heterosexual they’re sexual orientation isn’t mentioned if they are\nhomosexual it is the question of hegemonic voices is associated with the concept of which\ntruths prevail here we come to the standpoint Theory who’s most important proponents are Donna haraway\nand Sandra Harding they maintain that a voice or standpoint cannot be objective\nor neutral or exist outside a specific social context\nhere is an example in science and in children’s books to the present day the\nidea that prehistoric people hunted mammoths was long considered to be fact\nprehistoric people or more concretely prehistoric Men set off\non dangerous Mammoth hunting expeditions but in fact this image was created in\nthe 19th century at a time when hunting was no longer essential for survival but\nwas simply a status symbol in their interpretations of prehistory archaeologists\nneglected unspectacular types of food procurements such as Gathering berries and roots or trapping small animals\nthis is not to say that men did not sometimes slay a mammoth but it distorts the fact that they\nmainly collected berries here the historians were not objective\nbut confirmed The Stereotype of men as Brave Fighters Warriors and family Breadwinners as if\nthis were a law of nature bottom line if you believe that you hold an objective\nopinion ask yourself what other points of view were excluded so that yours could prevail\nif you want to make sure that every voice in the room is heard you can ask your team not to express their opinion\nabout a given topic but rather brainstorm different possible opinions\nthat way sooner or later even though unheard voices will appear on the flip chart and once they are up there they\ncan be discussed conclusion 44. the peak and Rule what we remember\nfrom a conversation here’s a question how do we know if a presentation a job interview or a\ndate went well we usually have a good hunch but do we really know\nassessing a date would involve some pretty complicated number crunching we’d have to\ncalculate how we felt how the other person felt what we had expected and\nso on an impossible task it turns out our mind solves this problem by using a\nsurprisingly simple strategy as Lori Santos from Yale University explains brilliantly in a\nlecture when we remember something we ignore most of it actually we\nmake an assessment based only on two parts of the experience 1. the peak I.E the part of the\nexperience that was most extreme either Pleasant or unpleasant two the end I.E whether it got better or\nworse at the end this is important even a small Improvement can\nmake the date seem like an okay experience whereas a poor ending will ruin an otherwise great evening this is\nthe peak and Rule devised in a 1993 study by the Nobel Laureate Daniel\nKahneman and his colleagues how can we use this in our life the peak and Rule gives us some hints\nabout how to make an experience special we often obsess about what kind of first\nimpression we make on people fearing that people might judge us based only on our outward appearance or\nfirst sentences this thinking is based on the famous notion of you only\nhave one chance to make a first impression though this holds true the\nfirst thing we hear about someone influences our Judgment of that person the first price we are quoted forms the\nbasis for the negotiation it is the anchor effect maybe we should start\nobsessing about something else there might be only one chance to make a lasting impression that lasting\nimpression is not necessarily the first impression but rather the last one\nthat is by the way the reason why we binge watch TV shows by ending\non a cliffhanger they have perfected the peak and Rule so when it comes to communication it is\nof course important how we start a meeting how we set the tone how we break the ice\nbut according to kahneman’s work maybe we should start focusing on how we want\nto end the whole damn thing I don’t care about opening sentences\nall I care about is the last sentence it’s the sentence the reader will go to bed with</p>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor

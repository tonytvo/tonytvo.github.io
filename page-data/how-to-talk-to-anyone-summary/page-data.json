Research indicates that “as many as 10,000 units of information flow per second” between individuals.</li>\n<li>Numerous proven techniques can increase your attractiveness and dynamism.</li>\n<li>People learn everything they need to know about you within the first few seconds of meeting you. Meanwhile, you are also forming powerful first impressions.</li>\n<li>You send clear signals about how you feel without saying a word.</li>\n<li>“Fine-tune your smile.”</li>\n<li>To make people feel great about you, focus your conversation on them.</li>\n<li>Many people are as frightened to make small talk as they appear on the stage.</li>\n<li>You will become a far more intelligent speaker if you simply find substitutes for a few “overworked words” such as “smart, nice, pretty or good.”</li>\n<li>we consistently overestimate our ability to judge strangers\n<ul>\n<li>with the smallest glimmer of information, we judge people we don’t know.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>we are incapable of spotting deception\n<ul>\n<li>we assume truthfulness until the evidence pointing toward deception is overwhelming.</li>\n<li>Generally, observers believe that most people are telling the truth. To tip from suspicion to disbelief, observers need an absolutely clear trigger. This could be clear agitation, total avoidance of eye contact or someone struggling to find words when directly accused of cheating. Without that trigger, our suspicions remain just that, and we assume truthfulness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Some people are better at spotting deception, but assuming the truth is important for society to function.\n<ul>\n<li>We can celebrate perceptive skepticism, but for most of us, it doesn’t matter that we can’t spot lies. Defaulting to truth makes sense, and Bernie Madoff and Ana Montes are outliers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Life isn’t like an episode of Friends – what you see on people’s faces doesn’t tell the whole story.\n<ul>\n<li>Transparency is the idea that someone’s demeanour reveals an authentic picture of their feelings. It’s one of the primary expectations we have when judging strangers. The problem is that transparency is often completely misleading.</li>\n<li>When strangers aren’t transparent, we easily and completely misjudge them.</li>\n<li>some people simply aren’t transparent. They’re mismatched, or their demeanour doesn’t reflect what they’re thinking.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alcohol can make interactions between strangers far worse, with terrible consequences\n<ul>\n<li>And a murky situation gets even murkier when alcohol is involved. The author believes that alcohol causes people to become myopic. Alcohol makes us disproportionately focus on short-term wants and forget about long-term consequences. Normally, we maintain a balance between the two.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are some ways we can get better, and the best way to start is to stop making assumptions</li>\n<li><strong>Humans are ill-equipped to understand strangers. We assume that people tell the truth, so we can’t detect lies. And we believe that we can judge strangers based on little, usually deceptive, information. The result of this misplaced confidence is that we don’t invest enough time and patience in truly listening to and understanding each other.</strong></li>\n<li>evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin believed that similar, easily interpreted expressions – of joy, sadness, fear, surprise, and the like – were consistent for all peoples and cultures. These things are not consistent at all, which explains why people can’t accurately gauge strangers’ emotions or intent across – or even within – cultures</li>\n<li><strong>Circumstances, Conditions and Context</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Gladwell affirms that you must face the additional problem of context beyond your inability to read strangers’ emotions and your powerful bias to believe what they tell you. Where and when you meet a stranger, he emphasizes, matters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"clever-hans-the-counting-horse\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#clever-hans-the-counting-horse\" aria-label=\"clever hans the counting horse permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“Clever Hans, the Counting Horse”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In Europe during the halcyon years before World War I, “Clever Hans, the counting horse,” was, without a doubt, the most talked-about sensation on the continent. A brilliant entertainer with a unique act, Hans could somehow supply accurate answers to math questions that audience members posed to him. He quickly tapped out the correct answers to any problem – addition, subtraction, multiplication and division – with a hoof. The horse’s owner, Herr von Osten, was always by his side while Hans performed these seemingly miraculous feats – but he never spoke to the horse or signalled him in any way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No one had ever seen such an amazing animal! Expanding beyond math, Hans “learned the alphabet.” By tapping his hoof several times for each letter, he would answer questions from audience members concerning the latest news or subjects such as geography and history. Hans always answered every question correctly. Eventually, scientists and other leaders organized a special commission to investigate the “human horse.” They asked von Osten to leave the hall for their test. Then, they had Hans perform his usual math and language wizardry in front of a crowd. But the horse still did not miss an answer, tapping out correct responses to numerous questions from the commission’s leader. No one could stump the brainy Hans.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The public insisted that investigators form another commission. Members organized a second test in which the questioner whispered questions in Hans’s ear so no one else could hear. This time, Hans could not answer even a single question correctly. Instead of being brilliant, the horse was revealed as a dummkopf! Can you guess how the commission’s members proved Hans was a fraud? Von Osten had taught the horse to read the audience members’ “body-language signals.” As Hans tapped his hoof, people in the audience would exhibit clear signs of tension – straining forward, holding their breath – until the horse reached the correct number. Then they would all relax, at which point von Osten had taught Hans to stop tapping immediately. Hans was “clever” – but not because he was a math genius or geography expert. He simply knew how to take cues for his actions from the subtle responses of the people around him. “Know your audience” is one of the primary rules of effective communications. Hans, the horse, was able to learn this important lesson.

Let your shared interest come out gracefully during the conversation.</li>\n<li><strong>“Comm-YOU-nication”</strong> – Slip the word “you” into your discourse as often as possible. This focuses the content on the other person and gains his or her attention and approval.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid euphemisms</strong> – Always speak directly and to the point.

The right order is important: offer something first, then ask for what you want</li>\n<li>it’s possible to use this principle of reciprocity by doing favours for others, helping people, publicly praising others, and generally working in such a way as to build up a bank of social obligations owed to you. Each of these obligations will be settled at some point, probably to your advantage. Of course, if you’re too over the top with this type of behaviour, it will cease to work.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Authority</strong> We tend to follow the advice of experts. We have more Trust in a doctor who is wearing a white coat and displaying diplomas on their wall.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>building trust and credibility is very important, but it’s also possible to build some of that sense of authority through the recommendations and good words of others. It may be worth asking others to recommend you or recommending others so that they feel a social obligation to recommend you in return.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>consistency</strong> We look up to people who are consistent in their words and behaviours.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From a persuasion and influence perspective, this means that if I can convince you to act in a minor way in relation to something, then you’ll think of yourself as that type of person and be more likely to act in that way again in the future. You’ll also be more likely to increase your actions in that direction,</li>\n<li><em>put into action</em>: don’t follow every trend. Be the consistent one. People will remember you for that.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>consensus</strong> Humans are social by nature and generally feel that it’s important to conform to the norms of a social group. This means that when it comes to decision-making, we often look around us to see what others are doing before making our mind up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>put into action:</em> if you want someone to do something, show others doing it (“People who brought this book also brought…“)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>scarcity</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>we all want that which is rare, and we are all afraid to lose what we have</li>\n<li>put into action, it might not be enough to talk about the benefits of your offer.

They are usually scared of what they might lose; therefore, it’s good to tell them what they will lose if they fail to move</li>\n<li>The less of something there is, the more people tend to want it. This holds true for experiences as well as for material products.</li>\n<li>From a persuasion and influence perspective, this means that to increase interest in your product or service, you may benefit from reducing its availability (or at least creating a sense of scarcity).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>liking</strong> This is the most universal principle. People prefer to say yes to people they like, but who do we like?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>according to Sealdini, there are three factors\n<ul>\n<li>we like people who are similar to us</li>\n<li>we like people who compliment us</li>\n<li>we like people who cooperate with us towards a common goal</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>“Get in the habit of helping people out and don’t say no big deal says of course; it’s what partners do for each other’ - label what happened an act of partnership.”</li>\n<li>you simply need to become liked by those around you and those you are looking to persuade or influence. You can do this by cooperating with others, paying others genuine compliments, identifying similarities, and building relationships. The key here is that you need to build these relationships and garner this “liking” before you try to influence others. If you try to become like once you’ve started your efforts to influence, those efforts will fail.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"two-rules-of-meetings---why-meetings-take-so-long\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#two-rules-of-meetings---why-meetings-take-so-long\" aria-label=\"two rules of meetings   why meetings take so long permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Two rules of meetings - why meetings take so long</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>according to Seth Godin, there are only three kinds of meetings</p>\n<ul>\n<li>information: a meeting in which the participants are informed about something whether they like it or not</li>\n<li>discussion: a meeting which aims to give input or direction or to receive feedback</li>\n<li>permission for a meeting in which one side proposes something in the hope that the other says yes (but has the right and the power to say no)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>what often makes meetings frustrating is the fact that different people might think it’s a different kind of meeting</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>here are some tips to make meetings run more smoothly.

The meeting is over immediately</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the question rule: there are three types of questions that you can ask in a meeting</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>first comprehension questions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>second questions to support the process, for example, to make sure that everyone has really understood everything and is talking about the same thing and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>third questions that show how much you know in order to underscore your own position or challenge another person</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>all three types of questions are legitimate, but they should not be mixed: first come comprehension questions, then questions about the process, then debate questions</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The standing rule in many company meetings is held with everybody standing up because it leads to decisions being reached more quickly.

It is easy to hurt people with criticism, but false Compliments are also unhelpful. Harsh criticism damages our self-esteem and can lead us to make unwise choices, but flowery compliments often make us too complacent</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>as for the person giving the feedback, most people are prone to being critical as it gives them a feeling of superiority. They feel like they need to crush bad or weird ideas</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Feedback can be analyzed along two axes: negative or positive, constructive or destructive. So this gives us four different types of feedback</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“no” - negative, destructive feedback</strong> You are simply told the idea is bad without being given an explanation or offered an alternative. While this can be, at times, effective feedback that seldom changes the behaviour of the receiver</li>\n<li><strong>“No because…” - negative constructive feedback</strong> You are told you are wrong and presented with the correct answer. This is how Old School teaching works</li>\n<li><strong>“Yeah, but…” - positive destructive feedback</strong> Most managers have sooner or later heard about the importance of giving positive feedback, so they start off by saying something positive about your idea to deconstruct afterwards and offer a contrary opinion (“the idea is good, but…“)</li>\n<li>”<strong>yes and…” - the appreciative response</strong> tried to find the one thing in The Proposal that works and build on that\n<ul>\n<li>this goes back to appreciative inquiry, a method attributed to an American David Cooperider, that involves concentrating on the strengths, positive attributes, and potential of a company or a person rather than weaknesses.

To make sure people get an overwhelmingly positive impression when they first meet you, use the following tips:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Smile slowly</strong> – Don’t smile as soon as you meet someone. People will assume that you do this with everyone. Instead, wait a second or two, look long and deep at the person you are meeting, then smile big. This brief delay signals that you are not smiling because it is socially desirable, but because you see something special in this particular person that you really like.</li>\n<li><strong>“Sticky eyes”</strong> – Show people that you truly can’t take your eyes off of them. Maintain perfect eye contact while you speak with them.</li>\n<li><strong>“The big baby pivot”</strong> – When you meet someone, pivot directly toward him or her with a “total-body turn,” flash a genuine smile, and show the undivided and very special attention you would give to a young child who has just crawled up into your lap.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-know-what-to-say-after-you-say-hi\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-know-what-to-say-after-you-say-hi\" aria-label=\"how to know what to say after you say hi permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“How to Know What to Say After You Say, ‘Hi’”</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Many people, including senior executives, motivational speakers and great performers, hate to make small talk.

Once you have, ensure that your opening words “match that mood.” This is particularly important for salespeople.</li>\n<li><strong>“Wear a ‘whatzit’”</strong> – Starting a conversation with a stranger is not easy. One way to get the ball rolling is to wear something distinctive that he or she is sure to comment upon – a novel tie-tack, a piece of antique jewelry, or a special lapel pin or button.</li>\n<li><strong>The “swivelling spotlight”</strong> – People love to speak about themselves.

In many situations when you ask “how are you?” you expect a lie in response “thank you things are great”</li>\n<li><strong>black lie only the liar benefits</strong> although you are guilty you reject all accusations: “no I didn’t take the money” it is often also a bold promise a proactive lie if “I am elected I will never raise taxes…” Here bare-faced lying is used to your own advantage</li>\n<li><strong>red lie no one benefits</strong> saying something with complete awareness that the other person knows the statement to be false, even if you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>sometimes end up also inflicting damage on yourself the “largest audience ever to witness in inauguration”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>if you tell the truth you don’t have to remember anything - Mark Twain</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-six-word-rule---how-to-sum-up-a-whole-life-in-six-words\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-six-word-rule---how-to-sum-up-a-whole-life-in-six-words\" aria-label=\"the six word rule   how to sum up a whole life in six words permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>the six-word rule - how to sum up a whole life in six words</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hemmingway wrote novel in 6 words: “For sale, baby shoes, never worn”</li>\n<li>“Can you tell your life story in six words?”</li>\n<li>George Saunders summed life up beautifully: “started small, grew, peaked, shrunk, vanished”</li>\n<li>The six word rule is not a rejection of sprawling, convoluted sentences or endless digressions, but before writing (or speaking), you should ask yourself these questions: what do I really want to say and can I say it more succinctly?</li>\n<li><strong>if it’s important, keep it short</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"watzlawicks-axiom-theory---how-relationships-fail\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#watzlawicks-axiom-theory---how-relationships-fail\" aria-label=\"watzlawicks axiom theory   how relationships fail permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>watzlawick’s axiom theory - how relationships fail</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>an axiom is a valid truth that needs no proof</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>at the end of the 1960s the communication theorist Paul waslowick together with other researchers came up with five axioms to explain how interpersonal communication especially in relationships fails</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>you cannot not communicate a man</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>comes home, sits down, stares into space, and is silent, his wife looks at him and asks him how he is, he says nothing and yet he communicates something.

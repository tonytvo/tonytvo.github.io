Research indicates that “as many as 10,000 units of information flow per second” between individuals.</li>\n<li>Numerous proven techniques can increase your attractiveness and dynamism.</li>\n<li>People learn everything they need to know about you within the first few seconds of meeting you. Meanwhile, you are also forming powerful first impressions.</li>\n<li>You send clear signals about how you feel without saying a word.</li>\n<li>“Fine-tune your smile.”</li>\n<li>To make people feel great about you, focus your conversation on them.</li>\n<li>Many people are as frightened to make small talk as they appear on the stage.</li>\n<li>You will become a far more intelligent speaker if you simply find substitutes for a few “overworked words” such as “smart, nice, pretty or good.”</li>\n<li>we consistently overestimate our ability to judge strangers\n<ul>\n<li>with the smallest glimmer of information, we judge people we don’t know.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>we are incapable of spotting deception\n<ul>\n<li>we assume truthfulness until the evidence pointing toward deception is overwhelming.</li>\n<li>Generally, observers believe that most people are telling the truth. To tip from suspicion to disbelief, observers need an absolutely clear trigger. This could be clear agitation, total avoidance of eye contact or someone struggling to find words when directly accused of cheating. Without that trigger, our suspicions remain just that, and we assume truthfulness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Some people are better at spotting deception, but assuming the truth is important for society to function.\n<ul>\n<li>We can celebrate perceptive skepticism, but for most of us, it doesn’t matter that we can’t spot lies. Defaulting to truth makes sense, and Bernie Madoff and Ana Montes are outliers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Life isn’t like an episode of Friends – what you see on people’s faces doesn’t tell the whole story.\n<ul>\n<li>Transparency is the idea that someone’s demeanour reveals an authentic picture of their feelings. It’s one of the primary expectations we have when judging strangers. The problem is that transparency is often completely misleading.</li>\n<li>When strangers aren’t transparent, we easily and completely misjudge them.</li>\n<li>some people simply aren’t transparent. They’re mismatched, or their demeanour doesn’t reflect what they’re thinking.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alcohol can make interactions between strangers far worse, with terrible consequences\n<ul>\n<li>And a murky situation gets even murkier when alcohol is involved. The author believes that alcohol causes people to become myopic. Alcohol makes us disproportionately focus on short-term wants and forget about long-term consequences. Normally, we maintain a balance between the two.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are some ways we can get better, and the best way to start is to stop making assumptions</li>\n<li><strong>Humans are ill-equipped to understand strangers. We assume that people tell the truth, so we can’t detect lies. And we believe that we can judge strangers based on little, usually deceptive, information. The result of this misplaced confidence is that we don’t invest enough time and patience in truly listening to and understanding each other.</strong></li>\n<li>evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin believed that similar, easily interpreted expressions – of joy, sadness, fear, surprise, and the like – were consistent for all peoples and cultures. These things are not consistent at all, which explains why people can’t accurately gauge strangers’ emotions or intent across – or even within – cultures</li>\n<li><strong>Circumstances, Conditions and Context</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Gladwell affirms that you must face the additional problem of context beyond your inability to read strangers’ emotions and your powerful bias to believe what they tell you. Where and when you meet a stranger, he emphasizes, matters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"clever-hans-the-counting-horse\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#clever-hans-the-counting-horse\" aria-label=\"clever hans the counting horse permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“Clever Hans, the Counting Horse”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In Europe during the halcyon years before World War I, “Clever Hans, the counting horse,” was, without a doubt, the most talked-about sensation on the continent. A brilliant entertainer with a unique act, Hans could somehow supply accurate answers to math questions that audience members posed to him. He quickly tapped out the correct answers to any problem – addition, subtraction, multiplication and division – with a hoof. The horse’s owner, Herr von Osten, was always by his side while Hans performed these seemingly miraculous feats – but he never spoke to the horse or signalled him in any way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No one had ever seen such an amazing animal! Expanding beyond math, Hans “learned the alphabet.” By tapping his hoof several times for each letter, he would answer questions from audience members concerning the latest news or subjects such as geography and history. Hans always answered every question correctly. Eventually, scientists and other leaders organized a special commission to investigate the “human horse.” They asked von Osten to leave the hall for their test. Then, they had Hans perform his usual math and language wizardry in front of a crowd. But the horse still did not miss an answer, tapping out correct responses to numerous questions from the commission’s leader. No one could stump the brainy Hans.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The public insisted that investigators form another commission. Members organized a second test in which the questioner whispered questions in Hans’s ear so no one else could hear. This time, Hans could not answer even a single question correctly. Instead of being brilliant, the horse was revealed as a dummkopf! Can you guess how the commission’s members proved Hans was a fraud? Von Osten had taught the horse to read the audience members’ “body-language signals.” As Hans tapped his hoof, people in the audience would exhibit clear signs of tension – straining forward, holding their breath – until the horse reached the correct number. Then they would all relax, at which point von Osten had taught Hans to stop tapping immediately. Hans was “clever” – but not because he was a math genius or geography expert. He simply knew how to take cues for his actions from the subtle responses of the people around him. “Know your audience” is one of the primary rules of effective communications. Hans, the horse, was able to learn this important lesson.

To make sure people get an overwhelmingly positive impression when they first meet you, use the following tips:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Smile slowly</strong> – Don’t smile as soon as you meet someone. People will assume that you do this with everyone. Instead, wait a second or two, look long and deep at the person you are meeting, then smile big. This brief delay signals that you are not smiling because it is socially desirable, but because you see something special in this particular person that you really like.</li>\n<li><strong>“Sticky eyes”</strong> – Show people that you truly can’t take your eyes off of them. Maintain perfect eye contact while you speak with them.</li>\n<li><strong>“The big baby pivot”</strong> – When you meet someone, pivot directly toward him or her with a “total-body turn,” flash a genuine smile, and show the undivided and very special attention you would give to a young child who has just crawled up into your lap.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-know-what-to-say-after-you-say-hi\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-know-what-to-say-after-you-say-hi\" aria-label=\"how to know what to say after you say hi permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“How to Know What to Say After You Say, ‘Hi’”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Many people, including senior executives, motivational speakers and great performers, hate to make small talk. But it is an art that you can easily muster if you follow these tactics:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The “mood match”</strong> – Don’t speak with someone else until you first sample his or her mood. Once you have, ensure that your opening words “match that mood.” This is particularly important for salespeople.</li>\n<li><strong>“Wear a ‘whatzit’”</strong> – Starting a conversation with a stranger is not easy. One way to get the ball rolling is to wear something distinctive that he or she is sure to comment upon – a novel tie-tack, a piece of antique jewelry, or a special lapel pin or button.</li>\n<li><strong>The “swivelling spotlight”</strong> – People love to speak about themselves. Imagine a giant spotlight that rotates to light up your counterpart. Keep the spotlight – and focus – on that person and not yourself.

Let your shared interest come out gracefully during the conversation.</li>\n<li><strong>“Comm-YOU-nication”</strong> – Slip the word “you” into your discourse as often as possible. This focuses the content on the other person and gains his or her attention and approval.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid euphemisms</strong> – Always speak directly and to the point.

Pick up the lingo by listening to others to find out what their special words and phrases mean so you can use them appropriately.</li>\n<li><strong>Hit their “hot buttons”</strong> – Each professional group has provocative issues – for example, doctors get feisty about their relationships with hospitals.

Research indicates that “as many as 10,000 units of information flow per second” between individuals.</li>\n<li>Numerous proven techniques can increase your attractiveness and dynamism.</li>\n<li>People learn everything they need to know about you within the first few seconds of meeting you. Meanwhile, you are also forming powerful first impressions.</li>\n<li>You send clear signals about how you feel without saying a word.</li>\n<li>“Fine-tune your smile.”</li>\n<li>To make people feel great about you, focus your conversation on them.</li>\n<li>Many people are as frightened to make small talk as they appear on the stage.</li>\n<li>You will become a far more intelligent speaker if you simply find substitutes for a few “overworked words” such as “smart, nice, pretty or good.”</li>\n<li>we consistently overestimate our ability to judge strangers\n<ul>\n<li>with the smallest glimmer of information, we judge people we don’t know.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>we are incapable of spotting deception\n<ul>\n<li>we assume truthfulness until the evidence pointing toward deception is overwhelming.</li>\n<li>Generally, observers believe that most people are telling the truth. To tip from suspicion to disbelief, observers need an absolutely clear trigger. This could be clear agitation, total avoidance of eye contact or someone struggling to find words when directly accused of cheating. Without that trigger, our suspicions remain just that, and we assume truthfulness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Some people are better at spotting deception, but assuming the truth is important for society to function.\n<ul>\n<li>We can celebrate perceptive skepticism, but for most of us, it doesn’t matter that we can’t spot lies. Defaulting to truth makes sense, and Bernie Madoff and Ana Montes are outliers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Life isn’t like an episode of Friends – what you see on people’s faces doesn’t tell the whole story.\n<ul>\n<li>Transparency is the idea that someone’s demeanour reveals an authentic picture of their feelings. It’s one of the primary expectations we have when judging strangers. The problem is that transparency is often completely misleading.</li>\n<li>When strangers aren’t transparent, we easily and completely misjudge them.</li>\n<li>some people simply aren’t transparent. They’re mismatched, or their demeanour doesn’t reflect what they’re thinking.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alcohol can make interactions between strangers far worse, with terrible consequences\n<ul>\n<li>And a murky situation gets even murkier when alcohol is involved. The author believes that alcohol causes people to become myopic. Alcohol makes us disproportionately focus on short-term wants and forget about long-term consequences. Normally, we maintain a balance between the two.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are some ways we can get better, and the best way to start is to stop making assumptions</li>\n<li><strong>Humans are ill-equipped to understand strangers. We assume that people tell the truth, so we can’t detect lies. And we believe that we can judge strangers based on little, usually deceptive, information. The result of this misplaced confidence is that we don’t invest enough time and patience in truly listening to and understanding each other.</strong></li>\n<li>evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin believed that similar, easily interpreted expressions – of joy, sadness, fear, surprise, and the like – were consistent for all peoples and cultures. These things are not consistent at all, which explains why people can’t accurately gauge strangers’ emotions or intent across – or even within – cultures</li>\n<li><strong>Circumstances, Conditions and Context</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Gladwell affirms that you must face the additional problem of context beyond your inability to read strangers’ emotions and your powerful bias to believe what they tell you. Where and when you meet a stranger, he emphasizes, matters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"clever-hans-the-counting-horse\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#clever-hans-the-counting-horse\" aria-label=\"clever hans the counting horse permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“Clever Hans, the Counting Horse”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In Europe during the halcyon years before World War I, “Clever Hans, the counting horse,” was, without a doubt, the most talked-about sensation on the continent. A brilliant entertainer with a unique act, Hans could somehow supply accurate answers to math questions that audience members posed to him. He quickly tapped out the correct answers to any problem – addition, subtraction, multiplication and division – with a hoof. The horse’s owner, Herr von Osten, was always by his side while Hans performed these seemingly miraculous feats – but he never spoke to the horse or signalled him in any way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No one had ever seen such an amazing animal! Expanding beyond math, Hans “learned the alphabet.” By tapping his hoof several times for each letter, he would answer questions from audience members concerning the latest news or subjects such as geography and history. Hans always answered every question correctly. Eventually, scientists and other leaders organized a special commission to investigate the “human horse.” They asked von Osten to leave the hall for their test. Then, they had Hans perform his usual math and language wizardry in front of a crowd. But the horse still did not miss an answer, tapping out correct responses to numerous questions from the commission’s leader. No one could stump the brainy Hans.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The public insisted that investigators form another commission. Members organized a second test in which the questioner whispered questions in Hans’s ear so no one else could hear. This time, Hans could not answer even a single question correctly. Instead of being brilliant, the horse was revealed as a dummkopf! Can you guess how the commission’s members proved Hans was a fraud? Von Osten had taught the horse to read the audience members’ “body-language signals.” As Hans tapped his hoof, people in the audience would exhibit clear signs of tension – straining forward, holding their breath – until the horse reached the correct number. Then they would all relax, at which point von Osten had taught Hans to stop tapping immediately. Hans was “clever” – but not because he was a math genius or geography expert. He simply knew how to take cues for his actions from the subtle responses of the people around him. “Know your audience” is one of the primary rules of effective communications. Hans, the horse, was able to learn this important lesson.

They have confidence, choose the proper words, and don’t use clichés. Follow their lead:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“Kill the quick ‘me too!‘”</strong> – To impress, avoid immediately matching someone else’s account of a personal experience or preference – say, a love of sailing – with your own story. Let your shared interest come out gracefully during the conversation.</li>\n<li><strong>“Comm-YOU-nication”</strong> – Slip the word “you” into your discourse as often as possible. This focuses the content on the other person and gains his or her attention and approval.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid euphemisms</strong> – Always speak directly and to the point.

If you try and become liked once you’ve started your efforts to influence, then those efforts will fail.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"two-rules-of-meetings-why-meetings-take-so-long\"

Godin there are only three kinds of meetings</p>\n<ul>\n<li>information a meeting in which the participants are informed about something whether they like it or not</li>\n<li>discussion a meeting which aims to give input or direction or to receive feedback</li>\n<li>permission a meeting in which one side proposes something in the hope that the other says yes (but has the right and the power to say no)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>what often makes meetings frustrating is the fact that different people might think it’s a different kind of meeting</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>here are some tips to make meetings run more smoothly the 15-minute rule</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parkinson’s law states that <em>work expands so as to fill the time available for it’s completion</em> and not according to how complex it really is there for it makes sense to limit the time of meetings incidentally studies show that the attention span of the average person is between 10 and 18 minutes ideally you should use a timer when it rings the meeting is over immediately</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the question rule there are three types of question that you can ask in a meeting</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>first comprehension questions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>second questions to support the process for example to make sure that everyone has really understood everything and is talking about the same thing and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>third questions that show how much you know in order to underscore your own position or challenge another person</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>all three types of question are legitimate but they should not be mixed, first come comprehension questions, then questions about the process then debate questions</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the standing rule in many companies meetings are held with everybody standing up because it leads to decisions being reached more quickly, Washington University studies showed that when they are standing people react more readily with enthusiasm whereas when they are sitting they tend towards skepticism</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>smartphone rule: no smartphones during the meeting</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>notes should be made by hand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if you want to call a family meeting just turn off the Wi-Fi router and wait in the room where it is located</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"boss-talk-how-to-talk-to-your-team\"

They worked hard to learn how to speak effectively, be appealing, and charm and persuade others. How did they achieve their goals? The answer is simple: They each applied certain remarkably helpful rules of personal communication and, thus, developed themselves into winning and attractive personalities. Yes, such rules exist. Furthermore, they are easy to learn and employ.

To make sure people get an overwhelmingly positive impression when they first meet you, use the following tips:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Smile slowly</strong> – Don’t smile as soon as you meet someone. People will assume that you do this with everyone. Instead, wait a second or two, look long and deep at the person you are meeting, then smile big. This brief delay signals that you are not smiling because it is socially desirable, but because you see something special in this particular person that you really like.</li>\n<li><strong>“Sticky eyes”</strong> – Show people that you truly can’t take your eyes off of them. Maintain perfect eye contact while you speak with them.</li>\n<li><strong>“The big baby pivot”</strong> – When you meet someone, pivot directly toward him or her with a “total-body turn,” flash a genuine smile, and show the undivided and very special attention you would give to a young child who has just crawled up into your lap.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-know-what-to-say-after-you-say-hi\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-know-what-to-say-after-you-say-hi\" aria-label=\"how to know what to say after you say hi permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>“How to Know What to Say After You Say, ‘Hi’”</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Many people, including senior executives, motivational speakers and great performers, hate to make small talk.

Once you have, ensure that your opening words “match that mood.” This is particularly important for salespeople.</li>\n<li><strong>“Wear a ‘whatzit’”</strong> – Starting a conversation with a stranger is not easy.

premise that it’s not what you say but how you say it he distinguishes between\nspeaking snappishly language of the Jackal and speaking from the heart language of the giraffe\ngiraffes have the biggest heart of any land animal this may sound like mumbo jumbo but it\ncomes closer to reality then most management jargon the language of the Jackal causes the\nspeaker to feel Superior and the person being addressed to feel bad typical examples of Jackal language\nanalysis that’s wrong because criticism the mistake you made was that\nyou interpretations you do that because appraisals your smart slash lazy you’re\nright slash wrong threats if you don’t do it immediately I’ll have to\naccording to Rosenberg statements like these are desires and disguise because we have not learned to ask for\nsomething politely or to express our wishes constructively we resort to aggressive language\nand aggression leads to counter-aggression or submissive subjugation giraffe language on the other hand works\nlike this observe without evaluating you always look out of the window when I want to\ntalk to you acknowledge and Define your own or others feelings I’m worried\nacknowledge needs and take them seriously I want to know how you are doing\nExpress clear and achievable objectives based on these needs please tell me what you need so that we can talk\nabout it but why is it so difficult to be friendly often we ourselves are the problem\ntake the so-called attribution error if we arrive late there was a lot of traffic\nif others arrive late they set off too late or for people with a negative frame of mind the other way\nround we are by Nature prone to pass judgment and what’s more it is\neasier to blame someone else than to think about why something happened the essence of normal communication we\nall like to be right the essence of non-violent communication we are\nbetter off if we resolve a dispute then if we win it or in the words of Marshall Rosenberg\nwould you rather be

in order to be understood</h2>\n<p>people’s three biggest fears loving\nsomeone without being loved in return searching for friends and not finding any saying something and not being\nunderstood there is no solution to the first two for the third there is at\nleast the principle the British philosopher Paul Grice 1913-88 dedicated his life to this\nproblem and in 1975 finally formulated the so-called Cooperative principle a\nbasic rule for effective communication make your conversational contributions\nsuch as is required at the stage at which it occurs by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk\nExchange in which you are engaged you might be thinking that Grace could have done with\nsome language training himself but let’s take a closer look at what the cooperative\nprinciple is actually all about according to Grice speaker and listener\nwant two and have to behave cooperatively this means that one person wants to be\nunderstood the other to understand in order for this to work Grace proposed for conversational maxims\none maxim of quantity say enough for your counterpart to understand but don’t\nsay too much or you will cause confusion two maximum quality tell the truth don’t\nspeculate don’t dupe the person into believing something different three maximum of relevance don’t say\nanything irrelevant don’t change the subject for maximum of manner avoid ambiguity\nvagueness verbosity and volatility and stick to a logical argument\nif we follow these maxims then as a general rule we will be understood\nbut what happens if we don’t follow them which is the case in most of our conversations\nwe can violate the maxims without being noticed that’s called lying did you\nwreck the car no I didn’t although you did we can violate the maxims\ndeliberately by saying something else but Expecting The Listener to understand the message correctly\nthat’s called flouting a typical form is irony you\nlook out of the window to see the storm intensify you then turn to your friend and say\nwhat wonderful weather we can refrain from cooperation\nthat’s called opting out if you say my lips are sealed this implies you know\nsomething but won’t talk about it and this will end all communication\nonly say what is true and important and express it clearly and simply</p>\n<h2

comes in looks around walks past\nthe empty seats and sits down right next to you the feeling that you now have is\ncalled expectancy violation you expected something different that the person would find an empty seat not\none right next to you in 1985 the American Judy burgoon\ndeveloped the expectancy violations Theory which analyzes how our expectations of\nanother person affect the way we respond to unanticipated violations of these expectations or social norms\naccording to burgoon the following rules apply in the Western World with regard to keeping our distance\none intimate space Elbow Room up to 50 centimeters within this space we expect\nto be touched by the other person it is reserved for close family lovers\nand pets 2. personal space 50 to 120\ncentimeters the typical distance we keep from somebody we are talking to\nthree social space 120 to 360 centimeters\nthe distance we keep from people we do not know with whom we do not communicate but\nwhom we have nothing against four public space 360 centimeters or\nmore this distance is best explained if we ask ourselves which people do we avoid\nof course it is not only about distance but also about physical and I contact\nif someone turns away from us while we are speaking it violates our expectations of the conversation\nthis is most easily observed in romantic relationships where the usage\nof smartphones and social media is for many a strong sign of divided attention and a source for trouble\nthe distance we keep is also influenced by cultural and situational norms\ndifferent distance rules apply to dancing in a club and studying in a Library\nin Switzerland people greet one another with three little kisses in the USA this would be regarded as too\nclose for comfort When in Rome do as the Romans

the logic of this period was\nthe clever side never gives an end comes out on top to when you have to take action not\nnegotiate Europe was in Ruins by the time the game was over\nduring this period John Von Neumann a mathematician an Oscar Morgenstern an economist developed their\nfamous game theory this Theory examines conflicts in which the result for all participants depends on\ndecisions made by others as in negotiations game theory is based on the observation\nthat people in conflicts behave in the same way as they would when playing a board game they want to win but do so by\nsticking to the rules of the game otherwise it won’t work how do you win\nbut still follow the rules the solution by approaching and talking\nto each other or in the words of game theorists by cooperating\nlet’s take a simple example at some point most adults decide not to give\neach other Christmas presents anymore the pressure to consume is annoying and in any case what do you\ngive a person who has everything but typically some people still do buy a present even if they agreed not to\nthe person who gets the gift but didn’t give one in return now has a bad conscience the person who gave but\ndidn’t receive is disappointed the results conflict there are only two logical Solutions and\nboth have to do with communication you have to decide whether a everyone or B nobody\ngets a gift but this super simple Game Theory solution can only be\nachieved if both sides go along with the plan and if they make a binding agreement to stick to it two complex\nactions that people find

communication problems the psychiatrist Eric Byrne\n1910-70 however believed that you do not have to go on a painful journey into\nyour past to get to know yourself it is enough to observe yourself in communication with others in 1964 Byrne\nproposed in his book games people play a counter model to Freud’s theory a book which due to its\nSimplicity and Clarity became a bestseller in the genre of communication and self-help books\naccording to burn it all starts with the three ego States we adopt in relation to others</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the parent-ego state we all are a little like our parents this is evident</li>\n</ol>\n<p>when we patronize others or tell them what they should or should not do but also when we act thoughtfully\nempathically or helpfully 2. the adult ego State we act like\nadults when we communicate in a considered controlled and relaxed way\nin other words when we treat the other party respectfully and respond to criticism factually and\nconstructively three the child ego State we also carry and ask the child that we once were\nwe are unrepentant defiant silly or anxious but positive qualities such as\nimagination curiosity and learning are also evident in our childlike\ncommunication all states occur in one person so what uses transactional analysis in\npractice when we communicate it is always from one of these ego States\nwe are not always aware of this but it is most evident when we observe ourselves\nlet’s suppose that a proposal we put forward in a discussion is rejected by the group\nif we react in an offended way or respond defiantly we are in child mode if we weigh things\nup rationally and realize that our proposal was no good we are in the adult mode\nbut if we argue morally that the others are wrong because we are right we are in

is a fundamental rule how something is set in by whom the narrative context or frame\ndetermines how something is understood to take one example if a sensational\npiece of news is printed in a reputable newspaper we are more inclined to\nbelieve it than if it is reported in a tabloid this observation was made by Irving Goffman who described\nthis form of interpretation as framing if we look at a picture in the museum we know\nthat it is Art even if it looks like a stick figure drawn by a child this is because we have learned to\nrecognize the frame Modern Art another example if we go to a restaurant we know\nhow to behave how to interact with the waiter how to handle a knife in\nfork and what to do with it menu we know this because we know the frame\nrestaurant in his seminal work the Presentation of Self in Everyday Life Goffman uses the\nimagery of theater and acting to describe human social interaction he believes that we each adapt our\nBehavior to each frame and are therefore a different person in each situation\nthis means that there is no such thing as authenticity we are one person when we are at work\nanother when we talk to our parents and quite another when we are lost in a foreign city and have\nto communicate with strangers Daniel Kahneman and Amos firsky famously\nshowed how different ways of phrasing frame a dilemma and affect people’s responses to a\nchoice this logic is used to great effect in advertising for example two\nyogurts are on sale one is 90 fat free and the other is touted as having\na ten percent fat content although both contain equal quantities of fat people\ntend to choose the yogurt advertised is almost fat-free because the frame for the yogurt purports that it is\na fat free healthier product the bottom line is we seldom make rational\nchoices there are no objective or authentic messages everything that is being\ncommunicated is always framed and if you want to decode a message try\nto understand the frame</p>\n<h2

medium is the message</h2>\n<p>the Canadian media scholar Marshall mcluhan\n1911-80 who generally shunned the Limelight became the world’s most talked about intellectual in\n1967 this was because he had summed up the media Revolution the transition from\nprint to TV in a single sentence the medium is the message\nthe sentence is not as simple as it first appears what does it mean it does not mean what\nyou might initially think I that the medium has become more important than its message\na hint mcluhan’s theories never focus on the obvious clear-cut or logical\nrather the sentence means that the medium is not important because of its message but because it can\nchange our Behavior our thinking and our lives and what does that mean if we use\nthe word medium we are usually only referring to the channel via which information is transmitted mcluhan\nbelieved that this channel is more formative for our culture than the message it carries\nIf the message changes we simply change our minds but when the medium changes we change\nour Behavior this sounded crazy in the 1960s but since the Advent of social media and\nsince we have started to reflect on the ways in which mobile devices dominate our everyday lives it makes much more\nsense suddenly his meaning is Crystal Clear it’s not what we read on our\nsmartphone that changes our Behavior but that we are reading it on our smartphone\nwhat makes our smartphone so fascinating that we stroke it more than our newborn\nchild see the uses and gratifications Theory Dot we shape our tools and the\ntools shape us wrote mcluhan he also wrote people don’t really read\nnewspapers they just climb into them every morning like into a hot bath\nwas there ever a better description for the internet in his time McLean was taken more\nseriously by hippies then academics this was a double misunderstanding\nbecause as a conservative Catholic he was opposed to the media developments he\ndescribed the news doesn’t change us the medium does take a minute and make a\nlist the five things that have changed in your behavior since using a smartphone\nnow ask yourself what changes do you regret and finally what would it take to undo them</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fomo-phenomenon---what-happens-if-you-dont-look-at-your-smartphone\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

if you want to analyze fake news a good starting point is the lighthearted model\ndeveloped by the American sociologist Harold D Laswell in 1948 which still works astonishingly\nwell today for example to separate fakes from facts the formula is who says what in which\nchannel to whom with what effect who by answering who said it we divert\nour attention to the sender Laswell called this control analysis who is talking what is their aim who are their\nallies what by looking at what is being said we give attention to the actual message the\ncontent analysis to identify the aim behind the message we can for example\nask how are women or people of color represented what does the phrasing imply\nwhich by answering the which channel question we make a media analysis why are they using this channel\nhow can they afford it who paid for it to whom the audience analysis can for\nexample reveal something about the aim of the sender why are they talking specifically to these\npeople with what effect with the effect analysis we ask how did the audience\nreact what does this tell us about the sender Laswell was concerned with the effects\nof mass media but his message also applies to interpersonal\ncommunication his formula is a simple way to sharpen your senses for propaganda\nwherever it’s coming from</p>\n<h2

of the greatest communication theorists Stuart Hall 1932-2014\nwas of the same opinion in fact he took the idea further he\nbelieved not only that we are capable of misunderstanding but that we play inactive\nrole in understanding peresi we interpret or decode the same message\ndifferently depending on our social class our level of knowledge and our\ncultural background but above all the way we understand a message also\ndepends on how we want to understand it an example is the cult 1960s TV\nseries Star Trek many fans interpreted the series as a classic science fiction\nAdventure in Space but the gay community saw the close-knit relationships\nbetween the men and the rainbow crew black African Asian Russian\nVulcan as an allusion to the fact that some of the characters were gay it is\nirrelevant that Star Trek’s Creator Jean Roddenberry denied this because according to Stuart Hall the message can\nbe changed once it has been received in other words Star Trek fans\nsaw in the series what they wanted to see the encoding slash decoding model\ncontradicts the classic sender receiver model According to which the recipient\nplays a passive role Paul argued that the way we receive a message is inactive\nand never clear-cut process so that the message can always be understood differently the sender\nencodes the message with a particular intention the receiver decodes the\nmessage in order to understand it and this decoding can happen in three\ndifferent ways 1. dominant hegemonic the desired reading we understand the\nmessage the way it was intended 2. oppositional we oppose or dismiss the intended\nmeaning three negotiated a combination of the two a message is more than just what is said\nit changes depending on how it is understood let’s put this into practice if you are\na leader always make your team repeat to you how they have understood your message\nthat is by the way the reason why co-pilots Always repeat what they just heard the pilot

which claims that people who watch a lot\nof Television are more likely to cultivate the belief that reality corresponds with what they are seeing on\nTV he argued that watching a lot of Television changes our perception of\nreality and causes anxiety the mass media in the Past film and TV\nnowadays mostly games and the internet confronts us with an exaggerated stylized world\naccording to gerbner those who consume a lot of media start to see the real world\nin the way it is stylized on screen some examples in everyday life we rarely\nsee a policeman with a drawn gun in a crime drama however it is\nstandard in reality we rarely see violence on screen we see it all the\ntime according to gerbner if we consume these kinds of on-screen images over\na long period of time our perception of reality changes and we begin to\ninternalize it even if we don’t actually see any violence we start to believe\nthe world is a violent place and the more violent and frightening images\nwe see the more anxious we become in our everyday lives so the media influences us\nbut to what extent does it mean for example that excessively playing FPS\nfirst-person shooter games will cause the player to go on a killing spree\nno the media does not form r opinions and beliefs but it does\nreinforce them so somebody who already has violent fantasies will find\naffirmation for them online but somebody who coexists peacefully with others will\nnot turn into a serial killer by watching violent films several nights in a row it is important to remember that\nwe prefer to watch things we enjoy as is demonstrated most clearly by the\nfilter bubble effect on the internet algorithms try to predict what information we will be looking for based\non our interests and opinions that way there is little chance of being\nconvinced by a different opinion because we are unlikely to be served any alternative views\nwhen it comes to decision making this kind of self-confirming information proves a huge risk as explained in the\nchapter on groupthink the cultivation theory has been criticized for its lack of\ncomplexity viewers are regarded as passive and easy to manipulate if you are\ninterested in the opposite view take a look at the encoding slash decoding model\nif you like apples and spend hours watching a TV program about pairs you won’t suddenly prefer pairs\nafterwards but if you already like pears and spend hours watching a program about\npairs you will like pears even more afterwards</p>\n<h2

standpoint Theory what opinion has to do with power</h2>\n<p>everyone has a voice but not everyone is heard\nthe voices that Prevail are called hegemonic the creation of hegemony has little to do with\ndemocracy and everything to do with power it is not a question of who has\nsomething legitimate or important to say but always of who has sufficient resources and influence in a society to\nDefine their opinion as legitimate or important the hegemonic perspective is considered\nneutral anything that deviates from it is seen as an exception and ascribed to others\nthe hegemonic view claims not to represent a specific point of view position or\nlife experience but rather to represent things as simply the way they are an example the media in the western\nworld is dominated by white male journalists nevertheless the news never announces\ntoday you will hear the news from a white male perspective white and male are not\nexplicitly named they are regarded as general neutral and non-specific\nanother example if a married couple are heterosexual they’re sexual orientation isn’t mentioned if they are\nhomosexual it is the question of hegemonic voices is associated with the concept of which\ntruths prevail here we come to the standpoint Theory who’s most important proponents are Donna haraway\nand Sandra Harding they maintain that a voice or standpoint cannot be objective\nor neutral or exist outside a specific social context\nhere is an example in science and in children’s books to the present day the\nidea that prehistoric people hunted mammoths was long considered to be fact\nprehistoric people or more concretely prehistoric Men set off\non dangerous Mammoth hunting expeditions but in fact this image was created in\nthe 19th century at a time when hunting was no longer essential for survival but\nwas simply a status symbol in their interpretations of prehistory archaeologists\nneglected unspectacular types of food procurements such as Gathering berries and roots or trapping small animals\nthis is not to say that men did not sometimes slay a mammoth but it distorts the fact that they\nmainly collected berries here the historians were not objective\nbut confirmed The Stereotype of men as Brave Fighters Warriors and family Breadwinners as if\nthis were a law of nature bottom line if you believe that you hold an objective\nopinion ask yourself what other points of view were excluded so that yours could prevail\nif you want to make sure that every voice in the room is heard you can ask your team not to express their opinion\nabout a given topic but rather brainstorm different possible opinions\nthat way sooner or later even though unheard voices will appear on the flip chart and once they are up there they\ncan be discussed

and Rule what we remember from a conversation</h2>\n<p>here’s a question how do we know if a presentation a job interview or a\ndate went well we usually have a good hunch but do we really know\nassessing a date would involve some pretty complicated number crunching we’d have to\ncalculate how we felt how the other person felt what we had expected and\nso on an impossible task it turns out our mind solves this problem by using a\nsurprisingly simple strategy as Lori Santos from Yale University explains brilliantly in a\nlecture when we remember something we ignore most of it actually we\nmake an assessment based only on two parts of the experience 1. the peak I.E the part of the\nexperience that was most extreme either Pleasant or unpleasant two the end I.E whether it got better or\nworse at the end this is important even a small Improvement can\nmake the date seem like an okay experience whereas a poor ending will ruin an otherwise great evening this is\nthe peak and Rule devised in a 1993 study by the Nobel Laureate Daniel\nKahneman and his colleagues how can we use this in our life the peak and Rule gives us some hints\nabout how to make an experience special we often obsess about what kind of first\nimpression we make on people fearing that people might judge us based only on our outward appearance or\nfirst sentences this thinking is based on the famous notion of you only\nhave one chance to make a first impression though this holds true the\nfirst thing we hear about someone influences our Judgment of that person the first price we are quoted forms the\nbasis for the negotiation it is the anchor effect maybe we should start\nobsessing about something else there might be only one chance to make a lasting impression that lasting\nimpression is not necessarily the first impression but rather the last one\nthat is by the way the reason why we binge watch TV shows by ending\non a cliffhanger they have perfected the peak and Rule so when it comes to communication it is\nof course important how we start a meeting how we set the tone how we break the ice\nbut according to kahneman’s work maybe we should start focusing on how we want\nto end the whole damn thing I don’t care about opening sentences\nall I care about is the last sentence it’s the sentence the reader will go to bed with</p>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

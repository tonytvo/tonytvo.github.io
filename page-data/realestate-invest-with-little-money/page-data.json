These have been passed down from one established investor to another with the goal of keeping aspiring investors from crashing and burning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When investing creatively, you need to find even better deals than those who invest normally. Let me explain what I mean. Let’s say a certain home is worth $100,000. A traditional investor might pay $100,000 for that home, put a 30% down payment ($30,000) on the property, and make a nice return on investment from the cash flow (the extra money left after all the expenses are paid).However, if I were to purchase that same house for $60,000 because I took the extra steps necessary to get a great deal, which of us is in the better position? The traditional investor, who has $30,000 of their cash tied up in their property and no real equity, or me, who has nothing invested but owes less?Because of the deal I obtained, I have far greater potential for profit and for a better return on investment than the normal investor, but less of my cash is at risk because I have no cash invested at all.However, what if I decided to be just a “normal” investor and pay full price for that $100,000 property, with no money down? Most likely, my mortgage payment would be so high that good cash flow would be out of reach, and I would not have the equity necessary to be able to sell the property. In this case, the “good” investor would be in a better position because they owed only $70,000. Hopefully, you are following my argument here… creative investing means you must invest in incredible deals, or it’s simply not worth doing</li>\n<li>When investing creatively, you must be extremely conservative. I’m not talking politics here; I’m talking about planning for the future. This means assuming the worst when buying property. Take as a given that taxes will go up, your unit will sit vacant for a certain percentage of each year (higher than the average for your area), repairs will be numerous and expensive, and you will need to evict deadbeat tenants. Plan for these costs and only buy property that proves to still be a good deal even after a conservative estimate</li>\n<li>Creative finance requires sacrifice. Remember my definition of creative finance: the ability to trade cash for creativity. Notice there is a trade-off involved—one you need to accept. Most of the methods I’ve used to acquire real estate, I didn’t learn from a book. Instead, I discovered the methods at 4:00 a.m. after an eight-hour brainstorming session with my wife, my pen, and my paper, desperately trying to figure out the missing puzzle piece that would enable me to close a deal. This is often the trade. It requires jumping through a lot of mental hoops, numerous conversations with others, and the ability to ask for help. Creative real estate investing is a puzzle that takes real mental (and sometimes physical) effort to put together. If you want easy, then stick with a job, a sizable down payment, and average returns. There is nothing wrong with that, and I’d have chosen the same if I’d had enough money and income when I started. But I didn’t, so I chose creativity. I chose to sacrifice. Will you?</li>\n<li>Creative finance does not mean investing without a cushion. A wise man and mentor once told me, “You can go broke buying good deals.” Even though you need to get killer good deals if you are going to invest with no or little money down, you still need to understand that bad stuff happens. Murphy will show up on your doorstep and start knocking. He might even move his whole family in. Therefore, maintaining a financial cushion to deal with problems is imperative. You don’t need $50,000 in the bank to buy a small rental house, but you do need to be able to weather the storms that will come, relative to the size of the property you are buying and that property’s risk for loss.For example, if you needed to evict a tenant, could you handle several months of lost rent, more than $2,000 in eviction costs, and several thousands of dollars to repair the property? What if you had to do this twice in the same year? These are important questions you must be able to answer, or at least discuss. These questions do have answers, so hang in there and keep your brain turning.I can’t tell you exactly how much money you’ll need to save, because that depends largely on a number of factors, including the following:The strength of your target real estate marketYour ability to manage effectivelyYou ability and desire to repair things yourself, if neededHow difficult and lengthy evictions are in your state. How good your credit is. How much cash flow you can getThe average purchase price of your target propertiesThe niche you enterThe strategy you useAnd a whole lot more</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The point is, be conservative, buy great deals, and have a financial backup plan. If this means spending six months working a second job to save up $5,000 to put into a savings account, then start that second job tomorrow. Maybe it means asking your boss for a raise or lowering your living expenses (remember… sacrifice!). Whatever you need to do, get started as soon as possible. Stop wasting time on excuses and start planning for how you are going to get there</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"owner-occupied-investment-properties\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#owner-occupied-investment-properties\" aria-label=\"owner occupied investment properties permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>owner occupied investment properties</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>an owner-occupied investment property is a home that has been purchased as an investment but that also functions as a primary residence for the investor.

Because America loves homeowners, investing in real estate that doubles as a home satisfies the country’s love of home-ownership.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Many people treat their homes as if they were investments, when in reality, they are massive  liabilities that deplete your finances. You can consider a single-family home as an investment if you purchase it with the intention of using it as a real estate investment in the future or if you can build substantial equity by doing some light rehab and then parlay that equity into greater investments later.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another form of real estate investment that can be done by an individual is the small multifamily home. Multifamily homes can be bought and rehabbed to rent out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>small multifamily properties, such as duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes, are eligible for the  same American benefits as single-family homes. That is, they are low cost, easy to obtain financing for, and offer the potential to generate a constant monthly income.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The decision as to which type of property to buy comes down to your lifestyle: whether you have a large family or not. If you do, you may want to go for a multifamily property.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are low money down lending opportunities that exist for homeowners that simply do not  exist for the typical real estate investor. By taking advantage of these opportunities, you can start building your rental portfolio with very little out-of-pocket cash and get started sooner than you may have imagined.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a federal agency under the Department of</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures loans made by banks. Before the late 2007 real estate market crash, FHA loans were rarely used because almost anyone could qualify for a mortgage with little or no money down.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a federal agency created in 1934 to help with the shortage of housing following the Great Depression. The FHA provides low interest loans to qualified buyers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The FHA loan is a government-backed loan that allows you to purchase property. However, it also has its share of problems, such as the Mortgage Insurance Premium that can really add up and the fact that you can have only one FHA loan at a time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a government agency that insures loans provided by banks and other financial institutions. FHA loans are not insured by the government as much as conventional loans, but they are still insured.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The FHA loan is another government insured loan that allows the borrower to borrow money to buy a home. The 203k loan is a subset of the FHA program and allows the borrower to borrow money to pay for cosmetic repairs such as paint and carpet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The biggest difference between a regular 203k loan and a streamlined one is the extent of the rehab. The streamlined one can be used for smaller cosmetic problems, like painting, carpet, and smells, whereas the regular one can be used for structural changes, like moving walls or building additions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The biggest disadvantage of the 203k loan is that it entails even more red tape than the regular FHA loan, and rehabs are riskier since they are subject to the MIP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The 203k loan is a great tool for first-time investors who purchase fixer-upper houses. The key is to use it correctly, which requires finding a property with basic cosmetic issues that can be acquired for far below value and with the potential for quick appreciation after purchase.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides financing for veterans and their families. Like the Federal Housing Administration, the VA offers insured loans that protect a portion of the lender’s investment in case of default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers one that works very similarly to the FHA and VA loan programs. The USDA Rural Development Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program is commonly referred to as the USDA loan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In canada, CMHC is equivalent to FHA loan</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"partnerships\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#partnerships\" aria-label=\"partnerships permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>partnerships</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As a way to get started investing in real estate without a large amount of money, partnerships can  be a great option. This chapter covers partnerships and explains a few ways you can use them to invest in real estate without a large amount of money.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your brand consists of yourself and your product. They are two sides of the same coin, and you need both to develop your real estate brand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your personal brand is built through three primary areas: reputation, knowledge, and experience. People can smell that guy coming from a mile away. Never pretend to know more than you do, but use your gaps in knowledge as motivation to grow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your BRRRR approach requires you to develop a strong and consistent product, which is your service. You need to make sure your service is excellent, and it needs to be worth selling. People need to trust your brand, and they will only do so if the quality and profitability of the product you represent is trustworthy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you build yourself into a trustworthy brand, the money will follow. When real estate investing becomes your passion, you will find that you can’t help but talk about it. In turn, the people you talk to about it will talk to their friends about you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are four different ways you can work with a Bob, and all of them involve giving up a portion of your profit to the investor, but obtaining a greater share in return. The first is an equity partnership, the second is a down payment equity partnership, the third is a private lending partnership, and the fourth is a credit partnership.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Before partnering with someone, you must speak with a CPA and a lawyer who specializes in this kind of thing. Even something as simple as having your partner put in money at the wrong step can cost you thousands of dollars in taxes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While partnerships can be beneficial when it comes to growing your business, they also have their disadvantages. The main reason why partnerships fail is because of personality conflicts. In addition, differences in opinion and suspicion/trust issues can cause problems as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you rely on someone else, setting expectations as to how something should be done is easy. However, when your partner doesn’t live up to your expectations, it’s easy to grow bitter and blame him or her. One thing you can do to curtail this is to consistently underpromise and overdeliver.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you are the sole proprietor of a business, taxes and accounting are much simpler than when you have partners. The more partners you have, however, the more complicated the bookwork becomes and the more time-consuming and costly tax season becomes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"home-equity-loanslines-of-credit\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#home-equity-loanslines-of-credit\" aria-label=\"home equity loanslines of credit permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>home equity loans/lines of credit</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A home equity line of credit, or HELOC, is similar to a home equity loan, but even though you are allowed to borrow a predetermined amount of money, that money is not necessarily dispersed at the start of the loan. It’s available for you to borrow and pay back with flexibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Home equity loans are a great way to get extra money when you need it the most. They generally have low interest rates, and the only risk you take is if your house’s value decreases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A home equity loan or line of credit requires that you have equity in your home. The difference between what you owe on your home and its fair market value is known as equity. Lenders calculate this figure as a percentage known as loan to value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The best LTV for a home equity loan is generally around 75%. Anything higher than that is usually considered a HELOC, which stands for home equity loan. With a home equity line of credit, the interest rate is generally tied to the Prime Rate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another strategy for using your home’s equity to invest in real estate is by refinancing the loan through the bank after the repairs are made and the seasoning period is over. This allows you to pay off the home equity loan, which frees up your residence home equity to be reinvested.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The second option is to get a business line of credit from a commercial bank or a portfolio lender. This allows you to access the equity in your properties, which is substantial in some cases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overleveraging can be dangerous because it restricts your choices. If you don’t plan on selling, and you have a fixed rate mortgage, being underwater may not be a big deal to you, because your payment won’t change. However, overleveraging does remove options, and having options is critical to success in real estate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By using your home’s equity to fund your real estate purchase, you’re reducing the amount of cash flow you receive. Getting a good deal on the property is even more crucial to make up for this reduction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The third danger of home equity loans and lines of credit is their potential for an adjustable rate. This is when you must conduct a Worst Case Scenario Analysis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Equity is the difference between what you owe on your property and what it could sell for. For example, if you owe $50,000 on your home and it is worth $150,000, you have approximately $100,000 in equity. A home equity loan is a loan you can take out from a lender that is secured by the equity in your home. In other words, if you don’t pay the loan back, the lender can take your personal home and resell it to pay the debt. A home equity loan is also known as a “second mortgage,” because it is generally subservient to your primary mortgage. This means that in the case of a foreclosure, the primary mortgage would get paid off first, followed by the second. Before we get too deep into how to use a home equity loan, let’s talk about the difference between the two types of equity products:1. Home Equity Loan – A home equity loan is a mortgage product wherein all funds are disbursed at the beginning of the loan, with a definitive term length and equal monthly payments. For example, you may take out a $50,000 home equity loan at 3.75% payable for 15 years. The payment would be roughly $363 per month for the entire 15 years, or until you paid the loan off. You might think of a home equity loan as similar to a car loan or a normal home mortgage. These loans can have either a fixed (unchanging) interest rate or one that is variable (subject to change with the economy). 2. Home Equity Line of Credit – A home equity line of credit, or HELOC, is similar to a home equity loan, but even though you are allowed to borrow a predetermined amount of money, that money is not necessarily dispersed at the start of the loan. Instead, it is available for you to borrow and pay back with flexibility. If this is a bit confusing for you, don’t worry. Let me give you a really simple analogy: think of it like a credit card. You can borrow money, up to a certain amount, and pay it back at will, though you are required to make at least a minimum payment each month based on the amount you have used. The minimum payment is often simply just the interest that accrued during that month, but some lines of credit require a higher payment than just the interest. For example, you may have a $50,000 limit on your home equity line of credit, but you only use $20,000 of it. If your interest rate on the line of credit is 10%, your monthly interest payment would be $166.67 ($20,000 x 10% / 12). If you paid only the interest each month, your loan balance would never go down, because you would never be paying back the principal. A HELOC typically has a variable interest rate, though fixed rate versions are available</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As the name would imply, a home equity loan or line of credit will require you to have equity to qualify. Therefore, let’s take a few minutes to explore what equity is and why it matters. As mentioned earlier, equity is the difference between what you currently owe on your home and the fair market value of that home. For example, if you owe $50,000 on a home whose current value is $80,000, you have approximately $30,000 in equity (not including the costs required to sell the property if you wanted to)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When determining your ability to obtain a home equity line of credit, the most important number to clearly understand is known as “loan to value,” or LTV. The LTV is a percentage that shows the ratio between what you owe and what the property is worth. The higher the percentage, the less equity you have</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This calculation will give you a percentage, which is your LTV. So, revisiting the example I just used, if you owed $50,000 on a home worth $80,000, the calculations would look likeLTV = $50,000 / $80,000 = 62.5%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Today, lenders have learned from the mistakes of the past, and the days of getting 125% LTV loans and lines of credit are gone. More typically, the highest you’ll probably see is around 90% LTV, but even that may be difficult to find. In other words, if your home is currently worth $100,000, the bank will likely cap the total amount you can borrow across all loans at $90,000. So, if you have a first mortgage with a balance of $70,000, and the lender will allow you to borrow 90% (or $90,000 total), you could potentially obtain a loan or line of credit for a maximum of $20,000.Keep in mind that as with nearly all loans, you will need to meet certain credit and income minimums to obtain the lending, and rates and terms will differ based on your LTV, debt, credit, income, and other factors. You may have a ton of equity in your property, but if you are rocking a 520 credit score, obtaining a home equity loan or line of credit will be nearly impossible. Be sure to shop around to various banks when considering a home equity line of credit. In my small town, rates can vary by as much as 10% between banks. I feel sorry for all those people who are paying 13.5% at X Bank while I’m paying just 3.5% at Y Bank. Don’t be like them. Get out there, make some phone calls, and shop around to get the best rate possible on your home equity loan or line of credit</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"strategies-for-using-hard-money\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#strategies-for-using-hard-money\" aria-label=\"strategies for using hard money permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>strategies for using hard money</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hard money is financing that is obtained from private individuals or businesses for the purpose of real estate investments.

Lenders want to feel as though they will win no matter what, which is why they give out draws to ensure they are covered in case of a default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the lender will not fund the entire price, you have a few options: refusing to buy the property, borrowing money from another source, such as a partnership, equity line, or credit cards, or using your creativity to come up with other options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hard money loans are high risk, high cost loans that provide short term solutions to borrowers that need large amounts of money fast. Because of this, hard money loans are best used as a temporary solution when other conventional loans have dried up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The hard-money-to-refinance strategy involves using hard money to buy a property, renovate it, and then refinance it. However, this may not be possible if you cannot obtain a loan.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"raising-private-money-to-fund-your-deals\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#raising-private-money-to-fund-your-deals\" aria-label=\"raising private money to fund your deals permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>raising private money to fund your deals</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Private money is money provided by nonprofessional lenders to fund your real estate deals. It can be used for short-term or long-term investments, and the rates and terms will depend on the lender and the property.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Private money raising involves finding lenders who are willing to provide you with funds for your property investments. It is important to impress them with your personal brand and the strength of the deal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Private money lenders are accessible if you search for them. Private money lenders are not insured by the government, and can therefore be rather risky, but they can also be very profitable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Searching public records for lenders is a great way to find willing lenders. Although you can locate these people through the methods mentioned above, you can also take a more direct approach and locate them through public records.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Networking is the process of building relationships with people to obtain business. You are not a salesman asking for money; you are a businessperson holding an opportunity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Networking is a crucial element in any real estate investor’s arsenal, and it can open up doors to many new clients and opportunities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain to the lender that these are investments, not sure bets, and that there is risk involved with any investment. However, as long as the lender gets their money back plus interest, they will make money. Furthermore, they will have a lien on the property that gives them full legal rights to seize the property if you break the agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sharing your numbers with a potential lender helps build trust, especially if you have done your research and shown them the numbers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Getting a private lender to agree to work with you on a deal is hard, since they are usually extremely conservative and only want to work with people they can trust. Once they commit, have them sign an agreement in writing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Private money lenders can be a great resource for investors who don’t want to rely on banks or other institutional lenders. However, not all private money lenders are created equal, and it is important to do your due diligence before contracting with any of them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Private money lenders, also known as bank lenders or institutional lenders, provide loans to individuals or companies that would not qualify for a conventional bank loan. Lenders provide loans from $25,000 to millions of dollars, and charge interest rates between 10% and 25%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Private money is used in three different ways: borrowed in the form of a private money loan, pooled in the form of a blind pool, and invested in the form of a one-off.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The author calls the assets in a blind pool real estate, but defines it as no direct security, as there is in the case of a Loan. This implies that loans are not securities, but investments into the funds are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The author likes to use a limited partnership to raise money for real estate investment because it is flexible and easy to manage. The investor is the owner of the company, and the manager is the general partner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having a full-time employee to recruit investors is a great strategy, but be prepared to offer different funds with richer profit shares to attract more investors. Some investors don’t care about the return, they just want a larger share.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Private investors are a great source of capital for a rehabber as they are willing to invest their money in a project with the expectation of getting it back after a year with a 10 to 15 percent return. They are also willing to loan money to other investors, which helps expand the pool of money available for purchase.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The biggest legal issue you may face when raising private money is soliciting for money, which is publicly asking for it. The laws surrounding this have become extremely strict in the past 80 years, and there are still a lot of gray areas that you must be aware of.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although using private money is a good approach to buy property, it has its risks, and it is not suitable for everyone. It requires a great deal of networking and dealing with personalities, and the rates may be higher than those you would get with a conventional bank.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"lease-options\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#lease-options\" aria-label=\"lease options permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>lease options</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A lease option is a legal agreement between a property owner and a tenant that stipulates that the tenant has the exclusive right to purchase the property at a specified date. The tenant does not have to buy the property, but they cannot sell it to anyone else during the specified period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A lease option is a type of real estate investment that involves the purchase of a property with the intent of renting it out. The investor leases the property from the owner, who grants them the exclusive right to buy the property at a predetermined price within a certain period of time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are many benefits that a lease option provides to both the landlord and the tenant, and it’s a great way for the tenant to get started in the real estate business while keeping a constant rental property.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A lease option is a type of real estate investment that involves buying the option to buy a piece of real estate for a set period of time. The investor decides how long they want the option to last, and once that time is up, they either buy the property or let it go.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The lease option is a way for the investor to offer tenants the chance to purchase the property after a set period of time for a specified price. The investor acts as the lessor, and collects the option fee from the buyer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lease option is similar to the traditional option in which the investor leases the property from the owner and then rents it out. However, in this case, the investor leases the property from the wholesaler instead of the owner, and then sells the lease to the property owner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The lease option sandwich is a type of investment strategy that involves two separate</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>transactions on both sides of the deal. The first is the lease option, which is when the investor purchases a property from the current owner and leases it out. The second is the purchase of the house from the renter, which is completed after five years.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The lease option is another way for the investor to purchase a property without having to put in much effort, as the investor only has to lease the property from the owner, and not buy it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The more time you have on your contract, the more options you have. It is also important to let the owner know what you’re doing so that no one is surprised.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Treat your lease option agreements as a chance to create a win-win-win scenario and help others get what they want as well. Use your power for good, not evil. This means only entering a lease option with tenants who could very reasonably obtain a loan within several years, without charging an exorbitant option fee.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The fourth strategy is known as a master lease option. It works similarly to a lease option in that there’s a lease, a lessor, a lessee, and an option fee. However, with an MLO, the lessee generally pays all the expenses associated with the property, including taxes, insurance, and any maintenance concerns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another problem that could arise is major repairs being required after the tenant has moved out, which the landlord is responsible for. This is something to keep in mind.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The author has found that the lease option is a flexible way for investors to buy property, especially if they are just starting out. It gives them the ability to purchase a home and then tailor it to their liking without having to pay for a full home renovation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"seller-financing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#seller-financing\" aria-label=\"seller financing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>seller financing</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>what are percentages of mortgage free homes in Canada and US?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The term seller financed refers to a property where the seller provides the financing. This can be done through a bank, a private lender, or even the seller themselves. The seller obtains a great interest rate on their money, while the buyer does not have to deal with a bank and pays just 5K for the property.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seller financing is another way for you to purchase a home, but it comes with risks such as the due-on-sale clause which gives the bank the right to demand full payment of the loan if the property is sold. This clause makes sense, as otherwise the bank would be liable for any unpaid balances after a sale.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>only use seller financing when sellers owns the home free and clear (i.e: when sellers has no loans on the property)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are many benefits to using seller financing, such as the fact that you aren’t required to put down as much money, since the seller is covering the rest. You also avoid having to deal with banks, which can make the difference between a deal and no deal for many people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some sellers choose to sell via seller financing rather than just getting cashed out because they want monthly income, better ROI, or to avoid paying taxes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The fourth reason to consider seller financing is if you can’t otherwise sell the property. This might be the case if it’s in terrible shape, or if you’re trying to unload a property that is not worth much.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another creative use of seller financing is to allow the seller to finance just part of the deal, with a traditional lender financing the remainder. This can be done with a second mortgage, but you need to inquire about lender policies before attempting it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can use seller financing to purchase properties, especially if you are able to get a loan from a lender. This allows you to purchase a property at a lower price than what it’s worth, and then refinance it for what it’s worth plus the amount of the loan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although seller financing can be a great option for both parties, it comes with risks and dangers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This section will discuss the three most common concerns associated with seller financing, as well\nas provide tips on how to overcome them.</p>\n<p>#9</p>\n<p>The author recommends that investors learn to be experts at wholesaling as it is one of the most\npopular methods for newbies to get into real estate investing.

Screening your tenant is one of the most important steps you can take to ensure a positive landlording experience, especially with a lease option sandwich. Although tenant-screening practices are beyond the scope of this book, the most important things you can do are as follows: • Always run a background check on your tenant. Look for evictions, criminal activities, etc.• Make sure the tenant/buyer has good enough credit. Their credit score doesn’t need to be 800 for them to qualify, but it needs to be reasonable/improvable for them to be able to get a mortgage to cash you out eventually.• Look for stability. A tenant who moves every six months without reason is probably not a great candidate.• Don’t discriminate. Doing so could land you in jail, so know your local and federal discrimination laws and adhere to them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"rules-of-the-new-rich\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#rules-of-the-new-rich\" aria-label=\"rules of the new rich permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>rules of the new rich</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>4 old rules to break</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on becoming an expert at one thing.</li>\n<li>Come up with a remarkable idea.</li>\n<li>Set goals and work toward them.</li>\n<li>Give customers what they want.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"4-new-rules-to-implement\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#4-new-rules-to-implement\" aria-label=\"4 new rules to implement permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4 new rules to implement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>RULE 1: Don’t Focus on One Thing.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid a single point of failure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t build your wealth around one thing ⇒  if it doesn’t work out, you’re destroyed, and you have to start again from scratch.

If things aren’t as expected, renegotiate or walk away.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>During due diligence, you’ll want to find out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How they acquire and retain customers</li>\n<li>How much time they spend on the business</li>\n<li>Whether they have any financial or legal liabilities</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payment terms are not the same thing as sales price ⇒ you can pay the sales price upfront or over time or even use clawbacks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few tactics to juice a business after you buy it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Double pricing. Do this the moment you take over a company — only for addicted users. If the product was free, start charging. If pricing was already established, double it. As consumers we love “free,” but we also believe that we get what we pay for. And we’re willing to pay for something that brings us value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Focus on getting current customers to pay more. Step 1 is about scaling your prices for new customers. But you can double your business without adding a single new customer by getting your current user base to pay you more, or to buy more from you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Reduce your land and accelerate your expand.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Our job is to land as fast as we can in the smallest thing that we can and then expand,” says Medina. “The phrase we have here is ‘make them a customer.’ The moment you make them a customer the magic shows up.”</li>\n<li>“If you keep that user active and successful, you’re going to retain them forever.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optimize SEO. The options for search engine optimization (SEO) tools are endless but you can optimize your SEO for free, so make this a focus as soon as a company is yours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“If you want to spike your SEO beyond organic content I recommend using SEMrush. It’s the platform I use and understand despite knowing very little about SEO. It’s a great tool for beginners to get an edge.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Change where your payment pop-up shows. If you don’t have a pay wall yet, you already know you should add one. But also make sure you’re adding it in the right spot. Tying payments to usage metrics is such an effective approach because the more someone uses something, the more likely they are to get addicted to it, or rely on its utility, and be willing to pay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Understand the actions that turn leads into customers. For a brick-and-mortar store, you always want customers to walk to the back of the store. That action gets them to see more products and potentially pick things up off end caps. It’s why the most alluring section in the store — the sale rack — is always at the back. Digital properties also need customers to do certain things to become sticky. Facebook knows they need to get you to add seven new friends in the first seven days for you to get addicted to the platform. Dashlane, a password management app, knows that free users are most likely to turn into paying customers if they do two things within the first five hours of installing the app: add ten or more passwords, and install the app on at least two devices. So Dashlane CEO Emmanuel Schalit and his team doubled down on getting new users to do these things with as little effort as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch an affiliate program or partner network. This incentivizes others to help you drive sales by giving them a cut of revenue for customers they send your way. The most important thing about an affiliate program is to make sure you set up an offer that other people are likely to then sell through to their audience — 30 percent of the sale price is a motivating number, for example. Once you have that structure set up you can decide whether you want to use software to manage the program.

A quick way to confirm this is by researching whether a town’s rental rates and property values dipped in 2008. Just Google “property data” + 2008 + the city or county in which you’re looking to buy. Browse the results until you find the Property Search Map.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Real estate agents have access to deals via their multiple listing service (MLS). Because agents want to represent you when you buy, their goal is to help you find a deal. So ask your agent: “Can you add my email to your MLS for any multifamily deals that come on the market anywhere in the county?” When listings come in, you’ll automatically see the data, which will include rental information.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“So aside from door knocking, target pocket listings.

This is called “stress testing” a deal.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Step 1: Find a great deal. Go to a real estate agent in your market and ask them for direct access to their “Back-end MLS.” They’ll put your email in their system and anytime a new deal comes on the market, you’ll get an email.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Step 2: Figure out how much money you can make. Peek at these deals every now and then and compare the selling price to the rental income. The MLS will have rental income listed if it exists. Look for deals where rent makes up at least 1 percent of the total deal value. If the sale price is $200K, you’re looking at a good deal if rents add up to about $2K.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Step 3: Finance the deal with no money down. Minimize the cash you need. The largest chunk of cash you pay in a real estate deal is the down payment. If you’re living in the place you’re buying, expect to put 5 percent down. If you’re renting, expect to put down 20 percent. Our next step details how to get out of paying this money down.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Step 4: Manage your property without spending time. Find the property management company you want to use to manage your unit after the purchase. Your business is worth about 10 percent of rental income per month. If you make $2K in monthly rent, the property management company will take $200 per month or $2,400 per year. If you intend to hold the property for life, let’s say fifty years, that money starts to add up. Ask your property management company to write you a $4,800 check (two years of property management fees); otherwise tell them you won’t do the deal and they’ll miss out on a lifetime of 10 percent of your rental income.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Step 5: Close the deal. Sit back and collect your monthly payment. In my example that’s $500/month.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"finding-deals-off-market\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#finding-deals-off-market\" aria-label=\"finding deals off market permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>finding deals (off-market)</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>working it backwards</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deals - i.e: 24 deals (2/month)</li>\n<li>Budget - $24,000/year ($1,000/deal)</li>\n<li>Offers - 5 offers to get 1 deal 24 deals x 5 offers = 120 offers or 10/month</li>\n<li>Appointments - 8 appointments for 5 offers 8 ÷ 5 = 1.6 appt/offer … 120 offers x 1.6 = 192 appointments or 16/mo</li>\n<li>Leads\n<ul>\n<li>4 leads / appointment</li>\n<li>192 appt. x 4 = 768 leads / year - or -64 leads / month (32 leads = 1 deal)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lead Campaigns\n<ul>\n<li>Lead Generation Campaigns -> of Leads/month -> Cost/month</li>\n<li><strong>Radio Ad</strong> -> 9 -> $300</li>\n<li>Newspaper Ads -> 2 -> $250</li>\n<li><strong>Direct Mail - Owners w/ equity (890/mo)</strong> -> 8 -> $668</li>\n<li>Direct Mail - Tax Sale (700/year) -> 3 -> $525</li>\n<li>Direct Mail - Expired Listings (120/mo) -> 6 -> $90</li>\n<li>Direct Mail - Preforeclosure (120/mo) -> 6 -> $90</li>\n<li>Car Sign -> 3 -> $0</li>\n<li>Pole/Yard Signs -> 5 -> $10</li>\n<li><strong>Birddog System - Vacant Houses</strong> -> 15 -> $150</li>\n<li><strong>Referrals (newsletter, network, business cards)</strong> -> 10 -> $75</li>\n<li>Total: 67 $2,158</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Next Actions</li>\n<li>Diversity of lead generation!</li>\n<li>What works today, might not tomorrow\n<ul>\n<li>Ex: Newspaper ads</li>\n<li>Ex: Direct Mail - absentee owner</li>\n<li>Ex: Signs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Referral prospecting =\n<ul>\n<li>High leverage</li>\n<li>Resilient performance</li>\n<li>Farm system</li>\n<li>Worth focusing on long-term!!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Driving For Dollars</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick a target neighborhood</li>\n<li>Schedule drive or walk</li>\n<li>Look for (1) vacants (2) Fixer-uppers (3) Legal proceedings</li>\n<li>Reach out to the owner!

If weekly food delivery is big, don’t try to compete with HelloFresh and Blue Apron. Rather, figure out the infrastructure that those businesses rely on and offer it to them.”</p>\n<p>“Joining the New Rich has only two requirements: a desire for more free time to do what you want while making money on your terms, and ambition. I can’t teach ambition, so you’ll need to bring your own.”</p>\n<p>“The key is to analyze a business and pinpoint a need it’s not meeting for its customers — and then meet that need yourself.”</p>\n<p>“However you start out, my only rule is that you’re always pursuing three new opportunities at the same time. Once a venture is up and running, you’re going to set it on autopilot so it only takes an hour or two of your time per month.”</p>\n<p>“That’s why the rules of baseball allow three chances to swing at a good pitch. The same goes for your business ventures. Sometimes you’ll miss those good balls because you’re not looking; or you’ll have other life emergencies that keep you from calculating that perfect swing. It’s OK to miss, but it’s important that you actually swing at those good balls.”</p>\n<p>“Another big reason it’s so important to swing at those good balls is that when you swing and miss, you get to diagnose why you missed. Any venture you attempt and then shut down accelerates your learning. Swinging at each good opportunity sets you up to learn three times faster than if you’d never tried.”</p>\n<p>“You won’t have time to work on three huge, time-consuming projects at once. So focus 80 percent of your time on one project — the one that brings in the most money or that has the potential to be your biggest earner. Split the other 20 percent of your time between the two remaining ventures.”</p>\n<p>“I’m an investor in a hostel where I live in Austin, Texas. One thing I’m betting on is that as we move into the next four or five years, people are going to hate the idea of paying rent. They’ll much rather pay a monthly subscription fee to live anywhere they want in the world. If I want to tap into that demand, I’ll have to own hostels in multiple cities around the world. People will pay me one fee of, say, $1K per month and they can choose to stay in whichever one of my properties they want, whenever they want. They’ll have location freedom.”</p>\n<p>“That’s essentially what you’re doing when you’re copying — you’re looking for the patterns that got your competitors to the top. Then you’re using that information to match or beat them. When you do this, you’re essentially getting a free business lesson. If you don’t copy these free lessons, you’ll have to do what those with less knowledge do: pay to learn the lessons yourself.”</p>\n<p>““I’ve always thought that each person invented himself … that we are each a figment of our own imagination. The problem is, most people have no imagination.” — David Geffen</p>\n<p>“Imagine how your life would change if you didn’t buy these items unless you could actually afford to buy one every day. This is a good rule to use, and it’s also why most goals are so dangerous. When a goal is small enough to seem doable, even if it’s hard, you focus on the win and never put effort into mastering the process that will get you that result plus more (over and over again).”</p>\n<p>“Systems thinking requires you to give up making money today in exchange for taking the time, energy, and sweat equity to set up systems that will do the work for you in the future. It’s a lot of up-front work, and that’s the problem for most people. They prefer the short-term win. They need the instant gratification.”</p>\n<p>“Build systems around the things that take up most of your time. Sadly, most people don’t even know what those things are. How many of us are constantly busy but can’t look back on our day and say what we did? It’s all a blur. If that’s you (and even if it’s not), spend a week documenting what you’re doing. This kind of awareness forces you to be reflective and intentional, not reactive to whatever thing is in front of you.”</p>\n<p>“This is the essence of systems leverage. If you have a clear system, it can be done faster and cheaper by somebody (or even something) other than you.”</p>\n<p>“Getting your system set up is more important than deciding you want to make $1M per year. That’s because once you have the bones of your system set up, the way you crank up production is by changing your inputs and outputs, better managing your stocks, and creating feedback loops that give you a true unfair advantage against your competitors.”</p>\n<p>“Think about all of your expenses right now. Now go negotiate all of them down using hard and soft power (hard: “I’m canceling my account unless you give me a $100/month discount”; soft: “I’m trying to save money and it would mean a lot if you could decrease monthly payments for two months until the business regains its footing”).”</p>\n<p>“a tool called Acuity that lets the CEOs pick a time from my calendar. No need for a middle person to deal with scheduling. Immediately after the interview happens Acuity sends the CEO an email to thank them and let them know when the interview will go live.”</p>\n<p>“Make sure the systems you’re spending most of your time and money on scaling have a direct correlation to additional cash flow, whether that’s downloads that translate to sponsor dollars, website impressions that convert to an increase in your average cart checkout size, if you’re an e-commerce brand, or a system for marketing the newspaper that drives more people to your brick-and-mortar location.”</p>\n<p>“People often get stuck working on systems that suck up their time but don’t bring in cash. It’s so tempting to lie to yourself because a system feels good when it isn’t actually accomplishing anything. So be hyperintentional about where you’re spending your time and ruthlessly kill any systems that don’t have a direct correlation to growing your bank account.”</p>\n<p>“I came up with a very simple “Decision System” I filter these kinds of purchases through. It saves me energy every time this sort of purchase comes up, and its simplicity gives it a very high utility value. If, with my current monthly income stream, I couldn’t afford to purchase one of these things every day, I don’t buy it. Simple as that. That’s the rule. For cars, houses, vacations, dinners, everything.”</p>\n<p>“That’s the beauty of what I call “selling pickaxes to gold miners.” You let the gold miners do all the work and then siphon profits off the market they’ve created. This works in B2B selling and on the consumer side, too. So while everyone’s spending money on fidget spinners, you might sell the “Fidget Spinner Sticker Kit.” While Amazon pulls a profit from third-party sellers, you might create an inventory-tracking program for those sellers. Pickaxes are hiding behind every popular marketplace. They can be hard to spot at first, but the more you start thinking this way, the more they’ll show themselves to you.”</p>\n<p>“Study the greats to find history’s lucrative patterns. Read biographies of successful businesspeople and identify the behaviors and strategies that got them to the top. You can also turn to documentaries — like American Genius and The Men Who Built America — to learn how pioneers built businesses.”</p>\n<p>“Whatever your business or industry, remember that the gold mine is the hot trend. That’s the part of the iceberg above the water that everyone sees and wants. The pickax is the part of the iceberg below the water — the part nobody can see but that the hot trend relies on to function.”</p>\n<p>“Victor Levitin created CrazyLister in 2013 in response to sellers’ frustration over the complicated process of posting items on eBay.”</p>\n<p>“There’s rarely a magic bullet for immersing yourself in a new industry — but Toptal is pretty close. You can know nothing about a particular business area, but post your project on Toptal and they will recommend experts for you to work with. So let’s say you want to develop an app that helps salons book appointments more efficiently. You can post that exact sentence on Toptal and they’ll help you find mobile developers. It’s that simple.”</p>\n<p>“That’s a big blind spot for people. They shut down opportunities they’re not interested in rather than letting the conversation play out. But remember, your best analysis is done when you have people’s best and final offers in hand, whether that’s employees you want to recruit, CEOs you’re trying to sell your company to, or customers you’re trying to sell a product to. You want to be as close to the finish line as possible before you decide on anything so that you have the best and most accurate data possible. Do this even if you don’t want the deal. Remember, your best position in a negotiation is when you don’t need it to work out. Your upper-hand approach may get you terms so good that you’ll change your mind.”</p>\n<p>“Most people, though, won’t accomplish anything. They’ll get charged up by a project’s potential, obsess over their to-do lists, then feel paralyzed by the enormity of it all. Or at best, they’ll get through 10 percent of what needs to be done before they quit.”</p>\n<p>“Every time you switch tasks it takes five to ten minutes to reengage with the thing you were doing beforehand. If you switch tasks ten times during the day, that’s one hundred minutes, or almost two hours of productivity you lose every day.”</p>\n<p>“Men acquire a particular quality by constantly acting a certain way.” — Aristotle</p>\n<p>““Invest in businesses any idiot could run because someday one will.” — Peter Lynch</p>\n<p>“Employees are usually an organization’s biggest expense, so I avoid business models that rely on them. Digital products are perfect for this because you can tap the huge talent pool of freelancers on Toptal.com, Freelancer.com, Fiverr.com, etc., to do the work you need on a project basis. When the work is done you put the product on autopilot and print money until you decide to do another update (then tweak, test, and back on autopilot).”</p>\n<p>“You don’t want to spend time building an audience from scratch, or learn the hard way that there is no audience for your product.”</p>\n<p>“So, my basic strategy, step-by-step: Buy free digital properties with a big user base. Hire a Toptal developer to put up a pay wall that appears after someone uses the product a certain number of times. Reinvest the revenue back into the company as needed. Also use the income from this business to buy other companies (and to fill my pockets!).”</p>\n<p>“When I discovered Mail2Cloud it had already been in the Chrome Web Store for five years. It was rated as a top recommendation in the store’s Productivity category and had more than two thousand five-star reviews.”</p>\n<p>“It was no Google, but Mail2Cloud clearly had a solid spot in a specific distribution channel — the Chrome Web Store’s Productivity corner. Mail2Cloud’s user data on ChromeBeat.com also showed that it had been consistently adding one hundred new users every day for the last four years.That was enough information to make me want to keep exploring.”</p>\n<p>“Start searching: Browse sites like AppAnnie.com, the Chrome Web Store, the Salesforce AppExchange, the Intuit App Center, or the Apple App Store for the top mobile apps in different industries and categories. See what companies rank high on G2 Crowd. Search CrunchBase.com for companies that raised capital but haven’t gotten new funding in the last three years. They’re probably failing, and you’re likely to get them for a great deal. I have several friends who have bought companies for $30K or less after those companies raised at least $10M in start-up capital. I don’t recommend that beginners do this, but if you build up the experience to take on this kind of acquisition, always make sure you can identify the reason the company is failing and whether it’s something you can easily turn around.”</p>\n<p>“When searching for apps or Chrome extensions I go entirely by reviews, number of users, and the date the software was last updated. If reviews and users are high and the last update was more than a few months ago, I consider it a prospect.”</p>\n<p>“Once I take over a company I run it through my playbook to get it operating at top efficiency.”</p>\n<p>“Starting a company from the ground up teaches you what’s needed to run one well. I recommend that before you buy a business, try starting one yourself just so you can learn. If you never obsess over creating a system that kills inefficiencies and generates cash flow you won’t know how to recognize one when you see it in another company. It also helps you appreciate what you’re getting when you do buy one. These companies already have systems set up. They already have customers. You’re just running tweaks on them.”</p>\n<p>“Buying is also much more of a beginner’s game than investing. It sounds counterintuitive, but you need more cash in hand to invest in a business than you do to buy one. CEOs won’t waste time talking to someone offering a $1K investment in their company. They want at least six figures. Even very small businesses need a good chunk of cash before they’ll consider forking over equity. Ming’s Yummy Thai Food, a two-person operation, needed $6K for my investment to have a meaningful impact on their cash flow. Firehouse Hostel needed $11K. By comparison, you can buy a company for very little money, or no money at all, if you find a motivated seller. So focus on buying companies if you’re just starting out. As you keep doing it, you’ll eventually start writing investment checks with the extra cash flow. One revenue stream spawns another. Exactly what you want.”</p>\n<p>“The smarter thing to do, and what I do when I’m interested in making a larger investment in a company, is ask to see their numbers. I need them to show me at least a three- or four-year financial history before I consider investing. Anything less is too risky. And if they don’t have a structure for reporting that lets me look at their historical financials and see growth, I’m out. I also need to have confidence that once I put money in, I’ll get updated financial reports every month. If that doesn’t exist I stay away from the investment.”</p>\n<p>“One of my key strategies is to look for a business that is making a big monthly payment on something. If I can pay for that thing up front, erasing the payment, it frees up their cash. I’ll then tie my return to the growth of the business, which I know I can help drive with my distribution channels.”</p>\n<p>“How you find people with big lists will depend on your industry. I’m in software, so I’d go to sites like G2Crowd.com or Siftery.com and see who has the most users. Obviously if they have a lot of users they have those users’ email addresses. Then I’d do cold outreach to those companies. Paved.com and Sponsored.tech are two more outlets for access to big email lists.”</p>\n<p>“In terms of finding people who’d want to buy access to lists, listen to podcasts and notice who is sponsoring them. Those same people are looking to pay for additional exposure. Also Google keywords associated with your industry, or whatever the list is about that you’re brokering a deal with. Notice who is running ads for that thing, then reach out to them and say: Hey, I noticed you’re spending money on Google ads. You might get a better return if you spend some money with me and email this list, which is catered to the same keywords that you’re running on Google.”</p>\n<p>Ironic given Facebook copying Snapchat’s stories sent Snap into a bit of a death spiral — “People are going to copy your product if you build great stuff. Just because Yahoo has a search box doesn’t make it Google.” — Evan Spiegel</p>\n<p>“Have you seen those sections at the bottom of major blogs that showcase sponsored content, or “related posts”? Companies like Outbrain and Taboola have dominated this space for years, but it didn’t stop John Lemp at Revcontent from throwing his weight into the competition. In 2017, Revcontent processed $184M of ad spend through its platform, collecting 25 percent of that as revenue. This is a prime example in which a big thinker ignored the conventional wisdom that “you must have a new idea!” Instead, he went right after business models already proven and is now chipping away at their lead.”</p>\n<p>“BuiltWith.com is a site that will tell you what technologies other websites use. In other words, it lets you see what pickaxes the gold miners are using. If you were interested in the e-commerce space, it’d be valuable to know who currently has how much market share. You can then reverse engineer why the winners are winning and losers are losing to increase your chances of success in the same space. Go to BuiltWith.com and click TOOLS in the dropdown to start exploring trends.”</p>\n<p>“SimilarWeb is a tool that tells you where websites get most of their traffic from. If I wanted to build a competitor to Todoist.com, I’d go to SimilarWeb, type in “Todoist.com,” and this report would generate: I immediately learn that the majority of Todoist.com traffic comes from LifeHacker.com and Ifttt.com. Go make friends with the CEOs/authors of those blogs/websites. It’s a double whammy to persuade those people to write about your new tool while at the same time hurting your competitors’ traffic.”</p>\n<p>“Use App Annie if you’re trying to study a market in the mobile app space. For example, if I were analyzing the document signing space, I might explore how HelloSign ranks so well in the App Store. Going to App Annie and searching “HelloSign” creates this word cloud that tells me what people search in the App Store to find HelloSign.”</p>\n<p>“Post a job and let Toptal recruiters go find you development talent. I used Balsamiq.com to wireframe different user flows for the new tool, which helps my developer better guess how much time (and money!) a project might take”</p>\n<p>“The reason I much prefer using a site like Toptal to build my initial prototype is twofold: You keep 100 percent equity in your company. You don’t increase your fixed monthly expenses as you would if you hired an employee. Also, you don’t have to worry about health coverage, birthdays, or office parties (which usually waste time).”</p>\n<p>“Once you’re done using Toptal to build your minimum viable product, you want to start figuring out ways to attack your competitors. Read their support forum if they have one and see what their most requested features are that don’t exist yet.

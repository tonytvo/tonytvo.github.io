One type of market analysis, called technical analysis, refers only to past market values to predict future values. The second type of analysis refers to indices of economic activity outside the market that, presumably, have some influence over security prices. Neither of these kinds of market analysis has proven effective, and both essentially promote speculation over reasoned, fact-based investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intrinsic value is an important concept for security analysis. However, “intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms, it is understood to be that value justified by the facts…the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct…from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excess.” Although investors cannot calculate an exact intrinsic value for a given security because so many variables are involved, a careful examination can determine whether the price the market quotes is appropriate. Securities that meet stringent safety tests and appear to be selling well below their intrinsic value can often be profitable investments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Securities traditionally fall into two categories: stocks and bonds. This classification is inadequate because it pays more attention to the form of security than to its safety and purpose. The various types of securities may be more accurately classified into three groups, each of which has its criteria for what constitutes a sound investment: fixed-value securities, including high-grade bonds and preferred stocks; variable-value senior securities, including speculative bonds and preferred stocks; and common stocks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"criteria-for-investing-in-fixed-value-securities\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#criteria-for-investing-in-fixed-value-securities\" aria-label=\"criteria for investing in fixed value securities permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Criteria for Investing in Fixed-Value Securities</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bonds are not automatically safe investments because of their form. Instead, the soundness of a bond investment derives from the issuer’s ability to pay, which is, in turn, based on its financial strength. Therefore, the investor considering purchasing a bond should ask the following questions: Is the value of the company’s business more than its debts? Can the company meet its financial obligations even in the worst-case scenario, such as a recession or depression?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although no company or industry is depression-proof, two factors contribute to a company’s resilience in hard times: dominant size within its industry and sufficient earnings to cover its bond interest by a large margin. Bonds of companies that do not meet these requirements are not considered investment grade, even if the yield is highly attractive. A high yield cannot compensate for failure to pay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preferred stocks combine the limited return of bonds with the instability of common stocks. Despite these unattractive features, preferred stocks can be safe investments if they meet the same safety requirements as a bond, and their margin of safety is large enough that management is unlikely to suspend preferred dividends. The stability of the company exceeds that required for a bond investment. These stringent requirements limit the number of investment-grade preferred stocks to a very select group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Income bonds, also called adjustment bonds, should be subject to the same strict investment criteria as preferred stocks. Guaranteed issues occupy a position between bond debt and preferred stocks. Prospective investors must carefully examine the terms of the guarantee and evaluate the guarantor’s financial strength. Even with fixed-value investments, investors should periodically evaluate their holdings. There is no such thing as a permanent investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although many bonds and preferred stocks do not meet the requirements that would qualify them as investment grade, some issues in this category may be worth purchasing because they are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Investors must avoid issues that are selling at a discount for other reasons – for example, because the company is financially unsound.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"principles-for-selection-of-fixed-value-investments\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principles-for-selection-of-fixed-value-investments\" aria-label=\"principles for selection of fixed value investments permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principles for selection of fixed-value investments</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>avoid compromising the assumed risk for an increased reward to minimize the loss of principal\n<ul>\n<li>if the risk is assumed, it should be in the form of paying a lower price (therefore lowering the principal required to acquire the security) instead of accepting a higher coupon or dividend.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"safety-is-not-measured-by-lien-but-by-the-ability-to-pay\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#safety-is-not-measured-by-lien-but-by-the-ability-to-pay\" aria-label=\"safety is not measured by lien but by the ability to pay permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>safety is not measured by Lien but by the ability to pay</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>safety is measured by the ability of the issuer to meet obligations - not by contractual rights</li>\n<li>in theory, if a business fails, the bondholder recovers his money from assets, but that often fails because:\n<ul>\n<li>property values shrink when the business fails</li>\n<li>there is difficulty in establishing legal rights</li>\n<li>there are inherent delays in receivership</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>to avoid trouble is better to seek protection after it occurs</li>\n<li>debt should bed assessed from the cashflow statement\n<ul>\n<li>“good” debt is when the company is using financed capital for an opportunity or expansion that might require a quick entry into the market</li>\n<li>“bad” debt is when the business is required to borrow to sustain operations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"obligation-possibility-should-be-assessed-in-terms-of-depression-not-prosperity\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#obligation-possibility-should-be-assessed-in-terms-of-depression-not-prosperity\" aria-label=\"obligation possibility should be assessed in terms of depression not prosperity permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>obligation possibility should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>bonds should be bought on their ability to withstand a depression or recession; relative safety is found in companies of a) dominant size and b) substantial margin or earnings over bond interests.</li>\n<li>presumption of safety based upon either the character of the industry or the amount of protection</li>\n<li>Investors should look for industries least likely to be affected by depression.</li>\n<li>investment practice recognizes the importance of the character of the industry. <strong>historically, some industries and public utilities have been more stable than others, and equally, their degree of stability has altered with time</strong>.

Before the failure, the parent company had a subsidiary paying a preferred share dividend. After the failure, the dividend was immediately discontinued.

These leases hold considerable fixed expenses on the company and ultimately impact the health of the bonds the company has issued.</li>\n<li>after identifying this concern, Graham recommends a rule of thumb for multiplying the fixed charges on the income statement by 22. This would provide a capitalization of 4.5% on all the fixed charges. This was determined by taking the inverse of 22. It’s important to note that interest rates for railroad debts during 1938 were 4.5%.

When evaluating privileged issues, consider the amount of the profit-sharing benefits per dollar invested, the proximity of the event that will trigger profit-sharing advantages and the duration of the privileges.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"criteria-for-investing-in-common-stocks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#criteria-for-investing-in-common-stocks\" aria-label=\"criteria for investing in common stocks permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Criteria for Investing in Common Stocks</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Common stocks, as a class, are much more speculative than senior issues. Yet they are important to the US financial system, and novice and expert investors eagerly follow their prices, so security analysts know how to deal with them. The false belief that common stocks were a good buy at any price – as long as the company’s earning trend was positive – partly fueled the crash of 1929. Clearly, the practice of making common-stock investments safer deserves further analysis, because the possibility of significant price appreciation will always lure investors to this type of security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although the instability of common stock prices makes any given organization a dubious investment, portfolio diversification can somewhat offset this risk.

Dividends</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Before investing in a common stock, investigate the firm’s dividend rate and its history of paying dividends. The dividend rate is important because a dollar of surplus earnings is worth more to the investor when the company chooses to pay it as a dividend instead of reinvesting it in the business. Generally, companies that pay higher dividends have higher stock prices. However, management can suspend common-stock dividends at any time, so it is important to view the company’s dividend history as an indication, but not a guarantee, of future income.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extraordinary stock dividends</strong> (stock splits), on the other hand, are largely illusory because they give investors nothing they did not already own. An improvement in this practice is for companies to pay periodic stock dividends, representing a return to the shareholders of surplus earnings reinvested in the business.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>although stock dividends and stock splits create no real value for the holders, much speculation about the value of the companies after the division is likely to occur due to the lower price.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>periodic stock dividends</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>with a periodic stock dividend, the shareholder often receives a smaller and more reasonable stock dividend that adds value over time.</li>\n<li>The company should not provide a periodic stock dividend if the amount exceeds the funds retained in earnings. The dividend could eventually exceed the company’s ability to retain earnings power, and the EPS slowly declined over a 10-year period, along with the market price.</li>\n<li>Graham suggests the dividend should be dispersed as a preferred share.\n<ul>\n<li>it doesn’t weaken the business’s capital structure like the common stock dividend.</li>\n<li>allows the company to retain earnings until a safe and manageable surplus is realized.</li>\n<li>this technique gives management flexibility and control to pay the dividend as long as they choose.</li>\n<li>once the retained earnings have been distributed, the obligation is no longer on the books once the company repurchases the preferred share.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Graham suggests that the market price of common stocks will perform similarly if management pays a healthy and sustainable dividend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>established principle of withholding dividends</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham claims that two companies with the same general business model and the same earnings will trade at different prices if the dividend policy is different. The market will value the company with the higher dividend more favourably.</li>\n<li>should a company pay a lower dividend to create stability for the owner with an assured payment, or should it pay a higher dividend and meet its obligation irregularly?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>the merits of “plowing back” earnings</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>there’re two reasons retained earnings are beneficial to the stockholder.\n<ul>\n<li>whatever was good for the company was good for the shareholder.</li>\n<li>a company that retained earnings had more agility to remain competitive in difficult markets.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>if a company sustains a favourable ROE over a long period, it means the management is properly investing the retained earnings and adding value to the shareholder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>dividend policies arbitrary and sometimes selfishly determined</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham suggests that many board members are executives and friends of executives with very large portions of shares. As a result, they might want to minimize their tax burden by receiving smaller dividends from the company.</li>\n<li>leadership may seek a larger and more impressive sized business, therefore, using retained earnings to full fill their pursuit of an ever-growing business (which may or may not add more earnings)</li>\n<li>management may seek the opportunity to purchase outstanding shares at lower prices with the retained earnings.</li>\n<li>management that pays a small dividend can pay excessive salaries to executives and top-level employees.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>arbitrary control of dividend policy complicates the analysis of common stocks</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>suggested principle for dividend payments</strong>: Graham strongly believes that a company should pay a large portion of their earnings to the shareholders. He says it’s more important for the shareholder to receive non-standard (or inconsistent) dividend rates at a higher return instead of a lower and more consistent dividend, which likely results in the company accumulating reserves that add little value.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2-earnings\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-earnings\" aria-label=\"2 earnings permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Earnings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze earnings, carefully study the company’s income statement. While earnings are undoubtedly important, security analysts have accorded them too much weight in calculating a company’s investment soundness. Management can manipulate a company’s earnings in many ways. Therefore, always examine the firm’s income statement with a critical eye. For example, businesses can engineer nonrecurring charges and profits to produce a favourable earnings trend. A firm’s accountants also can generate perceived earnings by lowering or increasing the company’s reserves or by reporting subsidiaries’ results in different ways. Companies can also misleadingly present depreciation and amortization costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Investors must pay attention to more than current earnings. They should consider both the earnings trend and the long-term earnings average – preferably seven to ten years, putting more weight on the latter number. The analyst’s job is not predicting the future of a trend or intuiting possible price changes; it is making decisions based on facts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analysts should combine the information from the balance sheet and income statement to garner the best valuation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>disadvantages of sole emphasis on earning power</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>earnings statement has more variability than the balance sheet and therefore changes the value of the business, making it appear unstable. The income statement can be more misleading than the balance sheet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>simplified statement of Wall Street’s Method of appraising common stocks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>price = Current Earnings Per Share (EPS) x Quality Coefficient</li>\n<li>how does the quality coefficient is determined?\n<ul>\n<li>probably by a whole host of factors such as dividend rate, history, size and reputation of the business. Graham suspects all these factors are dwarfed by the real factor, which is the earnings trend.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>earnings not only fluctuate but are subject to arbitrary determination</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>some of the techniques management can use to misrepresent earnings in the short term are the following\n<ul>\n<li>through allocating items to surplus (on the balance sheet) instead of revenue</li>\n<li>through misrepresented amortization charges</li>\n<li>through an amendment of the capital structure</li>\n<li>through the use of large capital funds for items that don’t pertain to the business</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>significance of foregoing to the analyst</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the end, the analyst should be able to answer three questions:\n<ul>\n<li>what are the true earnings for the period studied?</li>\n<li>what indications does the earnings record carry as to the future earning power?</li>\n<li>what standards should be applied to the income statement to arrive at a reasonable valuation?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>criticism and restatement of the income account</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the analyst will need to pay close attention to the ambiguous way the account rules can be applied\n<ul>\n<li>non-recurrent profits and losses.

This illustrates the most vicious type of accounting manipulation: taking sums out of surplus and then reporting these same sums as income in the following years. The danger of this accounting method is that the public is not likely to recognize it, and even the expert analyst might have difficulty detecting it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>reserves for inventory loss</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>companies continuously set aside reserves to absorb losses on inventory before they occur. The implication is that the income statement does not always reflect inventory losses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>other elements in inventory accounting</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>the standard procedure is to take inventory at the close of the year, measured by the lowest cost price or market price.</li>\n<li>last-in, first-out: measure the amount paid for the most recently acquired inventory. The theory behind this method is that a merchant’s selling price is related mainly to the current replacement price or the recent cost of the article sold. This method may be useful to reduce income tax if there is inventory fluctuation.</li>\n<li>the normal stock or basic-stock inventory method: a more radical method of minimizing fluctuations is the company must possess a certain physical stock of materials from year to year. This “permanent stock” would therefore keep the same value and not be imposed on price changes. To permit the base inventory to be carried at an unchanging figure on the balance sheet, the practice is to mark it down to a very low unit price, so low that it should never be necessary to reduce it further.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>idle-plant expense</strong>: the cost of carrying non-operating properties is almost always charged against income. Graham suggests it should not. Doing so, it’s misleading to the expenses of the company’s core product or service. The analyst may properly consider the idle-plant expense as belonging somewhat different from ordinary charges against operating income, as these expenses, by nature, are not part of the company’s normal operations.\n<ul>\n<li>in theory, these expenses should be temporary since the management can terminate these losses at any time by disposing of the property. Therefore, if the company chose to spend the money, Graham does not deem it logical to consider these assets equivalent to a permanent liability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>deferred charges</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>a business sometimes incurs expenses which apply to a number of years rather than a single 12-month period, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>organization expenses (legal fees, etc…)</li>\n<li>moving expenses</li>\n<li>development expenses (for new products, processes, opening up a mine, etc…)</li>\n<li>discount on obligations sold</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the company is allowed to spread these types of costs over an appropriate period of years (5 years is a customary period). It is entered upon balance sheets as deferred charges, which are written off by annual charges against earnings.</li>\n<li>it is incorrect to write off these types of expenses in a single year and against a ‘surplus’ as net income for coming years would be overstated, followed by the understated operating expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>amortization of bond discount</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>the discount should be amortized over the bond’s life by an annual charge against earnings.</li>\n<li>the write-offs could be written against surplus to eliminate future annual deductions from earnings and in that way, to make the shares appear more valuable.

This is done to benefit from the higher valuation in their balance sheet without accepting the burden of consequently higher depreciation charges against net income.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the vast majority of industrial companies follow the standard policy or charing an appropriate depreciation rate against each class of depreciable assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when the analyst knows that a company’s depreciation policy differs from the standard, there is a special reason to check the adequacy of the allowance. Comparison with a company in the same field may yield significant differences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>depreciation charges are often an issue in mergers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>concealed depreciation, such as understated depreciation, hence overstating the earnings power.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>amortization charges of oil and mining companies</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>depletion charges of mining companies</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>depletion represents using capital assets by turning them into products for sale. It applies to companies producing metals, oil and gas, sulphur, timber, etc… As the holdings, or reserves, of these products, are gradually exhausted, their value must gradually be written off through charges against earnings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>independent calculation by investor necessary</strong>: in mining, the investor must ordinarily compute his depletion allowances for his share of the mining property.</li>\n<li><strong>depletion and similar charges in the oil industry:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>in the oil industry, depletion charges are closer related to the actual cost of doing business. Large oil producers normally spend substantial sums of capital each year on new leases and wells. This is needed to make up for the shrinkage of reserves throughout continued production. In general, depletion charges are cash outlays to maintain reserves and production.</li>\n<li>Graham then provides an assessment of how some oil companies would misrepresent the actual lifetime of the asset by extending or shortening the depletion and depreciation of their assets. This was typically exercised so the company could control the market price through earnings manipulation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>the meaning of these variations to the analyst and the investor</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>analyst should seek to apply a uniform and reasonably conservative rate of amortization that reflects the realities of fixed assets.\n<ul>\n<li>depreciation on tangible assets.

A loss on the property should be charged against the year’s earnings rather than against the surplus.</li>\n<li>depletion of oil reserves. The proper principle here is that the analyst should allow for depletion based on the current market values of the oil.\n<ul>\n<li>in the case of integrated oil companies, accept the company’s depletion figure as the best available.</li>\n<li>In companies that are solely or virtually oil producers, the analyst can compute what the market is paying for the total developed oil reserves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>other types of amortization of capital assets</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>leaseholds and leasehold improvements</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>if a lessee is renting a property at a large discount to the actual cost of owning the property - and the terms of the contract are over a long period - there may be significant value to account for.</li>\n<li>oil lands are leased on a standard royalty basis, usually one-eighth of the production. Such leaseholds can be worth much more than the rental payments involved. If a company has paid money for a given leasehold, the cost is regarded as a capital investment that should be written off during the life of the lease. These charges are part of the rent paid for the property and must therefore be included in the current operating expense.</li>\n<li>when the leased property is improved with assets fixed by the lease, the cost must be written down to nothing during the life of the lease. This is due to the landlord ultimately owning the property and the tethered asset when the lease expires. The annual expense for this purpose is called “amortization of leasehold improvements.” Chain-store enterprises, and consequently, the annual write-offs may be of significant importance in their income statements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>amortization of patent</strong>: in theory, a patent should be dealt with the same way as a mining property; i.e., its cost to the investor should be written off against earnings during its remaining life.</li>\n<li><strong>amortization of goodwill</strong>: in modern accounting.

This is because depreciation is assumed to earn interest until the property is retired.</li>\n<li><em>the overall method</em>: single annual percentage to the entire depreciable property account is used, instead of varying rates to different classes of assets. The object is to arrive at a simple approximation of the actual depreciation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>retirement reserve methods</em>\n<ul>\n<li>a retirement reserve intends to have funds available when an asset retires. Over any long period, proper depreciation and proper retirement allowances should yield the same results. In reality, the majority of retirement reserve policies operate simply to understate the current loss of property value and thus overstate the earnings.</li>\n<li>various methods of calculating retirement reserves are:\n<ul>\n<li><em>percentage of gross</em>. this method would tend to approximate a regular depreciation rate if the percentage taken were adequate. Generally, this is not the case.</li>\n<li><em>fixed rate per unit of product</em>. This method resembles the previous one and is subject to the same criticism. Instead of a percentage of gross product, an example used is $2.7 in depreciation for every thousand kilowatt-hours sold.</li>\n<li><em>Overall percentage of Gross for maintenance and depreciation combined</em>. By this method, the larger the amount spent for maintenance, the smaller the amount saved in reserve for depreciation.</li>\n<li><em>discretionary deductions</em>. The annual deduction is largely based on the judgement of the management. It might be the same or varying amount from year to year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>double accounting policies on depreciation.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>regardless of what method is followed in the annual reports, practically every company follows the straight-line basis of depreciation in computing its income tax. As a result, the investor must determine whether the depreciation is representative of the linear or non-linear erosion that takes place on the value of the asset over time</li>\n<li><em>Reasons for accepting, in general, the income tax base</em>. Graham presents five major reasons for accepting the income tax figure rather than the income statement as the basis of depreciation:\n<ul>\n<li>the straight-line basis follows a definite and logical accounting theory. If there is an excessive deduction, the Treasure Department won’t’ accept it.</li>\n<li>the inadequacy of the “retirement reserve” idea has been shown by the necessity in many cases of making large transfers from surplus to support the retirement reserve.</li>\n<li>Since 1934, there has been an almost universal increase in retirement allowances. This can be perceived as a strong indicator that past allowances were too small and, therefore an overstatement of earnings.</li>\n<li>some state commissions and federal commissions have now ordered companies within their jurisdictions to follow the income tax depreciation base.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>instance when income tax basis should be rejected or questioned.</em> while Graham generally believes in accepting income tax basis, there may be times when figures in the annual report should be accepted, or even seek the third basis.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"amortization-charges-from-the-investors-viewpoint\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#amortization-charges-from-the-investors-viewpoint\" aria-label=\"amortization charges from the investors viewpoint permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>amortization charges from the investor’s viewpoint</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>problem indicated by hypothetical example</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>typical market appraisals\n<ul>\n<li>a company with less valuable assets in terms of accounting is worth considerably more than a company with a higher value asset. This is done by a single gesture of writing down company C’s assets to almost nothing immediately upon the purchase.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>a more rational approach</em>. A more practical approach would be to include the fair value of the respective assets and add that to the cash holdings. The investor might consider which depreciation method should be used.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>practical application of foregoing reasoning.</strong> depreciation is not a cash outlay but deducted as an expense on the income statement. As a result, the company reports no income, yet the cash account continues to grow because the displayed income is offset by depreciation charges.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>How to determine the proper depreciation charge</em> the investor or the analyst must come up with an estimate for depreciation which aligns with the actual conditions of the business (based on the discoverable facts).</li>\n<li><em>concept of expended depreciation</em>. The primary reason for reducing a company’s depreciation charges is that it doesn’t properly reflect the company’s cash flow. In short, as an asset’s life continues to get older, the value that it is listed on the company’s balance sheet will continue to decrease. As a result, an investor should see the value of tangible and intangible assets slowly decrease over time.</li>\n<li><em>long-term depreciation a form of obsolescence</em>. For instance, a plant may not be wearing out but rather being obsolete due to changes in the industry and the status of the corporation. This risk is rather due to the investment and not accounting. Hence it should be incorporated in the price and not in the depreciation, as it is a business risk. Therefore, the carrying value of the asset should be adjusted accordingly. The company’s management should conduct this value test for asset impairment quarterly.</li>\n<li><em>Application of foregoing in determining earning power</em>. For companies similar to a railroad, only the expended depreciation should be deducted from earnings due to maintenance, renewals and repair to a large degree.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>depreciation on apartment and office buildings</strong>. In short, the asset can’t be depreciated for more than the price paid to acquire it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>inadequate allowance for depreciation</strong>. Assets should not be written down in large amounts early in the assets’ life to make the earnings power appear more abundant during the assets’ final years of life. This represents the true cash flow of the business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>stock watering reversed</strong>. This manipulation of asset value by writing the book value up and down is interrelated with the value of the stock. This would inflate the stock prices by the higher book value of the fixed assets (known as <em>stock watering</em>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The purchases’ amortization calculation</strong>. Where the life of a mining property is limited, the investor’s calculation of amortization should be deducted from earnings. He can base this on three factors 1) the price paid for the mining property. 2) the earnings before depreciation and depletion 3) the minimum life of the mine, and alternatively, the probability of life.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>purchaser amortization of oil reserves</strong>. Depreciation and depletion charges per barrel are found by dividing the estimated remaining oil reserves into the net value of the properties on the books.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>purchaser’s amortization of patents</strong>. The question for the investor is how much she is paying for the patent when she buys the stock at a given price. This is the amount she must use for writing-off subsequent earnings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>general rule</em>. In reality, no single calculation shown above will represent stocks wholistically.

Asset Value</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To gauge asset value, inspect the business’s balance sheet. A firm’s book value per share equals the total value of its tangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. Wall Street has almost entirely superseded the importance of asset value with earnings. Although rules of thumb for the proper ratio of market price to book value vary, you still should investigate the underlying value of a business’s assets before investing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The current-asset value – that is, current assets minus liabilities – is perhaps a more significant number. It excludes both intangible and fixed assets and is, therefore, a rough approximation of the company’s value should it go into liquidation. As a general rule, if a firm’s market price is below its liquidation value, the company has either been undervalued or should be liquidated. Investors who distinguish between the undervalued issues and those performing poorly due to fundamental unsoundness can realize a significant upside.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In addition, examine the balance sheet to make sure that the company has a good cash position, that its current assets (exclusive of inventories) at least equal its current liabilities, and that it does not have a large amount of debt maturing soon, which could create refinancing problems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there should be no discount from the amount stated on the company’s books for cash and marketable securities, provided the securities are short-term or marked to the market. The same holds for property, plant, and equipment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the economic value of the assets is the reproduction costs of a new firm starting in the same industry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we first find the current market prices for the securities. Then we must adjust the book value of the firm’s accounts receivable and inventory up or down to get more realistic reproduction costs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>it is important to note that goodwill represents a prior blunder that must be ignored when calculating a company’s intrinsic value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>liabilities and equity are the sources of funds that support the assets, which are the uses to which those funds are put</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there are three types of liabilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>those that arise from the normal conduct of the business</li>\n<li>those that arise from past circumstances that are not pertinent to a new entrant</li>\n<li>the outstanding formal debt of the company.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when we start with the reproduction cost of the assets and then subtract the first two categories of liabilities, we are left with the asset value of the whole enterprise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The defining characteristic of a franchise is that it enables a firm to earn more than it needs to pay for the investments that fund its assets. The intrinsic value of a firm is either the reproduction costs of the assets, which should equal the EPV or those assets plus the competitive advantages of the firm that underlie its franchise. The initial judgment that has to be made is whether the firm currently has a competitive advantage and, if so, how strong and sustainable it is</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"significance-of-book-value\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#significance-of-book-value\" aria-label=\"significance of book value permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>significance of book value</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>balance sheet can provide the following guidance for the investor\n<ul>\n<li>it shows how much capital is invested in the business</li>\n<li>it reveals the ease of stringency of the company’s financial condition; i.e., the working-capital structure</li>\n<li>it provides an important check of the validity of reported earnings</li>\n<li>it supplies the basis for analyzing the sources of income.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>computation of book value</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>(common stock + surplus items - intangibles) / number of shares outstanding</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>treatment of preferred stock when calculating book value of common stock</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>in calculating the assets available for the common stock, the value of the preferred stock must be subtracted.

In most cases, the assets could not be sold at that value, and the earnings do not justify the figure.</li>\n<li>The practice of writing up the book value of the fixed property or cutting it down to nothing to avoid depreciation charges has made the book value have questionable application.</li>\n<li>even though Graham is very skeptical about using book value, he still believes that the book value deserves at least a fleeting glance before buying or selling shares.</li>\n<li>a stock buyer should not know that the value of the stock is entirely related to the business in question, and what he gets from his money will be in tangible resources. A business that sells at a premium does so because it earns a large return compared to its capital. This large return attracts competition; generally speaking, it is not likely to continue indefinitely.</li>\n<li>Graham mentions that companies with high intangibles might be less prone to competition and that small companies, in general, are likely to show a more rapid growth rate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"significance-of-current-asset-value\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#significance-of-current-asset-value\" aria-label=\"significance of current asset value permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>significance of current asset value</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Graham examines the following ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the current asset value is generally a rough index of liquidating value</li>\n<li>a large number of common stocks sell for less than their current asset value and therefore sell below the amount realizable in liquidation</li>\n<li>the phenomenon of many stocks selling persistently below their liquidating value is fundamentally illogical. It means that a severe error is being committed, either: (a) in the judgement of the stock market, (b) in the company’s management policies, or (c) in the stockholders’ attitude toward their property</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>liquidating value</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the liquidating value of an enterprise is the money the owners would receive, in theory, if they sold all assets and paid off all debt in the company. They might sell all or part of it to someone else or turn the various assets into cash. Such liquidations are an everyday occurrence in private businesses but not for public companies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>realizable value of assets varies with their character</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>in reality, a company’s balance sheet does not provide exact information about liquidation value, but it does supply valuable clues and hints. The first rule is that liabilities are real, but the value of the assets must be questioned. All liabilities shown on the books must be deducted at their face amount. The value of the assets, however, must vary according to the character. Cash, for instance, is worth the carrying value, while inventory might only be worth 50-75% compared to the market price.</li>\n<li><em>object of this calculation</em>: applying a general rule of thumb for a real-life company, it can be seen that the stock was undervalued as it sold for less than the company’s cash holding - even after deducting all liabilities. <strong>The aim of using current asset value as a liquidation measure is not to find the exact liquidation number but to establish a rough estimate.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>prevalence of stocks selling below liquidating value</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>at some time in 1932, over 40% of all industrial companies listed on the NYSE were quoted at less than their net current assets. Also, at that time, a considerable number sold for less than their cash asset value. That means that the owner would profit more by shutting the company down than by selling equity on a going concern basis.</li>\n<li>one reason for the very low valuation is the high emphasis on the income statement. A company with no current earnings will be considered highly negative by the stock market. The seller might not know she was disposing of their interest in the company below liquidation value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>local significance of this phenomenon</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>when a common stock sells persistently below its liquidating value, either the price is too low, or the company should be liquidated.</li>\n<li>2 corollaries may be deducted from this principle:\n<ul>\n<li>although the low price offers an attractive opportunity to buy, such a price should incite the stockholders to question whether it is in their interest to continue the business</li>\n<li>such a price should incite the management to take all proper steps to correct the obvious disparity between market quotation and intrinsic value, including a reconsideration of its policies and frank justification to the stockholders of its decision to continue the business.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>there is a range of potential developments which may result in establishing a higher market price:\n<ul>\n<li>the creation of earning power that moves in lock-step with the company’s assets (for instance, from a general improvement in the industry or a change in the company’s operating policies)\n<ul>\n<li><em>general improvement in the industry</em>: when the textile business improved, the share of Pepperell increased more than eightfold in just two years</li>\n<li><em>changes in operating policies</em>: new lines of products, new sales methods, and reorganizing phases of production</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>a sale or merger, because some other concern can utilize the resources to better advantage and hence can pay at least liquidating value for the assets.\n<ul>\n<li>the white motor company suffered heavy losses and sold at a lower price than the liquidation value. An acquiring company found the big cash holding interesting, and the sales price was based on the current asset value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>complete or partial liquidation\n<ul>\n<li><em>complete liquidation</em>: The investors of mohawk mining company received 2.5 times the cost of shares when it was decided to liquidate the company altogether. The liquidation value proved identical to the current asset value and could be directly derived from the balance sheet.</li>\n<li><em>partial liquidation</em>: sometimes, an effective higher market value can be created by partially liquidating parts of the business and distributing that wealth out to the shareholders.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>discrimination required in selecting such issues</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>there is no doubt that stocks selling well below their liquidation value provide undervalued securities - and consequently profitable opportunities for purchase. Regardless, the securities analyst should exercise as much discrimination when selecting between the prospects.</li>\n<li>She can lean toward the five developments above (changes in operating policies, liquidation, etc…) if it is deemed that they may occur. Also, he can look at satisfactory current earnings and dividends or a high average earning power in the past. The analyst will avoid companies that are losing current assets rapidly and showing no sign of fixing the problem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>bargain of this type</strong>: common stocks that (1) are selling below their liquid asset value, (2) are apparently in no danger of dissipating these assets, and (3) have formerly shown a large earning power on the market price, may be said to belong to a class of investment bargains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>common stock representing the entire business cannot be less safe than a bond having a claim to only a part thereof</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the argument was that the company would have to pay coupon payments to the bond holders, while the dividend payments were unsecure. Here, Wall Street confuses the temporary consistency of income with the safety principle. Dividends paid out to stockholders would not make the stock any safer. What is happening is that the stockholders turn over their property. A rational stock owner would not surrender complete ownership for a limited claim and 5-6% returns on the investment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"balance-sheet-analysis-conclusions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#balance-sheet-analysis-conclusions\" aria-label=\"balance sheet analysis conclusions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>balance sheet analysis conclusions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>the common purpose of balance sheet analysis is not to find bargain investments but to detect financial weaknesses.</li>\n<li><strong>working-capital position and debt maturities</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>basic rules concerning working capital:</strong> for the working-capital ratio, a minimum of $2 of current assets for $1 current liabilities was formerly a standard for industrial companies.\n<ul>\n<li>the second measure of financial strength is the “acid test,” which requires that current assets - exclusive of inventories - should be at least equal to the current liabilities.

It was not seen as an independent instrument or an important part of capitalization. Today, opinions are reversed, and it has even become a popular medium for speculators.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a (detachable) option warrant is a transferable right to buy stock. The right can be described in detail by the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) the kind of stock, (2) the amount, (3) the price, (4) the method of payment, (5) the duration of the privilege, and (6) anti-dilution provisions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the type of stock covered by the privilege. Nearly all option warrants can be converted to common stock for the issuing company. Very few have rights that apply to preferred shares. Warrants have no right to receive interest, dividends or payments on account of principal, nor do they have the right to cash any vote.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>resemblance to subscription “right”</strong>: warrants are in many ways similar to the subscription rights issued by the corporation to stockholders in connection with the sale of additional stock. Differences occur, however, in terms of the exercised price and the period. Subscription rights will typically always be exercised unless the stock price drops substantially, and it will generally happen within the 60 days that the rights typically run. Warrants, on the other hand, are seldom exercised in such a short period, as the stock purchase price is typically set higher than the current stock price at the time of issue. The duration is most often longer than a year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>method of payment</strong>. Most option warrants require payment of the subscription price in cash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>basis of trading in warrants</strong>: option warrants are bought and sold in the market similarly to common stocks. The standard rule of a warrant is the right to buy one share of the stock.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>examples of warrants issued for various purposes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>attached to senior securities</li>\n<li>as compensation to underwriters.</li>\n<li>as compensation to promoters and management</li>\n<li>issued in a merger or reorganization plan in exchange for other securities</li>\n<li>attached to an original issue of common stock</li>\n<li>sold separately for cash.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>warrants as a vehicle of speculation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>qualitative element</em>: Since a warrant’s value will only materialize from an increase in earnings, the prospects of increased earnings would make the warrant more attractive than its stability, characterized as low-priced common stocks with speculative elements.</li>\n<li><em>quantitative considerations: the importance of low price</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham feels that an option warrant has speculative attractiveness only if it possesses all three desirable qualities: low price, long duration, and option price close to the market.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>a substantial part of an enterprise’s profits are distributed to operating managers, which is done without full disclosure. Stock options warrants have proven to be an excellent instrument for that purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>dangerous device for diluting stock values.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>as warrants give rights to buy the stock at a given price level when that price level is reached, earnings will be diluted for the common stockholder because they still must account for the cost to acquire the warrant</li>\n<li>the original issue of common stock carrying warrants to buy additional stock does not give stockholders anything more than they would have without the warrant.

While Graham argues the practicality of such a procedure is low and, under the Great Depression, would have made heavy demands upon human fortitude, he still finds the idea appealing.

These stocks generally fall into two classes:\n<ul>\n<li>those showing high current and average earnings about market price</li>\n<li>those making a reasonably satisfactory exhibit of earnings and selling at a low price to the net-current asset value. These companies will most often not be large and well known.</li>\n<li>the main drawback of a small company is its vulnerability to loss of earning power. Larger companies will be less prone to this.

If interest in the issue is legitimate and speculative, the price will respond extremely.</li>\n<li><em>relationship of the analyst to such situations</em> when the general market appears dangerously overvalued to the analyst, he must exercise caution when it comes to unfamiliar common stocks. The same applies when stocks appear to be bargains.

Instead, there is reason to believe that the personal element in corporate management often stands in the way of advantageous consolidations. In light of this fact, it is surprising that the stock market tends to react positively to mergers and acquisitions in the short run.</li>\n<li><em>litigation:</em> a lawsuit of any significance is highly disliked by the stock market, often to the extent that it is out of proportion to the impact of the case in question.

Cases of reorganization and other situations where liquidation or sale to outside interest ultimately result in cash distributions that can produce attractive analytical opportunities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>price patterns produced by insolvency</strong> certain price patterns tend to occur, especially if the receivership takes a long time. First, there is a tendency for the stock issue to sell too high, not only toward the bond issue but also toward their estimated value.

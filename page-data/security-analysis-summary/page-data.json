One type of market analysis, called technical analysis, refers only to past market values to predict future values. The second type of analysis refers to indices of economic activity outside the market that, presumably, have some influence over security prices. Neither of these kinds of market analysis has proven effective, and both essentially promote speculation over reasoned, fact-based investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intrinsic value is an important concept for security analysis. However, “intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms, it is understood to be that value justified by the facts…the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct…from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excess.” Although investors cannot calculate an exact intrinsic value for a given security because so many variables are involved, a careful examination can determine whether the price the market quotes is appropriate. Securities that meet stringent safety tests and appear to be selling well below their intrinsic value can often be profitable investments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Securities traditionally fall into two categories: stocks and bonds. This classification is inadequate because it pays more attention to the form of security than to its safety and purpose. The various types of securities may be more accurately classified into three groups, each of which has its criteria for what constitutes a sound investment: fixed-value securities, including high-grade bonds and preferred stocks; variable-value senior securities, including speculative bonds and preferred stocks; and common stocks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"criteria-for-investing-in-fixed-value-securities\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#criteria-for-investing-in-fixed-value-securities\" aria-label=\"criteria for investing in fixed value securities permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Criteria for Investing in Fixed-Value Securities</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bonds are not automatically safe investments because of their form. Instead, the soundness of a bond investment derives from the issuer’s ability to pay, which is, in turn, based on its financial strength. Therefore, the investor considering purchasing a bond should ask the following questions: Is the value of the company’s business more than its debts? Can the company meet its financial obligations even in the worst-case scenario, such as a recession or depression?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although no company or industry is depression-proof, two factors contribute to a company’s resilience in hard times: dominant size within its industry and sufficient earnings to cover its bond interest by a large margin. Bonds of companies that do not meet these requirements are not considered investment grade, even if the yield is highly attractive. A high yield cannot compensate for failure to pay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preferred stocks combine the limited return of bonds with the instability of common stocks. Despite these unattractive features, preferred stocks can be safe investments if they meet the same safety requirements as a bond, and their margin of safety is large enough that management is unlikely to suspend preferred dividends. The stability of the company exceeds that required for a bond investment. These stringent requirements limit the number of investment-grade preferred stocks to a very select group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Income bonds, also called adjustment bonds, should be subject to the same strict investment criteria as preferred stocks. Guaranteed issues occupy a position between bond debt and preferred stocks. Prospective investors must carefully examine the terms of the guarantee and evaluate the guarantor’s financial strength. Even with fixed-value investments, investors should periodically evaluate their holdings. There is no such thing as a permanent investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although many bonds and preferred stocks do not meet the requirements that would qualify them as investment grade, some issues in this category may be worth purchasing because they are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Investors must avoid issues that are selling at a discount for other reasons – for example, because the company is financially unsound.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"principles-for-selection-of-fixed-value-investments\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principles-for-selection-of-fixed-value-investments\" aria-label=\"principles for selection of fixed value investments permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principles for selection of fixed-value investments</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>avoid compromising the assumed risk for an increased reward to minimize the loss of principal\n<ul>\n<li>if risk is assumed, it should be in the form of paying a cheaper price (therefore lowering the principal required to acquire the security), instead of accepting a higher coupon or dividend.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"safety-not-measured-by-lien-but-by-ability-to-pay\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#safety-not-measured-by-lien-but-by-ability-to-pay\" aria-label=\"safety not measured by lien but by ability to pay permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>safety not measured by Lien but by ability to pay</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>safety is measured by the ability of the issuer to meet obligations - not by contractual rights</li>\n<li>in theory, if a business fails, the bond holder recovers his money from assets; but that often fails because:\n<ul>\n<li>property values shrink when the business fails</li>\n<li>there is difficulty in establishing legal rights</li>\n<li>there are inherent delays in receivership</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>to avoid trouble is better seeking protection after it occurs</li>\n<li>debt should bed assessed from the cashflow statement\n<ul>\n<li>“good” debt is when company is using financed capital for an opportunity or expansion that might require a quick entry to the market</li>\n<li>“bad” debt is when the business is required to borrow in order to sustain operations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"obligation-possibility-should-be-assessed-in-terms-of-depression-not-prosperity\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#obligation-possibility-should-be-assessed-in-terms-of-depression-not-prosperity\" aria-label=\"obligation possibility should be assessed in terms of depression not prosperity permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>obligation possibility should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>bonds should be bought on their ability to withstand a depression or recession; relative safety is found in companies of a) dominant size, and b) substantial margin or earnings over bond interests.</li>\n<li>presumption of safety based upon either the character of the industry or the mount of protection</li>\n<li>investor should look for industries least likely to be affected by a depression.</li>\n<li>investment practice recognizes importance of character of the industry. <strong>historically some industries and public utilities have been more stable than others, and equally their degree of stability has altered with time</strong>.

For example, during a bull market, market prices are higher but the total debt of a bond is fixed. Therefore a ratio of 2:1 should potentially be increased to 3:1 during growing market prices.

Prior to the failure, the parent company had a subsidiary that was paying a preferred share dividend. After the failure, the dividend was immediately discontinued. The event left the bond holder (debenture holder) of the parent company empty handed. The example demonstrates an importance for thoroughly understanding the prioritization of this structure and an importance for having a backed security.\n<ul>\n<li>subsidiaries’ bond interest</li>\n<li>subsidiaries’ preferred dividends</li>\n<li>parent company’s bond interest.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>minority interest in common stock of subsidiaries.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the earnings of minority stock are usually deducted in the income statement after the parent company’s bond interest, therefore, it does not reduce the margin of safety calculation.

These leases hold considerable fixed expenses on the company and ultimately impact the health of the bonds the company has issued.</li>\n<li>after identifying this concern, Graham recommends a rule of thumb for multiplying the fixed charges on the income statement by 22. This would provide capitalization of 4.5% on all the fixed charges. This was determined by taking the inverse of 22. It’s important to note that interest rates for railroad debts during 1938 were 4.5%. Therefore, this technique could be applied to any industry where fixed charges have numerous variables.</li>\n<li>it would be important to adjust the capitalization rate based on the average rates for bonds in that industry.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>the working-capital factor in the analysis of industrial bonds</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>it’s important that a company has excess current assets compared to current liabilities.

When evaluating privileged issues, consider the amount of the profit-sharing benefits per dollar invested, the proximity of the event that will trigger profit-sharing advantages and the duration of the privileges.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"criteria-for-investing-in-common-stocks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#criteria-for-investing-in-common-stocks\" aria-label=\"criteria for investing in common stocks permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Criteria for Investing in Common Stocks</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Common stocks, as a class, are much more speculative than senior issues. Yet they are important to the US financial system, and novice and expert investors alike eagerly follow their prices, so security analysts know how to deal with them. The false belief that common stocks were a good buy at any price – as long as the company’s earning trend was positive – partly fueled the crash of 1929. Clearly the practice of making common-stock investments safer deserves further analysis, because the possibility of significant price appreciation will always lure investors to this type of security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although the instability of common stock prices makes any given organization a dubious investment, portfolio diversification can offset this risk to some extent.

Dividends</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Before investing in a common stock, investigate both the firm’s dividend rate and its history of paying dividends. The dividend rate is important, because a dollar of surplus earnings is worth more to the investor when the company chooses to pay it as a dividend instead of reinvesting it in the business. Generally, companies that pay higher dividends have higher stock prices. However, management can suspend common-stock dividends at any time, so it is important to view the company’s dividend history as an indication, but not a guarantee, of future income.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extraordinary stock dividends</strong> (stock splits), on the other hand, are largely illusory, because they give investors nothing they did not already own. An improvement on this practice is for companies to pay periodic stock dividends, representing a return to the shareholders of surplus earnings reinvested in the business.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>although stock dividends and stock splits create no real value for the holders, much speculation about the value of the companies after the division is likely to occur due to the cheaper price.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>periodic stock dividends</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>with a periodic stock dividend, the shareholder often receives a smller and reasonable stock dividend that adds value over time.</li>\n<li>company should not provide a periodic stock dividend if the amount exceeds the funds being retained in earnings. The dividend could eventually exceeded the company’s ability to retain earnings power and the EPS slowly declined over a 10 year period, along with the market price.</li>\n<li>Graham suggests the dividend should be dispersed as a preferred share.\n<ul>\n<li>it doesn’t weaken the capital structure of the business like the common stock dividend.</li>\n<li>allows the company to retain earnings until a safe and manageable surplus is realized.</li>\n<li>this technique gives management flexibility and control to pay the dividend as long as they choose.</li>\n<li>once the retained earnings have been distributed, the obligation is no longer on the books once the preferred share is repurchased by the company.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Graham suggests that the market price of common stocks will perform similarly if management pays a healthy and sustainable dividend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>established principle of withholding dividends</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham claims that 2 companies with the same general business model and the same earnings will trade at different prices if the dividend policy is different. The market will value the company with the higher dividend more favorably.</li>\n<li>should a company pay a lower dividend in order to create stability for the owner with an assured payment, or should they pay a higher dividend and meet its obligation irregularly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>the merits of “plowing back” earnings</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>there’re 2 reasons retained earnings is beneficial to the stock holder.\n<ul>\n<li>whatever good for the company was good for the shareholder.</li>\n<li>company that retained earnings had more agility to remain competitive in difficult markets.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>if a company sustains a favorable ROE over a long period of time, it means the management is properly investing the retained earnings and adding value to the shareholder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>dividend policies arbitrary and sometimes selfishly determined</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham suggests that many board members are executives and friends of executives with very large portion of shares. As a result, they might want to minimize their personal tax burden by receiving smaller dividends from the company.</li>\n<li>leadership may seek a larger and more impressive sized business, therefore, using retained earnings to full fill their pursuit of an ever growing business (which may or may not add more earnings)</li>\n<li>management may seek the opportunity to purchase outstanding shares at lower prices with the retained earnings.</li>\n<li>a management that pays a small dividend is able to pay excessive salaries to executives and top level employees.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>arbitrary control of dividend policy complicates analysis of common stocks</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>suggested principle for dividend payments</strong>: Graham holds the strong opinion that a company should pay a large portion of their earnings to the shareholders. He says it’s more important for the shareholder to receive non-standard (or inconsistent) dividend rates at a higher return, instead of a lower and more consistent dividend, which likely results in the company accumulating reserves that add little value.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2-earnings\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-earnings\" aria-label=\"2 earnings permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Earnings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze earnings, carefully study the company’s income statement. While earnings are undoubtedly important, security analysts have accorded them too much weight in calculating a company’s investment soundness. Management can manipulate a company’s earnings many ways. Therefore, always examine the firm’s income statement with a critical eye. For example, businesses can engineer nonrecurring charges and profits to produce a favorable earnings trend. A firm’s accountants also can generate perceived earnings by lowering or increasing the company’s reserves, or by reporting subsidiaries’ results in different ways. Companies can also present depreciation and amortization costs in a misleading manner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Investors must pay attention to more than current earnings. They should consider both the earnings trend and the long-term earnings average – preferably seven to ten years, putting more weight on the latter number. The analyst’s job is not predicting the future of a trend or intuiting possible price changes; it is making decisions based on facts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>analyst should combine the information from the balance sheet and income statement to garner the best valuation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>disadvantages of sole emphasis on earning power</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>earnings statement has more variability than the balance sheet and therefore changes the value of the business making it appear unstable, the income statement can be more misleading than the balance sheet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>simplified statement of Wall Street’s Method of appraising common stocks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>price = Current Earnings Per Share (EPS) x Quality Coefficient</li>\n<li>how does quality coefficient is determined?\n<ul>\n<li>probably by whole host of factors such as dividend rate, history, size and reputation of the business.

This illustrates the most vicious type of accounting manipulation: taking sums out of surplus, and then reporting these same sums as income in the following years. The danger of this accounting method is the public is not likely to recognize it, and even the expert analyst might have a hard time detecting it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>reserves for inventory loss</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>companies continuously set aside reserves to absorb losses on inventory before they occur. The implication is that the income statement does not always reflect inventory losses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>other elements in inventory accounting</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>the standard procedure is to take inventory at the close of the year measured by the lowest of either cost price or market price.</li>\n<li>last-in, first-out: measure the actual amount paid for the most recently acquired inventory. The theory behind this method is that a merchant’s selling price is related mainly to the current replacement price or the recent cost of the article sold. This method may be useful to reduce income tax, if there is inventory fluctuation.</li>\n<li>the normal stock or basic-stock inventory method: a more radical method of minimizing fluctuations is the company must possess a certain physical stock of materials from year to year. This “permanent stock” would therefore keep the same value and not be imposed to any changes in price. In order to permit the base inventory to be carried at an unchanging figure on the balance sheet, the practice is to mark it down to a very low unit price, so low that it should never be necessary to reduce it further.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>idle-plant expense</strong>: the cost of carrying non-operating properties is almost always charged against income, Graham suggests it should not. By doing so, it’s misleading to the expenses of the company’s core product or service. The analyst may properly consider idle-plant expense as belonging to a somewhat different from ordinary charges against operating income, as these expenses by nature are not part of the company’s normal operations.\n<ul>\n<li>in theory, these expenses should be temporary since the management can terminate these losses at any time by disposing of the property. therefore, if the company chose to spend the money, Graham does not deem it logical to consider these assets equivalent to a permanent liability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>deferred charges</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>a business sometimes incurs expenses which are applicable to a number of years rather than a single 12-month period such as:\n<ul>\n<li>organization expense (legal fees, etc…)</li>\n<li>moving expenses</li>\n<li>development expenses (for new products, processes, for opening up a mine, etc…)</li>\n<li>discount on obligations sold</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the company is allowed to spread these types of costs over an appropriate period of years (5 years is a customary period of time).

This is done to benefit from the higher valuation in their balance sheet, without accepting the burden of consequently higher depreciation charges against net income.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the vast majority of industrial companies follow the standard policy or charing an appropriate depreciation rate against each class of depreciable assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when the analyst knows that a company’s depreciation policy differs from the standard, there is special reason to check the adequacy of the allowance. Comparison with a company in the same field may yield significant differences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>depreciation charges often an issue in mergers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>concealed depreciation such as understate depreciation, hence overstating the earnings power.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>amortization charges of oil and mining companies</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>depletion charges of mining companies</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>depletion represents the using up of capital assets by turning them into products for sale. It applies to companies producing metals, oil and gas, sulphur, timber, etc… As the holdings, or reserves, of these products are gradually exhausted, their value must gradually be written-off through charges against earnings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>independent calculation by investor necessary</strong>: in mining, the investor must ordinarily compute his own depletion allowances for his share of the mining property.</li>\n<li><strong>depletion and similar charges in the oil industry:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>in the oil industry depletion charges are closer related to the actual cost of doing business. Large oil producer normally spends substantial sums of capital each year on new leases and new wells. This is needed to make up for the shrinkage of reserves throughout continued production. In general, depletion charges are cash outlays for the purpose of maintaining reserves and production.</li>\n<li>Graham then provides an assessment of how some oil companies would misrepresent the actual life time of the asset by extending or shortening the depletion and depreciation of their assets. This was typically exercised so the company could control the market price through earnings manipulation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>the meaning of these variations to the analyst and the investor</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>analyst should seek to apply a uniform and reasonably conservative rate of amortization that reflects realities of fixed assets.\n<ul>\n<li>depreciation on tangible assets.

A loss on property should be charged against the year’s earnings, rather than gainst surplus.</li>\n<li>depletion of oil reserves. The proper principle here is that the analyst should allow for depletion based on the current market values of the oil.\n<ul>\n<li>in the case of integrated oil companies, accept the company’s depletion figure as the best available.</li>\n<li>in the case of companies that are solely or virtually oil producers, the analyst can compute what the market is paying for the total developed oil reserves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>other types of amortization of capital assets</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>leaseholds and leasehold improvements</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>if a lessee is renting a property at the large discount to the actual cost of owing the property - and the terms of the contract are over a long period of time - there maybe significant value to account for.</li>\n<li>oil lands are leased on a standard royalty basis, usually one-eighth of the production. Such leaseholds can be worth much more than the rental payments involved. If a company has paid money for a given leasehold, the cost is regarded as a capital investment that should be written off during the life of the lease. These charges are in reality part of the rent paid for the property, and must therefore be included in the current operating expense.</li>\n<li>when leased property is improved with assets fixed by the leese, the cost must be written down to nothing during the life of the lease. This is due to the landlord ultimately owning the property and the tethered asset when the lease expires. The annual expense for this purpose is called “amortization of leasehold improvements.” Chain-store enterprises, and consequently the annual write-offs may be of significant importance in their income statements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>amortization of patent</strong>: in theory, a patent should be dealt with the same way as a mining property; i.e, its cost to the investor should be written off against earnings during its remaining life.</li>\n<li><strong>amortization of goodwill</strong>: in modern accounting. Goodwill is continually tested for impairment, but isn’t amortized.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"public-utility-depreciation-policies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#public-utility-depreciation-policies\" aria-label=\"public utility depreciation policies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>public utility depreciation policies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>inadequate depreciation revealed by transfer from surplus and reserves such as in the case of Brooklyn Union Gas.</li>\n<li><strong>variety of depreciation policies</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Depreciation Proper</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Straight-line method</em>: each class of depreciable property is written down by equal annual charges during the period of its estimated life</li>\n<li><em>sinking-fund method</em>: the effect of this method is to make the deductions somewhat smaller in the earlier years and correspondingly higher in the later years. This is because depreciation is assumed to earn interest until the property is retired.</li>\n<li><em>the over-all method</em>: single annual percentage to the entire depreciable property account is used, instead of varying rates to different classes of assets. The object is to arrive at a simple approximation of the actual depreciation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>retirement reserve methods</em>\n<ul>\n<li>the intention of a retirement reserve is to have funds available when an asset retires. Over any long period of time, proper depreciation and proper retirement allowances should yield the same results. In reality the majority of retirement reserve policies operate simply to understate the current loss of property value and thus to overstate the earnings.</li>\n<li>various methods of calculating retirement reserves are:\n<ul>\n<li><em>percentage of gross</em>. this method would tend to approximate a regular depreciation rate if the percentage take were adequate. Generally this is not the case.</li>\n<li><em>fixed rate per unit of product</em>. This method resembles the previous and is subject to the same criticism. Instead of a percentage of gross product, an example used is $2.7 in depreciation for every thousand kilowatt hours sold.</li>\n<li><em>Over-all percentage of Gross for maintenance and depreciation combined</em>. By this method, the larger the amount spent for maintenance, the smaller the amount saved in a reserve for depreciation.</li>\n<li><em>discretionary deductions</em>. The annual deduction is largely based on the judgement of the management. It might be the same or varying amount from year to year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>double accounting policies on depreciation.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>regardless of what method is followed in the annual reports, practically every company follows the straight-line basis of depreciation in computing its income tax.

Graham presents 5 major reasons for accepting the income tax figure rather than the income statement as basis of depreciation:\n<ul>\n<li>the straight-line basis follows a definite and logical accounting theory. If there is an excessive deduction, the Treasure Department wont’ accept it.</li>\n<li>the inadequacy of the “retirement reserve” idea in general, has been shown by the necessity in many cases of making large transfers from surplus to support the retirement reserve.</li>\n<li>Since 1934, there has been an almost universal increase in the retirement allowances. This can be perceived as a strong indicator that past allowances were too small and therefore an overstatement of earnings.</li>\n<li>a number of state commissions and the federal commissions have now ordered companies within their jurisdictions to follow the income tax depreciation base.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>instance when income tax basis should be rejected or questioned.</em> while Graham in general believes in accepting income tax basis, there may be times when figures in the annual report should be accepted, or even to seek a third basis.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"amortization-charges-from-the-investors-viewpoint\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#amortization-charges-from-the-investors-viewpoint\" aria-label=\"amortization charges from the investors viewpoint permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>amortization charges from the investor’s viewpoint</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>problem indicated by hypothetical example</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>typical market appraisals\n<ul>\n<li>a company with a less valuable assets in terms of accounting is worth considerable more than the company with a higher value asset. This is done by a single gesture of writing down company C’s assets to almost nothing immediately upon the purchase.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>a more rational approach</em>. a more practical approach would be to include the fair value of the respective assets and add that to the cash holdings. The investor might consider which depreciation method that should be used.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>practical application of foregoing reasoning.</strong> depreciation is not a cash outlay but deducted as an expense on the income statement. As a result, the company is reporting no income, yet the cash account continues to grow because displayed income is being off-set by depreciation charges.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>how to determine the proper depreciation charge</em> the investor or the analyst must come up with an estimate for depreciation which aligns with the actual conditions of the business (based on the discoverable facts).</li>\n<li><em>concept of expended depreciation</em>. The primary reason for reducing a company’s depreciation charges is because it doesn’t properly reflect the company’s cash flow. In short, as an asset’s life continues to get older, the value that it is listed for on the company’s balance sheet will continue to decrease. As a result, an investor should see the value of tangible and intangible assets slowly decrease in value over time.</li>\n<li><em>long-term depreciation a form of obsolescence</em>. for instance a plant may not be wearing out, but rather being obsolete due to changes in the industry and the status of the corporation. This risk is rather due to the investment and not accounting, hence it should be incorporated in the price and not in the depreciation, as it is a business risk. Therefore, the carrying value of asset should be adjusted accordingly. This value test for asset impairment should be conducted quarterly by the company’s management.</li>\n<li><em>application of foregoing in determining earning power</em>. for companies that are similar to a railroad, only the expended depreciation should be deducted from earnings due to maintenance, renewals and repair to a large degree.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>depreciation on apartment and office buildings</strong>. In short, the asset can’t be depreciated for more than the price that was paid to acquire it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>inadequate allowance for depreciation</strong>. Assets should not be written down in large amounts early in the assets life simply to make the earnings-power appear more abundant during the assets final years of life. This represents the true cash flow of the business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>stock watering reversed</strong>. This manipulation of asset value by writing the book value up and down is interrelated with the value of the stock. This would inflate the stock prices by the higher book value of the fixed assets (known as <em>stock watering</em>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>the purchases’s amortization calculation</strong>. Where the life of a mining property is limited, the investor’s own calculation of amortization should be deducted from earnings.

This is the amount she must use for writing-off subsequent earnings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>general rule</em>. In reality no single calculation shown above will represent stocks wholistically. For big companies it is even harder since they have a bulk of patents and intangible items.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>special cases</em>. In some special cases, when a company’s business primarily consists of collecting royalties on a patent or a group of patents, some finite provisions can be made. This provision must be related to the price the investor paid for his interest in the patent, and not on the book value of the patent.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"significance-of-earnings-record\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#significance-of-earnings-record\" aria-label=\"significance of earnings record permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>significance of earnings record</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>concept of earning power</strong>: which basically the average earnings per share, should be seen over a number of years.

Asset Value</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To gauge asset value, inspect the business’s balance sheet. A firm’s book value per share equals the total value of its tangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. Wall Street has almost entirely superseded the importance of asset value with earnings. Although rules of thumb for the proper ratio of market price to book value vary, you still should investigate the underlying value of a business’s assets before investing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The current-asset value – that is, current assets minus liabilities – is perhaps a more important number. It excludes both intangible assets and fixed assets and is, therefore, a rough approximation of the value of the company should it go in to liquidation. As a general rule, if a firm’s market price is below its liquidation value, the company has either been undervalued or it should be liquidated. Investors who can distinguish between the undervalued issues and the ones performing poorly due to fundamental unsoundness can realize a significant upside.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In addition, examine the balance sheet to make sure that the company has an adequate cash position, that its current assets (exclusive of inventories) at least equal its current liabilities, and that it does not have a large amount of debt maturing soon, which could create refinancing problems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there should be no discount from the amount stated on the company’s books for cash and marketable securities, provided the securities are short term or marked to the market. The same holds true for property, plant, and equipment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>economic value of the assets is the reproduction costs of a new firm starting out in the same industry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we first find the current market prices for the securities. Then we must adjust the book value of the firm’s accounts receivable and inventory up or down to get a more realistic reproduction costs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>it is important to note that goodwill represents a prior blunder that must be ignored when calculating the intrinsic value of a company.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>liabilities and equity are the sources of funds that support the assets, which are the uses to which those funds are put</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there are 3 types of liabilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>those that arise from the normal conduct of the business</li>\n<li>those that arise from past circumstances that are not pertinent to a new entrant</li>\n<li>the outstanding formal debt of the company.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when we start with the reproduction cost of the assets and then subtract the first 2 categories of liabilities, we are left with the asset value of the whole enterprise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The defining character of a franchise is that it enables a firm to earn more than it needs to pay for the investments that fund its assets. The intrinsic value of a firm is either the reproduction costs of the assets, which should equal the EPV or those assets plus the competitive advantages of the firm that underlie its franchise.

It means that a serious error is being committed, either: (a) in the judgement of the stock market, (b) in the company’s management policies, or (c) in the stockholders’ attitude toward their property</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>liquidating value</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the liquidating value of an enterprise is the money the owners would receive, in theory, if they sold all assets and paid off all debt in the company. they might sell all or part of it to someone else, or they might turn the various kinds of assets into cash. Such liquidations are an everyday occurrence in the field of private business, but not for public companies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>realizable value of assets varies with their character</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>in reality, a company’s balance sheet does not provide exact information about liquidation value, but it does supply useful clues and hints. The first rule is that liabilities are real but the value of the assets must be questioned. This means that all true liabilities shown on the books must be deducted at their face amount. The value of the assets, however, must vary according to the character. Cash, for instance, is worth the carrying value, while inventory might only be worth 50-75% compared to the market price.</li>\n<li><em>object of this calculation</em>: applying a general rule of thumb for a real-life company, it can ben seen that the stock was undervalued as it sold for less than the company’s cash holding - even after deducting all liabilities. <strong>The aim of using current asset value as a liquidation measure is not to find the exact liquidation number, but to establish a rough estimate.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>prevalence of stocks selling below liquidating value</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>at some time in 1932, over 40% of all industrial companies listed on NYSE were quoted at less than their net current assets. Also at that time, a considerable number actually sold for less than their cash asset value. That actually means that the owner would profit more by shutting the company down than selling equity on a going concern basis.</li>\n<li>one reason for the very low valuation is the high emphasis put on the income statement. A company with no current earnings will be considered highly negative by the stock market. The seller might not know she were disposing their interest in the company below liquidation value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>local significance of this phenomenon</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>when a common stock sells persistently below its liquidating value, then either the price is too low or the company should be liquidated.</li>\n<li>2 corollaries may be deducted from this principle:\n<ul>\n<li>although, the low price offers an attractive opportunity to buy, such price should incite the stockholders to question whether it is in their interest to continue the business</li>\n<li>such a price should incite the management to take all proper steps to correct the obvious disparity between market quotation and intrinsic value, including a reconsideration of its own policies and frank justification to the stockholders of its decision to continue the business.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>there is a range of potential developments which may result in establishing a higher market price:\n<ul>\n<li>the creation of earning power that moves in lock-step with the company’s assets (for instance from a general improvement in the industry or a change in the company’s operating policies)\n<ul>\n<li><em>general improvement in the industry</em>: when the textile business improved the share of pepperell increased more than eightfold in just 2 years</li>\n<li><em>changes in operating policies</em>: new lines of products, new sales methods, and reorganizing phases of production</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>a sale or merger, because some other concern is able to utilize the resources to better advantage and hence can pay at least liquidating value for the assets.\n<ul>\n<li>white motor company was suffering heavy losses and was selling at a price lower than the liquidation value. The big cash holding was found interesting by an acquiring company, and the sales price was based on the current asset value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>complete or partial liquidation\n<ul>\n<li><em>complete liquidation</em>: investors of mohawk mining company received 2.5 times the cost of shares when it was decided to completely liquidate the company. THe liquidation value proved to be identical with the current asset value, and could be directly derived from balance sheet.</li>\n<li><em>partial liquidation</em>: sometimes an effective higher market value can be created by partially liquidating parts of the business and distributing that wealth out to the shareholders.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>discrimination required in selecting such issues</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>there is no doubt that stocks selling well below their liquidation value provides undervalued securities - and consequently profitable opportunities for purchase. Regardless, the securities analyst should exercise as much discrimination when selecting between the prospects.</li>\n<li>She can lean toward the five developments above (changes in operating policies, liquidation, etc…) if it is deemed that they may occur. Also, he can look at satisfactory current earnings and dividend, or a high average earning power in the past. The analyst will avoid companies that are losing current assets at a rapid rate and showing no sign of fixing the problem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>bargain of this type</strong>: common stocks that (1) are selling below their liquid asset value, (2) are apparently in no danger of dissipating these assets, and (3) have formerly shown a large earning power on the market price, may be said to belong to a class of investment bargains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>common stock representing the entire business cannot be less safe than a bond having a claim to only a part thereof</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the argument was that the company would have to pay coupon payments to the bond holders, while the dividend payments were unsecure. Here, Wall Street confuses the temporary consistency of income with the principle of safety. Dividends paid out to stockholders would not make the stock any safer. What is happening is that the stockholders turn over their own property. A rational stock owner would not surrender complete ownership for a limited claim and 5-6% returns on the investment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"balance-sheet-analysis-conclusions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#balance-sheet-analysis-conclusions\" aria-label=\"balance sheet analysis conclusions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>balance sheet analysis conclusions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>common purpose of balance sheet analysis is not to find bargain investments, but to detect financial weaknesses.</li>\n<li><strong>working-capital position and debt maturities</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>basic rules concerning working capital:</strong> for the working-capital ratio, a minimum of $2 of current assets for $1 current liabilities was formerly as a standard for industrial companies.\n<ul>\n<li>the second measure of financial strength is the “acid test”, which requires that current assets - exclusive of inventories - should be at least equal to the current liabilities.

It was not seen as an independent instrument and as an important part of the capitalization. Today, opinions are reversed, and it has even turned into a popular medium for speculators.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a (detachable) option warrant is a transferable right to buy stock. The right can be described in detail by the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) the kind of stock, (2) the amount, (3) the price, (4) the method of payment, (5) the duration of the privilege, and (6) anti dilution provisions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>type of stock covered by the privilege. Nearly all option warrants can be converted to common stock for the issuing company. Very few have rights that apply to preferred shares. Warrents have no right to receive interest, dividends or payments on account of principal, nor do they have the right to cash any vote.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>resemblance to subscription “right”</strong>: warrants are in many ways similar to the subscription rights issued by the corporation to stockholders in connection with the sale of additional stock. Differences occur, however, in terms of the exercised price and the time period. Subscription rights will typically always be exercised unless the stock price drops substantially, and it will generally happen within the 60 days that the rights typically run. Warrants, on the other hand, are seldom exercised in such a short period of time, as the stock purchase price is typically set higher than the current stock price at the time of issue. The duration is most often longer than a year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>method of payment</strong>. Most option warrants require payment of subscription price in cash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>basis of trading in warrants</strong>: option warrants are bought and sold in the market in the same way as common stocks. The standard rule of a warrant is the right to buy one share of the stock.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>examples of warrants issued for various purposes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>attached to senior securities</li>\n<li>as compensation to underwriters.</li>\n<li>as compensation to promoters and management</li>\n<li>issued in a merger or reorganization plan, in exchange for other securities</li>\n<li>attached to an original issue of common stock</li>\n<li>sold separately for cash.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>warrants as a vehicle of speculation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>qualitative element</em>: since the value of a warrant will only materialize from an increase in earnings, the prospects of increased earnings would make the warrant more attractive than its stability, characterized as low-priced common stocks with speculative element.</li>\n<li><em>quantitative considerations: importance of low price</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham feels that an option warrant has speculative attractiveness only if it possesses all 3 desirable qualities: low price, long duration, and option price close to the market.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>substantial part of an enterprise’s profits are distributed to operating managers, and that this is done without full disclosure. Stock option warrants have proven to be an excellent instrument for that purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>dangerous device for diluting stock values.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>as warrants give rights to buy stock at a given price level, when that pirce level is reached, earnings will be diluted for the common stockholder because they still must account for the cost to acquire the warrant</li>\n<li>the original issue of common stock carrying warrants to buy additional stock does not give stockholders anything more than they would have without the warrant. Further, it violates an obvious rule of sound corporate financing.

The counter argument is that successful smaller companies can multiply in size more impressively than those already on enormous size.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>market behavior of standard and nonstandard issues</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>standard or leading issues almost always respond rapidly to changes in their reported profits - they tend to exaggerate the significance of year-to-year fluctuations in earnings</li>\n<li>the action of less familiar issues depends largely upon the attitude of the professional market operators towards them. If there is interest in the issue, legitimate as well as speculative, the price will respond in an extreme fashion.</li>\n<li><em>relationship of the analyst to such situations</em> when the general market appears dangerously overvalued to the analyst, he must exercise caution when it comes to unfamiliar common stocks. The same applies when stocks appear to be bargains. A severe decline in the general market will affect all stock prices adversely, and the less familiar issues may prove especially vulnerable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>market exaggerations ue to factors other than changes in earnings</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>dividend changes</em> while there is no doubt that a dividend increase is a favorable development, a large increase in stock prices based solely on this is absurd.</li>\n<li><em>mergers and segregations</em>: studies into whether mergers and acquisitions aid in increasing earning power have in general indicated that no such effect can be found. Instead, there is reason to believe that the personal element in corporate management often stands in the way of advantageous consolidations. In light of this fact, it is surprising that the stock market tends to react so positively to mergers and acquisitions in the short run.</li>\n<li><em>litigation:</em> a lawsuit of any significance is highly disliked by the stock market, often to an extent that is out of proportion to the impact of the case in question. Developments of this kind may offer real opportunities to the analyst</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>price-value discrepancies in receivership</strong>: Graham argues that the analyst can invest in securities after such difficulties have arisen, because senior securities have been found to sell at too low prices. Cases of reorganization, and other situations where liquidation or sale to outside interest, ultimately result in a cash distributions that can produce attractive analytical opportunities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>price patterns produced by insolvency</strong> certain price patterns tend to occur, especially if the receivership tends to take a long time. First, there is a tendency for the stock issue to sell too high, not only toward the bond issue, but also to their estimated value. For bond issues, the price typically declines over time, reaching the lowest point just before a reorganization plan is ready to be announced.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>opportunities in railroad trusteeships</strong>: in the years following 1932 and the following year, a large part of the country’s railroad mileage fell into the hands of the trustee. This provided the shrewd investors with interesting opportunities as it put pressure on the price levels of securities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>vulnerability of unseasoned issues</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the earnings power is maintained, the unseasoned issue would also maintain the price, but even slight dissatisfactory development will lead to severe price decline.</li>\n<li><em>unseasoned industrial issues rarely deserve an investment rating</em>: unseasoned industrial issues should only be bought on an admittedly speculative basis. This requires in turn that the market price be low enough to permit a substantial rise, typically below 70.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>discrepancies in comparative prices</strong>: it is easier to determine whether issue A is better than issue B, than to determine whether issue A in its own right is a good investment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham gives 2 recommendations for selecting an issue to purchase (1) the issue to be bought is attractive in its own right or (2) there is a definite contractual relationship between the 2 issues in question</li>\n<li>for the first recommendation, a qualitative analysis must also be carried out, to evaluate the future earning power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>discrepancies due to special supply and demand factors</strong> this can be due to special and temporary factors. As an example, Graham mentiosn a high-grade railroad issue that became priced relatively differently due to a heavy volume sale of another series</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>united states savings bonds offer similar opportunity</strong> the disparity between US Government and corporate obligations has reappeared in recent years. In addition to their safety factor, there are also tax advantages, as well as the opportunity to liquidate in the market any any time, with no intermediate loss in the market, due to the spread.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"comparative-analysis-of-companies-in-the-same-field\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#comparative-analysis-of-companies-in-the-same-field\" aria-label=\"comparative analysis of companies in the same field permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>comparative analysis of companies in the same field</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>one fact that the analyst should be aware of when conducting his analysis is whether or not he is looking at a homogenous industry.

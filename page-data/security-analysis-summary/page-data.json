One type of market analysis, called technical analysis, refers only to past market values in order to predict future values. A second type of analysis refers to indices of economic activity outside the market that, presumably, have some influence over security prices. Neither of these kinds of market analysis has proven effective and both essentially promote speculation over reasoned, fact-based investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intrinsic value is an important concept for security analysis. However, “intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms, it is understood to be that value which is justified by the facts…the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct…from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excess.” Although investors cannot calculate an exact intrinsic value for a given security because so many variables are involved, careful examination can determine whether the price the market quotes is appropriate. Securities that meet stringent safety tests and appear to be selling well below their intrinsic value often can be profitable investments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Securities traditionally fall into two categories: stocks and bonds. This classification is inadequate, because it pays more attention to the form of the security than to its safety and purpose. The various types of securities may be more accurately classified into three groups, each of which has its own criteria for what constitutes a sound investment: fixed-value securities, including high-grade bonds and preferred stocks; variable-value senior securities, including speculative bonds and preferred stocks; and common stocks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"criteria-for-investing-in-fixed-value-securities\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#criteria-for-investing-in-fixed-value-securities\" aria-label=\"criteria for investing in fixed value securities permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Criteria for Investing in Fixed-Value Securities</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bonds are not automatically safe investments because of their form. Rather, the soundness of a bond investment derives from the issuer’s ability to pay, which is, in turn, based on its financial strength. Therefore, the investor who is considering purchasing a bond should ask the following questions: Is the value of the company’s business more than the value of its debts? Can the company meet its financial obligations even in the worst-case scenario, such as a recession or depression?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although no company or industry is depression-proof, two factors contribute to a company’s resilience in hard times: dominant size within its industry and sufficient earnings to cover its bond interest by a large margin. Bonds of companies that do not meet these requirements are not considered investment grade, even if the yield is highly attractive. A high yield cannot compensate for failure to pay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preferred stocks combine the limited return of bonds with the instability of common stocks. Despite these unattractive features, preferred stocks can be safe investments if they meet the same safety requirements as a bond, their margin of safety is large enough that management is unlikely to suspend preferred dividends, and the stability of the company exceeds that required for a bond investment. These stringent requirements limit the number of investment-grade preferred stocks to a very select group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Income bonds, also called adjustment bonds, should be subject to the same strict investment criteria as preferred stocks. Guaranteed issues occupy a position between bond debt and preferred stocks. Prospective investors must carefully examine the terms of the guarantee and evaluate the guarantor’s financial strength. Even with fixed-value investments, investors should periodically evaluate their holdings. There is no such thing as a permanent investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although many bonds and preferred stocks do not meet the requirements that would qualify them as investment grade, some issues in this category may nevertheless be worth purchasing, because they are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Investors must take care to avoid issues that are selling at a discount for other reasons – for example, because the company is financially unsound.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"principles-for-selection-of-fixed-value-investments\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principles-for-selection-of-fixed-value-investments\" aria-label=\"principles for selection of fixed value investments permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principles for selection of fixed-value investments</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>avoid compromising the assumed risk for an increased reward to minimize the loss of principal\n<ul>\n<li>if risk is assumed, it should be in the form of paying a cheaper price (therefore lowering the principal required to acquire the security), instead of accepting a higher coupon or dividend.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"safety-not-measured-by-lien-but-by-ability-to-pay\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#safety-not-measured-by-lien-but-by-ability-to-pay\" aria-label=\"safety not measured by lien but by ability to pay permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>safety not measured by Lien but by ability to pay</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>safety is measured by the ability of the issuer to meet obligations - not by contractual rights</li>\n<li>in theory, if a business fails, the bond holder recovers his money from assets; but that often fails because:\n<ul>\n<li>property values shrink when the business fails</li>\n<li>there is difficulty in establishing legal rights</li>\n<li>there are inherent delays in receivership</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>to avoid trouble is better seeking protection after it occurs</li>\n<li>debt should bed assessed from the cashflow statement\n<ul>\n<li>“good” debt is when company is using financed capital for an opportunity or expansion that might require a quick entry to the market</li>\n<li>“bad” debt is when the business is required to borrow in order to sustain operations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"obligation-possibility-should-be-assessed-in-terms-of-depression-not-prosperity\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#obligation-possibility-should-be-assessed-in-terms-of-depression-not-prosperity\" aria-label=\"obligation possibility should be assessed in terms of depression not prosperity permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>obligation possibility should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>bonds should be bought on their ability to withstand a depression or recession; relative safety is found in companies of a) dominant size, and b) substantial margin or earnings over bond interests.</li>\n<li>presumption of safety based upon either the character of the industry or the mount of protection</li>\n<li>investor should look for industries least likely to be affected by a depression.</li>\n<li>investment practice recognizes importance of character of the industry. <strong>historically some industries and public utilities have been more stable than others, and equally their degree of stability has altered with time</strong>.

Dividends</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Before investing in a common stock, investigate both the firm’s dividend rate and its history of paying dividends. The dividend rate is important, because a dollar of surplus earnings is worth more to the investor when the company chooses to pay it as a dividend instead of reinvesting it in the business. Generally, companies that pay higher dividends have higher stock prices. However, management can suspend common-stock dividends at any time, so it is important to view the company’s dividend history as an indication, but not a guarantee, of future income.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Extraordinary stock dividends (stock splits), on the other hand, are largely illusory, because they give investors nothing they did not already own. An improvement on this practice is for companies to pay periodic stock dividends, representing a return to the shareholders of surplus earnings reinvested in the business.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2-earnings\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-earnings\" aria-label=\"2 earnings permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Earnings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze earnings, carefully study the company’s income statement. While earnings are undoubtedly important, security analysts have accorded them too much weight in calculating a company’s investment soundness. Management can manipulate a company’s earnings many ways. Therefore, always examine the firm’s income statement with a critical eye. For example, businesses can engineer nonrecurring charges and profits to produce a favorable earnings trend. A firm’s accountants also can generate perceived earnings by lowering or increasing the company’s reserves, or by reporting subsidiaries’ results in different ways. Companies can also present depreciation and amortization costs in a misleading manner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Investors must pay attention to more than current earnings. They should consider both the earnings trend and the long-term earnings average – preferably seven to ten years, putting more weight on the latter number. The analyst’s job is not predicting the future of a trend or intuiting possible price changes; it is making decisions based on facts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"3-asset-value\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-asset-value\" aria-label=\"3 asset value permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. Asset Value</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To gauge asset value, inspect the business’s balance sheet. A firm’s book value per share equals the total value of its tangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. Wall Street has almost entirely superseded the importance of asset value with earnings. Although rules of thumb for the proper ratio of market price to book value vary, you still should investigate the underlying value of a business’s assets before investing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The current-asset value – that is, current assets minus liabilities – is perhaps a more important number. It excludes both intangible assets and fixed assets and is, therefore, a rough approximation of the value of the company should it go in to liquidation. As a general rule, if a firm’s market price is below its liquidation value, the company has either been undervalued or it should be liquidated. Investors who can distinguish between the undervalued issues and the ones performing poorly due to fundamental unsoundness can realize a significant upside.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In addition, examine the balance sheet to make sure that the company has an adequate cash position, that its current assets (exclusive of inventories) at least equal its current liabilities, and that it does not have a large amount of debt maturing soon, which could create refinancing problems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there should be no discount from the amount stated on the company’s books for cash and marketable securities, provided the securities are short term or marked to the market.

Most shareholders defer to the wisdom of management without demanding their rights as owners of the business. In the case of companies whose common stocks sell for less than the liquidating value, the shareholders may be best served by the liquidation of the company, but that would put management out of a job, so shareholders cannot depend on management to make the right decision. Investors need to educate themselves about management practices and take these lessons into account when making investments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remember, however, that “analysis connotes the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic. It is part of the scientific method. But in applying analysis to the field of securities, [you will] encounter the serious obstacle that investment is by nature not an exact science.” Still, professional analysis is “not only useful, but indispensable.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quotes</h1>\n<p>“There is very little altruism in finance.”</p>\n<p>“The typical American stockholder is the most docile and apathetic animal in captivity.

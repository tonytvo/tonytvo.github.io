One type of market analysis, called technical analysis, refers only to past market values in order to predict future values. A second type of analysis refers to indices of economic activity outside the market that, presumably, have some influence over security prices. Neither of these kinds of market analysis has proven effective and both essentially promote speculation over reasoned, fact-based investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intrinsic value is an important concept for security analysis. However, “intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms, it is understood to be that value which is justified by the facts…the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct…from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excess.” Although investors cannot calculate an exact intrinsic value for a given security because so many variables are involved, careful examination can determine whether the price the market quotes is appropriate. Securities that meet stringent safety tests and appear to be selling well below their intrinsic value often can be profitable investments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Securities traditionally fall into two categories: stocks and bonds. This classification is inadequate, because it pays more attention to the form of the security than to its safety and purpose. The various types of securities may be more accurately classified into three groups, each of which has its own criteria for what constitutes a sound investment: fixed-value securities, including high-grade bonds and preferred stocks; variable-value senior securities, including speculative bonds and preferred stocks; and common stocks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"criteria-for-investing-in-fixed-value-securities\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#criteria-for-investing-in-fixed-value-securities\" aria-label=\"criteria for investing in fixed value securities permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Criteria for Investing in Fixed-Value Securities</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bonds are not automatically safe investments because of their form. Rather, the soundness of a bond investment derives from the issuer’s ability to pay, which is, in turn, based on its financial strength. Therefore, the investor who is considering purchasing a bond should ask the following questions: Is the value of the company’s business more than the value of its debts? Can the company meet its financial obligations even in the worst-case scenario, such as a recession or depression?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although no company or industry is depression-proof, two factors contribute to a company’s resilience in hard times: dominant size within its industry and sufficient earnings to cover its bond interest by a large margin. Bonds of companies that do not meet these requirements are not considered investment grade, even if the yield is highly attractive. A high yield cannot compensate for failure to pay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preferred stocks combine the limited return of bonds with the instability of common stocks. Despite these unattractive features, preferred stocks can be safe investments if they meet the same safety requirements as a bond, their margin of safety is large enough that management is unlikely to suspend preferred dividends, and the stability of the company exceeds that required for a bond investment. These stringent requirements limit the number of investment-grade preferred stocks to a very select group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Income bonds, also called adjustment bonds, should be subject to the same strict investment criteria as preferred stocks. Guaranteed issues occupy a position between bond debt and preferred stocks. Prospective investors must carefully examine the terms of the guarantee and evaluate the guarantor’s financial strength. Even with fixed-value investments, investors should periodically evaluate their holdings. There is no such thing as a permanent investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although many bonds and preferred stocks do not meet the requirements that would qualify them as investment grade, some issues in this category may nevertheless be worth purchasing, because they are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Investors must take care to avoid issues that are selling at a discount for other reasons – for example, because the company is financially unsound.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"principles-for-selection-of-fixed-value-investments\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principles-for-selection-of-fixed-value-investments\" aria-label=\"principles for selection of fixed value investments permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principles for selection of fixed-value investments</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>avoid compromising the assumed risk for an increased reward to minimize the loss of principal\n<ul>\n<li>if risk is assumed, it should be in the form of paying a cheaper price (therefore lowering the principal required to acquire the security), instead of accepting a higher coupon or dividend.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"safety-not-measured-by-lien-but-by-ability-to-pay\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#safety-not-measured-by-lien-but-by-ability-to-pay\" aria-label=\"safety not measured by lien but by ability to pay permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>safety not measured by Lien but by ability to pay</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>safety is measured by the ability of the issuer to meet obligations - not by contractual rights</li>\n<li>in theory, if a business fails, the bond holder recovers his money from assets; but that often fails because:\n<ul>\n<li>property values shrink when the business fails</li>\n<li>there is difficulty in establishing legal rights</li>\n<li>there are inherent delays in receivership</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>to avoid trouble is better seeking protection after it occurs</li>\n<li>debt should bed assessed from the cashflow statement\n<ul>\n<li>“good” debt is when company is using financed capital for an opportunity or expansion that might require a quick entry to the market</li>\n<li>“bad” debt is when the business is required to borrow in order to sustain operations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"obligation-possibility-should-be-assessed-in-terms-of-depression-not-prosperity\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#obligation-possibility-should-be-assessed-in-terms-of-depression-not-prosperity\" aria-label=\"obligation possibility should be assessed in terms of depression not prosperity permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>obligation possibility should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>bonds should be bought on their ability to withstand a depression or recession; relative safety is found in companies of a) dominant size, and b) substantial margin or earnings over bond interests.</li>\n<li>presumption of safety based upon either the character of the industry or the mount of protection</li>\n<li>investor should look for industries least likely to be affected by a depression.</li>\n<li>investment practice recognizes importance of character of the industry. <strong>historically some industries and public utilities have been more stable than others, and equally their degree of stability has altered with time</strong>.

Dividends</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Before investing in a common stock, investigate both the firm’s dividend rate and its history of paying dividends. The dividend rate is important, because a dollar of surplus earnings is worth more to the investor when the company chooses to pay it as a dividend instead of reinvesting it in the business. Generally, companies that pay higher dividends have higher stock prices. However, management can suspend common-stock dividends at any time, so it is important to view the company’s dividend history as an indication, but not a guarantee, of future income.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extraordinary stock dividends</strong> (stock splits), on the other hand, are largely illusory, because they give investors nothing they did not already own. An improvement on this practice is for companies to pay periodic stock dividends, representing a return to the shareholders of surplus earnings reinvested in the business.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>although stock dividends and stock splits create no real value for the holders, much speculation about the value of the companies after the division is likely to occur due to the cheaper price.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>periodic stock dividends</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>with a periodic stock dividend, the shareholder often receives a smller and reasonable stock dividend that adds value over time.</li>\n<li>company should not provide a periodic stock dividend if the amount exceeds the funds being retained in earnings. The dividend could eventually exceeded the company’s ability to retain earnings power and the EPS slowly declined over a 10 year period, along with the market price.</li>\n<li>Graham suggests the dividend should be dispersed as a preferred share.\n<ul>\n<li>it doesn’t weaken the capital structure of the business like the common stock dividend.</li>\n<li>allows the company to retain earnings until a safe and manageable surplus is realized.</li>\n<li>this technique gives management flexibility and control to pay the dividend as long as they choose.</li>\n<li>once the retained earnings have been distributed, the obligation is no longer on the books once the preferred share is repurchased by the company.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Graham suggests that the market price of common stocks will perform similarly if management pays a healthy and sustainable dividend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>established principle of withholding dividends</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham claims that 2 companies with the same general business model and the same earnings will trade at different prices if the dividend policy is different. The market will value the company with the higher dividend more favorably.</li>\n<li>should a company pay a lower dividend in order to create stability for the owner with an assured payment, or should they pay a higher dividend and meet its obligation irregularly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>the merits of “plowing back” earnings</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>there’re 2 reasons retained earnings is beneficial to the stock holder.\n<ul>\n<li>whatever good for the company was good for the shareholder.</li>\n<li>company that retained earnings had more agility to remain competitive in difficult markets.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>if a company sustains a favorable ROE over a long period of time, it means the management is properly investing the retained earnings and adding value to the shareholder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>dividend policies arbitrary and sometimes selfishly determined</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham suggests that many board members are executives and friends of executives with very large portion of shares. As a result, they might want to minimize their personal tax burden by receiving smaller dividends from the company.</li>\n<li>leadership may seek a larger and more impressive sized business, therefore, using retained earnings to full fill their pursuit of an ever growing business (which may or may not add more earnings)</li>\n<li>management may seek the opportunity to purchase outstanding shares at lower prices with the retained earnings.</li>\n<li>a management that pays a small dividend is able to pay excessive salaries to executives and top level employees.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>arbitrary control of dividend policy complicates analysis of common stocks</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>suggested principle for dividend payments</strong>: Graham holds the strong opinion that a company should pay a large portion of their earnings to the shareholders. He says it’s more important for the shareholder to receive non-standard (or inconsistent) dividend rates at a higher return, instead of a lower and more consistent dividend, which likely results in the company accumulating reserves that add little value.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2-earnings\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-earnings\" aria-label=\"2 earnings permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Earnings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze earnings, carefully study the company’s income statement. While earnings are undoubtedly important, security analysts have accorded them too much weight in calculating a company’s investment soundness. Management can manipulate a company’s earnings many ways. Therefore, always examine the firm’s income statement with a critical eye. For example, businesses can engineer nonrecurring charges and profits to produce a favorable earnings trend. A firm’s accountants also can generate perceived earnings by lowering or increasing the company’s reserves, or by reporting subsidiaries’ results in different ways. Companies can also present depreciation and amortization costs in a misleading manner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Investors must pay attention to more than current earnings. They should consider both the earnings trend and the long-term earnings average – preferably seven to ten years, putting more weight on the latter number. The analyst’s job is not predicting the future of a trend or intuiting possible price changes; it is making decisions based on facts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>analyst should combine the information from the balance sheet and income statement to garner the best valuation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>disadvantages of sole emphasis on earning power</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>earnings statement has more variability than the balance sheet and therefore changes the value of the business making it appear unstable, the income statement can be more misleading than the balance sheet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>simplified statement of Wall Street’s Method of appraising common stocks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>price = Current Earnings Per Share (EPS) x Quality Coefficient</li>\n<li>how does quality coefficient is determined?\n<ul>\n<li>probably by whole host of factors such as dividend rate, history, size and reputation of the business. Graham suspects all these factors are dwarfed by the real factor, which is earnings trend.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>earnings not only fluctuate but are subject to arbitrary determination</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>some of the techniques management can use to misrepresent earnings in the short term are the following\n<ul>\n<li>through allocating items to surplus (on the balance sheet) instead of revenue</li>\n<li>through misrepresented amortization charges</li>\n<li>through an amendment of the capital structure</li>\n<li>through the use of large capital funds for items that don’t pertain to the business</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>significance of foregoing to the analyst</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the end, the analyst should be able to answer 3 questions:\n<ul>\n<li>what are the true earnings for the period studied?</li>\n<li>what indications does the earnings record carry as to the future earning power?</li>\n<li>what standards should be applied to the income statement to arrive at a reasonable valuation?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>criticism and restatement of the income account</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the analyst will need to pay close attention to the ambiguous way the account rules can be applied\n<ul>\n<li>non-recurrent profits and losses.

This illustrates the most vicious type of accounting manipulation: taking sums out of surplus, and then reporting these same sums as income in the following years. The danger of this accounting method is the public is not likely to recognize it, and even the expert analyst might have a hard time detecting it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>reserves for inventory loss</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>companies continuously set aside reserves to absorb losses on inventory before they occur. The implication is that the income statement does not always reflect inventory losses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>other elements in inventory accounting</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>the standard procedure is to take inventory at the close of the year measured by the lowest of either cost price or market price.</li>\n<li>last-in, first-out: measure the actual amount paid for the most recently acquired inventory. The theory behind this method is that a merchant’s selling price is related mainly to the current replacement price or the recent cost of the article sold. This method may be useful to reduce income tax, if there is inventory fluctuation.</li>\n<li>the normal stock or basic-stock inventory method: a more radical method of minimizing fluctuations is the company must possess a certain physical stock of materials from year to year. This “permanent stock” would therefore keep the same value and not be imposed to any changes in price. In order to permit the base inventory to be carried at an unchanging figure on the balance sheet, the practice is to mark it down to a very low unit price, so low that it should never be necessary to reduce it further.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>idle-plant expense</strong>: the cost of carrying non-operating properties is almost always charged against income, Graham suggests it should not. By doing so, it’s misleading to the expenses of the company’s core product or service. The analyst may properly consider idle-plant expense as belonging to a somewhat different from ordinary charges against operating income, as these expenses by nature are not part of the company’s normal operations.\n<ul>\n<li>in theory, these expenses should be temporary since the management can terminate these losses at any time by disposing of the property. therefore, if the company chose to spend the money, Graham does not deem it logical to consider these assets equivalent to a permanent liability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>deferred charges</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>a business sometimes incurs expenses which are applicable to a number of years rather than a single 12-month period such as:\n<ul>\n<li>organization expense (legal fees, etc…)</li>\n<li>moving expenses</li>\n<li>development expenses (for new products, processes, for opening up a mine, etc…)</li>\n<li>discount on obligations sold</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the company is allowed to spread these types of costs over an appropriate period of years (5 years is a customary period of time). It is entered upon balance sheets as a deferred charges, which is written off by annual charges against earnings.</li>\n<li>it is incorrect to write off these types of expenses in a single year, and against a ‘surplus’ as net income for coming years would be overstated, followed from the understated operating expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>amortization of bond discount</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>the discount should be amortized over the life of the bond by an annual charge against earnings.</li>\n<li>the write-offs could be written against surplus to eliminate future annual deductions from earnings, and in that way to make the shares appear more valuable.

This makes the analysts job very difficult to assess capital expenditures.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>depreciation base other than cost</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham suggests substitute the replacement value of all the fixed assets at a given date, while everything prior is depreciated according to current accounting standards.</li>\n<li>in most cases, companies don’t place much interest in ensuring their depreciation charges are representative of their assets’ ever-changing replacement costs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>mark-downs to reduce depreciation charges</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graham believes that excessive write-downs of fixed assets are inexcusable and should not be condoned by the accounting profession. Accountants should refuse to certify a report containing such mark-downs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>balance sheet-income account discrepancies</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>prevalent in the case of mining and oil companies, is to mark up fixed assets and then fail to increase the correspondingly depreciation charges on the income statement. This is done to benefit from the higher valuation in their balance sheet, without accepting the burden of consequently higher depreciation charges against net income.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the vast majority of industrial companies follow the standard policy or charing an appropriate depreciation rate against each class of depreciable assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when the analyst knows that a company’s depreciation policy differs from the standard, there is special reason to check the adequacy of the allowance. Comparison with a company in the same field may yield significant differences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>depreciation charges often an issue in mergers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>concealed depreciation such as understate depreciation, hence overstating the earnings power.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>amortization charges of oil and mining companies</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>depletion charges of mining companies</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>depletion represents the using up of capital assets by turning them into products for sale. It applies to companies producing metals, oil and gas, sulphur, timber, etc… As the holdings, or reserves, of these products are gradually exhausted, their value must gradually be written-off through charges against earnings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>independent calculation by investor necessary</strong>: in mining, the investor must ordinarily compute his own depletion allowances for his share of the mining property.</li>\n<li><strong>depletion and similar charges in the oil industry:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>in the oil industry depletion charges are closer related to the actual cost of doing business. Large oil producer normally spends substantial sums of capital each year on new leases and new wells. This is needed to make up for the shrinkage of reserves throughout continued production. In general, depletion charges are cash outlays for the purpose of maintaining reserves and production.</li>\n<li>Graham then provides an assessment of how some oil companies would misrepresent the actual life time of the asset by extending or shortening the depletion and depreciation of their assets. This was typically exercised so the company could control the market price through earnings manipulation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>the meaning of these variations to the analyst and the investor</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>analyst should seek to apply a uniform and reasonably conservative rate of amortization that reflects realities of fixed assets.\n<ul>\n<li>depreciation on tangible assets. This should always be applied to cost - or to a figure substantially less than cost.</li>\n<li>intangible drilling costs. Capitalizing these costs, and then writing them off as oil is produced, is the preferable basis for comparative purposes and to supply a fair reflection of current earnings.</li>\n<li>property retirement and abandoned leases. A loss on property should be charged against the year’s earnings, rather than gainst surplus.</li>\n<li>depletion of oil reserves. The proper principle here is that the analyst should allow for depletion based on the current market values of the oil.\n<ul>\n<li>in the case of integrated oil companies, accept the company’s depletion figure as the best available.</li>\n<li>in the case of companies that are solely or virtually oil producers, the analyst can compute what the market is paying for the total developed oil reserves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>other types of amortization of capital assets</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>leaseholds and leasehold improvements</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>if a lessee is renting a property at the large discount to the actual cost of owing the property - and the terms of the contract are over a long period of time - there maybe significant value to account for.</li>\n<li>oil lands are leased on a standard royalty basis, usually one-eighth of the production. Such leaseholds can be worth much more than the rental payments involved. If a company has paid money for a given leasehold, the cost is regarded as a capital investment that should be written off during the life of the lease. These charges are in reality part of the rent paid for the property, and must therefore be included in the current operating expense.</li>\n<li>when leased property is improved with assets fixed by the leese, the cost must be written down to nothing during the life of the lease. This is due to the landlord ultimately owning the property and the tethered asset when the lease expires. The annual expense for this purpose is called “amortization of leasehold improvements.” Chain-store enterprises, and consequently the annual write-offs may be of significant importance in their income statements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>amortization of patent</strong>: in theory, a patent should be dealt with the same way as a mining property; i.e, its cost to the investor should be written off against earnings during its remaining life.</li>\n<li><strong>amortization of goodwill</strong>: in modern accounting. Goodwill is continually tested for impairment, but isn’t amortized.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"public-utility-depreciation-policies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#public-utility-depreciation-policies\" aria-label=\"public utility depreciation policies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>public utility depreciation policies</h3>\n<h3 id=\"amortization-charges-from-the-investors-viewpoint\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#amortization-charges-from-the-investors-viewpoint\" aria-label=\"amortization charges from the investors viewpoint permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>amortization charges from the investor’s viewpoint</h3>\n<h3 id=\"significance-of-earnings\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#significance-of-earnings\" aria-label=\"significance of earnings permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>significance of earnings</h3>\n<h3 id=\"price-earnings-ratios-for-common-stocks-adjustments-for-changes-in-capitalization\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#price-earnings-ratios-for-common-stocks-adjustments-for-changes-in-capitalization\" aria-label=\"price earnings ratios for common stocks adjustments for changes in capitalization permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>price-earnings ratios for common stocks.

Asset Value</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To gauge asset value, inspect the business’s balance sheet. A firm’s book value per share equals the total value of its tangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. Wall Street has almost entirely superseded the importance of asset value with earnings. Although rules of thumb for the proper ratio of market price to book value vary, you still should investigate the underlying value of a business’s assets before investing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The current-asset value – that is, current assets minus liabilities – is perhaps a more important number. It excludes both intangible assets and fixed assets and is, therefore, a rough approximation of the value of the company should it go in to liquidation. As a general rule, if a firm’s market price is below its liquidation value, the company has either been undervalued or it should be liquidated. Investors who can distinguish between the undervalued issues and the ones performing poorly due to fundamental unsoundness can realize a significant upside.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In addition, examine the balance sheet to make sure that the company has an adequate cash position, that its current assets (exclusive of inventories) at least equal its current liabilities, and that it does not have a large amount of debt maturing soon, which could create refinancing problems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there should be no discount from the amount stated on the company’s books for cash and marketable securities, provided the securities are short term or marked to the market. The same holds true for property, plant, and equipment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>economic value of the assets is the reproduction costs of a new firm starting out in the same industry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we first find the current market prices for the securities.

Most shareholders defer to the wisdom of management without demanding their rights as owners of the business. In the case of companies whose common stocks sell for less than the liquidating value, the shareholders may be best served by the liquidation of the company, but that would put management out of a job, so shareholders cannot depend on management to make the right decision. Investors need to educate themselves about management practices and take these lessons into account when making investments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remember, however, that “analysis connotes the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic.

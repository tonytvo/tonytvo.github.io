It’s likely that lower levels of cortisol played a major role in this improvement. The Davis study participants had one simple task: Pause during the day to contemplate what they were grateful for. Lowering your cortisol is that easy.</li>\n<li>3 habits in the first 5 mins of the day (one of them is to write down what you’re grateful for)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stay positive.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. In these moments, think about your day, and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small. If you can’t think of something from the current day, reflect on the previous day or even the previous week. Or perhaps you’re looking forward to an exciting event that you can focus on. The point here is that you must have something positive that you’re ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative. Research from University College London found that negative thinkers have a significantly greater chance of developing dementia over just a four-year period.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Avoid asking, “What if?”</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“What if?” statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you’ll spend focusing on taking action that will calm you down and keep your stress under control. Calm people know that asking “What if?” will only take them to a place they don’t want or need to go. If you do find yourself having trouble letting go of a particular “What if?,” take a moment to consider your plan of action should it come to fruition and move on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Disconnect.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given the importance of keeping stress intermittent, it’s easy to see how taking regular time off the grid can help keep your stress under control. When you make yourself available to your work 24/7, you expose yourself to a constant barrage of stressors. Forcing yourself offline and even-gulp!-turning off your phone gives your body a break from a constant source of stress. Studies have shown that something as simple as an email break can lower stress levels.</li>\n<li>putting a mental recharge into your weekly schedule. If you’re worried about the negative repercussions of taking this step, first try doing it at times when you’re unlikely to be contacted-maybe Sunday morning. As you grow more comfortable with these breaks, and as your coworkers begin to accept that you spend time offline, gradually expand the amount of time you spend away from technology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Limit your caffeine intake.</strong> Drinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the “fight-or-flight” response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt email. When caffeine puts your brain and body into this hyper-aroused state of stress, your emotions outrun your behavior. The stress that caffeine creates is far from intermittent, as its long half-life ensures that it takes its sweet time working its way out of your body.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sleep.</strong> I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep for increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. Stressful projects often make you feel as if you have no time to sleep, but taking the time to get a decent night’s sleep is often the one thing keeping you from getting things under control. Many of us don’t know what appropriate sleep hygiene is or why we have such lousy sleep. The chapter on cleaning up your sleep hygiene will help</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>you make your sleep top notch. Reframe your perspective. Stress and worry are fueled by our own skewed perceptions of events. It’s easy to think that unrealistic deadlines, unforgiving bosses, and out-of-control traffic are the reasons you’re so stressed all the time. You can’t control your circumstances, but you can control how you respond to them. <strong>So, before you spend too much time dwelling on something, take a minute to put the situation into perspective.</strong>. If you’re thinking in broad, sweeping statements such as “Everything is going wrong” or “Nothing will work out,” then you need to reframe the situation. A great way to correct this unproductive thought pattern is to list specific things that are actually going wrong or not working out. Most likely, you will come up with only a few things (not everything), and the scope of these stressors will look much more limited than they initially appeared.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Breathe.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Practicing being in the moment with your breathing will train your brain to focus on the task at hand and get the stress monkey off your back. When you’re feeling stressed, take a couple of minutes to focus on your breathing. Close the door, put away all other distractions, and just sit in your chair and breathe. Your goal is to spend the entire time focused on your breathing, which will prevent your mind from wandering. Think about how it feels to breathe in and out. This sounds simple, but it’s hard to do it for more than a minute or two. It’s all right if you get sidetracked by another thought. This will happen at the beginning, and you just need to bring your focus back to your breathing. If you struggle to stay focused on your breathing, try counting each breath in and out until you get to 20, and then start again from 1. Don’t worry if you lose count. You can always just start over.</li>\n<li>Shallow breaths deprive your brain of oxygen. This leads to poor concentration, forgetfulness, mood swings, anxiety and lack of energy. Breathe slowly and deeply.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Say no.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research conducted at the University of California, Berkeley, showed that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you will experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Saying no is indeed a major challenge for many people. “No” is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it’s time to say no, avoid phrases such as “I don’t think I can” or “I’m not certain.” Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Neutralize toxic people.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dealing with difficult people is frustrating, exhausting, and highly stressful. You can control your interactions with toxic people by keeping your feelings in check. When you need to confront a toxic person, approach the situation rationally. Identify your emotions, and don’t allow anger or frustration to add to the chaos. In addition, consider the difficult person’s viewpoint and perspective so that you can find solutions and common ground. When things completely derail, take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting them bring you down. This is easier said than done, which is why there’s a separate chapter on techniques and habits for neutralizing toxic people.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t hold grudges.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The negative emotions that come with holding onto a grudge are actually a stress response. Just thinking about the event sends your body into fight-or-flight mode. When the threat is imminent, this reaction is essential to your survival, but when the threat is ancient history, holding onto that stress wreaks havoc on your body and can have devastating health consequences over time. In fact, researchers at Emory University have shown that holding onto stress contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease. Holding onto a grudge means you’re holding onto stress, and emotionally intelligent people know to avoid this at all costs. Letting go of a grudge not only makes you feel better now but can also improve your health.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Practice mindfulness.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mindfulness is a simple, research-supported form of meditation that helps you gain control of unruly thoughts and behaviors. People who practice mindfulness regularly are more focused, even when they are not meditating. It is an excellent technique to help reduce stress, because it helps you reduce the feeling of not being in control. Essentially, mindfulness helps you stop jumping from one thought to the next, which keeps you from ruminating on negative thoughts. Overall, it’s a great way to make it through your busy day calmly and productively. There’s a separate chapter on how to practice this technique.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"structuring-your-free-time-alleviates-stress\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#structuring-your-free-time-alleviates-stress\" aria-label=\"structuring your free time alleviates stress permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>STRUCTURING YOUR FREE TIME ALLEVIATES STRESS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A Stanford study found that productivity per hour declines sharply when a workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that there’s no point in working any more. That’s right. People who work as much as 70 hours (or more) per week actually get the same amount done as people who work 55 hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 1: Minimize chores.</strong> Chores tend to monopolize your free time. When this happens, you lose the opportunity to relax and reflect. What’s worse, doing a lot of chores feels like work, and if you spend all weekend doing them, you just put in a seven-day workweek. To keep this from happening, you need to schedule your chores like you would anything else during the week. If you don’t complete them during the allotted time, you move on and finish them the following weekend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 2: Exercise.</strong> No time to exercise during the week? You have 48 hours every weekend to make it happen. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a soothing neurotransmitter that reduces stress. Exercise is also a great way to come up with new ideas. Innovators and other successful people know that being outdoors often sparks creativity. I know that a lot of my best ideas come to me while I’m surfing. While you’re out in the ocean, the combination of invigorating activity and beautiful scenery creates the perfect environment to be creative. Whether you’re running, cycling, or gardening, exercise leads to endorphin-fueled introspection. The key is to find a physical activity that does this for you and then to make it an important part of your weekly routine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 3: Pursue a passion.</strong> You might be surprised what happens when you pursue something you’re passionate about during your time off. Indulging your passions is a great way to escape stress and open your mind to new ways of thinking. Things like playing music, reading, writing, painting, or even playing catch with your kids can help stimulate different modes of thought that can reap huge dividends over the coming week.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 4: Spend quality time with your family.</strong> Spending quality time with your family is essential if you want to recharge and relax. Weekdays are so hectic that the entire week can fly by with little quality family time. Don’t let this bleed into your weekends. Take your kids to the park, take your spouse to their favorite restaurant, and go visit your parents. You’ll be glad you did.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 5: Schedule micro-adventures.</strong> Buy tickets to a concert or play, or make reservations for that cool new hotel that just opened downtown. Instead of running on a treadmill, plan a hike. Try something you haven’t done before, or perhaps something you haven’t done in a long time. Studies have shown that anticipating something good is a significant part of what makes the activity pleasurable. Knowing that you have something interesting planned for Saturday will not only be fun come Saturday but will also significantly improve your mood throughout the week.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 6: Designate mornings as me time.</strong> Your mind achieves peak performance two to four hours after you wake up, so get up early to do something physical and invigorating, and then save the mental tasks for later in the morning when your mind is at its peak.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 7: Prepare for the upcoming week.</strong> The weekend is a great time to spend a few moments planning your upcoming week. As little as 30 minutes of planning can yield significant gains in productivity and reduced stress. The week feels a lot more manageable when you go into it with a plan, because all you have to focus on is execution. Weekly reflection is a powerful tool for improvement. Use the weekend to contemplate the larger forces that are shaping your industry, your organization, and your job. Without the distractions of Monday to Friday busy work, you should be able to see things in a whole new light. Use this insight to alter your approach to the coming week, which improves the efficiency and efficacy of your work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"make-your-goals-public\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#make-your-goals-public\" aria-label=\"make your goals public permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Make Your Goals Public</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>share your goals with someone and ask this person to hold you accountable</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"count-to-10\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#count-to-10\" aria-label=\"count to 10 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Count to 10</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When you feel yourself becoming frustrated or angry, count to 10 with a slow breath between each number.

They insist that an incident didn’t happen when it did, and they insist they did or said something when they didn’t. The trouble is, they’re so good at it that you end up questioning your own sanity. Insisting that whatever caused the problem is a figment of your imagination is an extremely powerful way of getting out of a jam. Their utter confidence in the lie makes you question your own perception of events. They are an emotional black hole. Whatever emotional manipulators are feeling, they’re geniuses at sucking everyone around them into those emotions. If they’re in a bad mood, everyone around them knows it. But that’s not the worst part: They’re so skillful that not only is everyone aware of their mood, but they also feel it. This creates a tendency for people to feel responsible for the manipulator’s moods and obligated to fix them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They are experts at doling out guilt.</strong> Emotional manipulators are masters at leveraging your guilt to their advantage. If you bring up something that’s bothering you, they make you feel guilty for mentioning it. If you don’t mention it, they make you feel guilty for keeping it to yourself and stewing about it. When you’re dealing with emotional manipulators, whatever you do is wrong, and no matter what problems the two of you are having, they’re your fault.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They claim the role of the victim.</strong> When it comes to emotional manipulators, nothing is ever their fault. No matter what they do (or fail to do) it’s someone else’s fault. Someone else made them do it and usually, it’s you. If you get mad or upset, it’s your fault for having unreasonable expectations. If they get mad, it’s your fault for upsetting them. Emotional manipulators don’t take accountability for anything.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Their actions don’t match their words.</strong> Emotional manipulators tell you what you want to hear, but their actions are another story. They pledge their support, but when it’s time to follow through, they act as though your requests are completely unreasonable. They tell you how lucky they are to know you, and then act as though you’re a burden. This is just another way of undermining your belief in your own sanity. They make you question reality as you see it and mold your perception according to what is convenient to them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They are too much, too soon.</strong> Whether it’s a personal relationship or a business relationship, emotional manipulators always seem to skip a few steps. They share too much too soon and expect the same from you. They appear vulnerable and sensitive, but it’s a ruse. The charade is intended to make you feel “special” for being let into their inner circle, but it’s also intended to make you feel not just sorry for them but also responsible for their feelings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They eagerly agree to help-and maybe even volunteer-and then act like martyrs</strong>. An initial eagerness to help swiftly morphs into sighs, groans, and suggestions that whatever they agreed to do is a huge burden. If you shine a spotlight on that reluctance, they’ll turn it around on you, assuring you that, of course, they want to help and that you’re just being paranoid. The goal? To make you feel guilty, indebted, and maybe even crazy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They always one-up you.</strong> No matter what problems you may have, emotional manipulators have it worse. They undermine the legitimacy of your complaints by reminding you that their problems are more serious. The message? You have no reason to complain, so shut the heck up.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>They know all your buttons and don’t hesitate to push them.</strong> Emotional manipulators know your weak spots, and they’re quick to use that knowledge against you. If you’re insecure about your weight, they comment on what you eat or the way your clothes fit. If you’re worried about an upcoming presentation, they point out how intimidating and judgmental the attendees are. Their awareness of your emotions is off the charts, but they use it to manipulate you, not to make you feel better.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-nine-toxic-types\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-nine-toxic-types\" aria-label=\"the nine toxic types permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE NINE TOXIC TYPES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Gossip</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eleanor Roosevelt famously said, “Great minds discuss ideas, average ones discuss events, and small minds discuss people.” Gossipers derive pleasure from other people’s misfortunes. It might be fun at first to discuss somebody else’s personal or professional misfortune, but over time, it gets tiring, makes you feel gross, and hurts other people. There are too many positives out there and too much to learn from interesting people to waste your time talking about the misfortunes of others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Victim</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Victims are tough to identify because you initially empathize with their problems. However, as time passes, you begin to realize that their “time of need” is all the time. Victims actively push away any personal responsibility by making every speed bump they encounter into an uncrossable mountain. They don’t see tough times as opportunities to learn and grow from; instead, they see them as an out. There’s an old saying: “Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.” It perfectly captures the toxicity of the victim, who chooses to suffer every time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Arrogant</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arrogant people are a waste of your time because they see everything you do as a personal challenge. Arrogance is false confidence, and it always masks major insecurities. Arrogant people tend to be lower performers, be more disagreeable, and have more cognitive problems than the average person. Arrogant people can be completely self-absorbed, and they bring you down through the impassionate distance they maintain from other people. You can usually tell when you’re hanging around self-absorbed people because you start to feel completely alone. This happens because as far as they’re concerned, there’s no point in having a real connection with anyone else. You’re merely a tool used to build their self-esteem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Envious</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To envious people, the grass is always greener somewhere else. Even when something great happens to envious people, they don’t derive any satisfaction from it. That’s because they measure their fortune against the world’s when they should be deriving their satisfaction from within. And let’s face it, there’s always someone out there who’s doing better if you look hard enough. Spending too much time around envious people is dangerous because they teach you to trivialize your own accomplishments.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Manipulator</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manipulators suck time and energy out of your life under the façade of friendship. They can be tricky to deal with because they treat you like a friend. They know what you like, what makes you happy, and what you think is funny. However, they use this information as part of a hidden agenda. Manipulators always want something from you, and if you look back on your relationships with them, it’s all take, take, take, with little or no giving. They’ll do anything to win you over, just so they can work you over.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Dementor</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In J. K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series, Dementors are evil creatures that suck people’s souls out of their bodies, leaving them shells of humans. Whenever a Dementor enters the room, it goes dark, people get cold, and they begin to recall their worst memories. Rowling said that she based them on highly negative people—the kind of people who have the ability to walk into a room and instantly suck the life out of it. Dementors suck the life out of the room by imposing their negativity and pessimism on everyone they encounter. Their viewpoints are always “the glass is half empty,” and they can inject fear and concern into even the most benign situations. A Notre Dame University study found that students assigned to roommates who thought negatively were far more likely to develop negative thinking and even depression themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Temperamental</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some people have absolutely no control over their emotions. They lash out at you and project their feelings onto you, all the while thinking that you’re the one causing their malaise. Temperamental people are tough to dump from your life because their lack of control over their emotions makes you feel bad for them. When push comes to shove, though, temperamental people will use you as their emotional toilet and should be avoided.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Twisted</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are certain toxic people who have bad intentions, deriving deep satisfaction from the pain and misery of others. They are out to hurt you, to make you feel bad, or to get something from you. Otherwise, they have no interest in you. The only good thing about this type is that you can spot their intentions quickly, which makes it that much faster to get them out of your life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Judgmental</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Judgmental people are quick to tell you exactly what is and isn’t cool. They have a way of taking the thing you’re most passionate about and making you feel terrible about it. Instead of appreciating and learning from people who are different from them, judgmental people look down on others. Judgmental people stifle your desire to be passionate and expressive, so you’re best off cutting them out and being yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"how-to-protect-yourself-from-toxic-people\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-protect-yourself-from-toxic-people\" aria-label=\"how to protect yourself from toxic people permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM TOXIC PEOPLE</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Set limits (especially with complainers).</strong> Complainers and negative people are bad news because they swallow in their problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want others to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to complainers because they don’t want to be seen as callous or rude, but there’s a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into their negative emotional spiral. You can avoid this only by setting limits and distancing yourself when necessary. One way to set a limit is to ask complainers how they intend to fix the problem. They will either quiet down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t die in the fight.</strong> People with high EQ know how important it is to live to fight another day, especially when your foe is a toxic individual. In conflict, unchecked emotion makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle that can leave you severely damaged. When you read and respond to your emotions, you’re able to choose your battles wisely and stand your ground only when the time is right.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stay aware of your emotions.</strong> Maintaining emotional distance requires awareness. You can’t stop someone from pushing your buttons if you don’t recognize when it’s happening. Sometimes, you’ll find yourself in situations in which you’ll need to regroup and choose the best way forward. This is fine, and you shouldn’t be afraid to buy yourself some time to do so. Think of it this way-if a mentally unstable person approaches you on the street and tells you he’s John F. Kennedy, you’re unlikely to set him straight. When you find yourself with a coworker who is engaged in similarly derailed thinking, sometimes it’s best to just smile and nod. If you’re going to have to straighten them out, it’s better to give yourself some time to plan the best way to go about it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rise above.</strong> Toxic people drive you crazy because their behavior is so irrational. Make no mistake about it; their behavior truly goes against reason. So, why do you allow yourself to respond to them emotionally and get sucked into the mix? The more irrational and off- base someone is, the easier it should be for you to remove yourself from their traps. Quit trying to beat them at their own game. You don’t need to respond to the emotional chaos-only the facts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Establish boundaries.</strong> People feel like because they work or live with someone, they have no way to control the chaos. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Once you find someone’s behavior more predictable and easier to understand, you are equipped to think rationally about when and where you have to put up with them and when you don’t. For example, even if you work closely with someone on a project team, you don’t need to have the same level of one-on- one interaction with them you have with your other team members. You can establish a boundary, but you’ll have to do it consciously and proactively. If you let things happen naturally, you’re bound to find yourself constantly embroiled in difficult conversations. If you set boundaries and decide when and where you’ll engage a difficult person, you can control much of the chaos. The only trick is to stick to your guns and keep boundaries in place when the person tries to encroach upon them which they will.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t focus on problems-only solutions.</strong> Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems you’re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and reduces stress. When it comes to toxic people, fixating on how crazy and difficult they are gives them power over you. Quit thinking about how troubling your difficult person is, and focus instead on how you’re going to handle them. This makes you more effective by putting you in control, and it will reduce the amount of stress you experience when interacting with them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t forget.</strong> Emotionally intelligent people are quick to forgive, but that doesn’t mean that they forget. Forgiveness requires letting go of what’s happened so that you can move on. It doesn’t mean you’ll give a wrongdoer another chance. Emotionally intelligent people are unwilling to be bogged down unnecessarily by others’ mistakes, so they let them go quickly and are assertive in protecting themselves from future harm.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use your support system.</strong> It’s tempting but ineffective to try to tackle everything by yourself. To deal with toxic people, you need to recognize the weaknesses in your approach to them. This means tapping into your support system to gain perspective on a challenging person. Everyone has someone who is on their team, rooting for them, and ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Identify these individuals in your life and seek their insight and assistance when you need it. Something as simple as explaining the situation can lead to a new perspective. Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can’t because they are not as emotionally invested in the situation as you are.</p>\n<h3 id=\"be-open-and-be-curious\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#be-open-and-be-curious\" aria-label=\"be open and be curious permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Be Open and Be Curious</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Give people enough information about you that they can understand your perspective.

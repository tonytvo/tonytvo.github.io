Awareness is the best way to beat these biases, so pay careful attention to how they influence you. Don’t allow them to hinder your emotional intelligence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Confirmation bias.</strong> Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek out information that supports our pre-existing beliefs. In other words, we form an opinion first and then seek out evidence to back it up, rather than basing our opinions on facts. Social media apps have been accused of using this bias to keep us engaged by loading our feeds with what we already believe, rather than challenging us with new information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fundamental attribution error.</strong> This is the tendency to attribute situational behavior to a person’s fixed personality. For example, people often attribute another person’s poor work performance to laziness when there are so many other possible explanations. It could be that the individual in question is receiving projects they aren’t passionate about, their rocky home life is carrying over to their work life, or they’re burned out. When you’re the one being lazy, you don’t assume it’s a character flaw. You attribute this to the situation you’re in. That’s how the fundamental attribution error works.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The decoy effect.</strong> This occurs when someone believes they have two options, but you present a third option to make the second one feel</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>more palatable. For example, you visit a car lot to consider two cars, one listed for $30,000 and one for $40,000. At first, the $40,000 car seems expensive, so the salesman shows you a $65,000 car. Suddenly, the $40,000 car seems reasonable by comparison. This salesman is preying on your decoy bias the decoy being the $65,000 car that he knows you won’t buy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The ideometer effect.</strong> This refers to the fact that our thoughts can make us feel real emotions. This is why actors envision terrible scenarios, such as the death of a loved one, in order to make themselves cry on cue. It’s also why activities such as cataloging what you’re grateful for can have such a profound, positive impact on your well-being.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The halo effect.</strong> The halo effect occurs when someone creates a strong first impression and that impression sticks. This is extremely noticeable in grading. For example, often a teacher grades a student’s first paper, and if it’s good, the teacher is prone to continue giving the student high marks for future papers even if their performance doesn’t warrant it. The same thing happens at work and in personal relationships.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The horn effect.</strong> This effect is the exact opposite of the halo effect. When you perform poorly at first, you can easily get pegged as a low performer, even if you work hard enough to disprove that notion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Conservatism bias.</strong> This bias leads people to believe that pre-existing information takes precedence over new information. Don’t be quick to reject something just because it’s radical or different. Great ideas usually are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Affect heuristic.</strong> Affect heuristic is the human tendency to base our decisions on our emotions. For example, consider a study conducted at Shukutoku University, Japan. Participants judged a disease that killed 1,286 people out of every 10,000 as being more dangerous than one that was 24.14% fatal (despite this representing twice as many deaths). People reacted emotionally to the image of 1,286 people dying, whereas the percentage didn’t arouse the same mental imagery and emotions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The ostrich effect.</strong> The ostrich effect is aptly named after the mistaken belief that ostriches, when scared, literally bury their heads in the ground. This effect describes our tendency to hide from impending problems. We may not physically bury our heads in the ground, but we might as well. For example, if your company is experiencing layoffs or you’re having relationship issues, it’s common to attempt to push all these problems away, rather than face them head on. This never works.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reactance.</strong> Reactance is our tendency to react to rules and regulations by exercising our freedom. A prevalent example of this is children with over-bearing parents. Tell a teenager to do what you say because you told them so, and they’re very likely to start breaking your rules. Similarly, employees who feel mistreated or “Big Brothered” by their employers are more likely to take longer breaks, use extra sick days, or even steal from their company.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Planning fallacy.</strong> Planning fallacy is the tendency to think that we can do things more quickly than we actually can. For procrastinators, this leads to incomplete work, and this makes Type As overpromise and underdeliver.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The bandwagon effect.</strong> The bandwagon effect is the tendency to do what everyone else is doing. This creates a kind of groupthink, where people run with the first idea that’s put onto the table instead of exploring a variety of options. The bandwagon effect illustrates how we like to make decisions based on what feels good (doing what everyone else is doing), even when it’s a poor alternative.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bias blind spot.</strong> If you begin to feel that you’ve mastered your biases, keep in mind that you’re most likely experiencing the bias blind spot. This is the tendency to see biases in other people but not in yourself.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"psychological-forces-that-make-good-people-do-bad-things\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#psychological-forces-that-make-good-people-do-bad-things\" aria-label=\"psychological forces that make good people do bad things permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>PSYCHOLOGICAL FORCES THAT MAKE GOOD PEOPLE DO BAD THINGS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The compensation effect.</strong> The compensation effect refers to people’s tendency to assume that they accumulate moral capital. We use good deeds to balance out bad deeds, or alternately, we give ourselves breaks from goodness, like a piece of chocolate cake after a week of salads. This makes people more inclined to do bad things under the guise of “I’m a good person” or “It’s just this one thing.” A great example of this is a study in which people were observed lying and cheating more after they made the decision to purchase products that were good for the environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cognitive dissonance.</strong> Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort humans feel when they hold two contradictory opinions or when their behavior is inconsistent with their beliefs. It’s one of the strongest psychological forces driving human behavior. When people who feel they are good do bad things, cognitive dissonance makes them ignore this behavior because they can’t tolerate the inconsistency between their behavior and their beliefs. This only leads to more bad behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The power of names.</strong> What you name something is important, because it can skew people’s sense of reality. If companies assign unethical practices simple and humorous euphemisms (like “financial engineering” for accounting fraud), employees are less likely to take their unethical behavior seriously. Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, was famous for saying, “Doing business is a game, the greatest game in the world if you know how to play it.” Something as simple as calling business a game can make people less likely to see that their actions have serious real-world consequences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Obedience to authority.</strong> It’s quite difficult for most people to ignore the wishes of those in positions of authority. People also feel that they’re less responsible for wrongdoings if they act under the direction of someone else. Both reasons explain why employees are likely to act out the unethical wishes of their supervisors and feel far less guilt than if they had decided to do it themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Pygmalion effect.</strong> The Pygmalion effect refers to people’s tendency to act the way that other people treat them. For example, if employees are treated like they’re upright members of a team, they’re more likely to act accordingly. Alternately, if they’re treated with</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>!!! suspicion, they’re more likely to act in a way that justifies that perception.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The pressure to conform.</strong> The pressure to conform is powerful. When a group engages in unethical behavior, individuals are far more likely to participate in or condone that behavior rather than risk standing out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Conspicuous consumption.</strong> When companies splash money around, they contribute to unethical behavior. Flashy displays of wealth lead to increased selfishness. Employees either aim hard for these carrots or develop jealousy of their high-rolling colleagues who achieve them. This leads to people who are more likely to put their own needs ahead of doing the right thing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The blinding effect of power.</strong> People in power typically see themselves as inherently different from their employees. This can lead them to set ethical boundaries for their employees that are more stringent than the ones they set for themselves. What happens next is the stuff of newspaper headlines.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"quit-treating-your-feelings-as-good-or-bad\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quit-treating-your-feelings-as-good-or-bad\" aria-label=\"quit treating your feelings as good or bad permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quit Treating Your Feelings as Good or Bad</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>pay attention when you feel an emotion begin to build.</li>\n<li>try to understand the emotions and avoid labelling them good or bad.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"observe-the-ripple-effect\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#observe-the-ripple-effect\" aria-label=\"observe the ripple effect permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Observe The Ripple Effect</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>pay attention to how your emotions affect others.</li>\n<li>ask others their view of how your emotions affect them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"lean-into-your-discomfort\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#lean-into-your-discomfort\" aria-label=\"lean into your discomfort permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Lean into Your Discomfort</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>ignoring feelings doesn’t make them go away.

It’s likely that lower levels of cortisol played a major role in this improvement. The Davis study participants had one simple task: Pause during the day to contemplate what they were grateful for. Lowering your cortisol is that easy.</li>\n<li>3 habits in the first 5 mins of the day (one of them is to write down what you’re grateful for)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stay positive.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. In these moments, think about your day, and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small. If you can’t think of something from the current day, reflect on the previous day or even the previous week. Or perhaps you’re looking forward to an exciting event that you can focus on. The point here is that you must have something positive that you’re ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative. Research from University College London found that negative thinkers have a significantly greater chance of developing dementia over just a four-year period.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Avoid asking, “What if?”</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“What if?” statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you’ll spend focusing on taking action that will calm you down and keep your stress under control. Calm people know that asking “What if?” will only take them to a place they don’t want or need to go. If you do find yourself having trouble letting go of a particular “What if?,” take a moment to consider your plan of action should it come to fruition and move on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Disconnect.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given the importance of keeping stress intermittent, it’s easy to see how taking regular time off the grid can help keep your stress under control. When you make yourself available to your work 24/7, you expose yourself to a constant barrage of stressors. Forcing yourself offline and even-gulp!-turning off your phone gives your body a break from a constant source of stress. Studies have shown that something as simple as an email break can lower stress levels.</li>\n<li>putting a mental recharge into your weekly schedule. If you’re worried about the negative repercussions of taking this step, first try doing it at times when you’re unlikely to be contacted-maybe Sunday morning. As you grow more comfortable with these breaks, and as your coworkers begin to accept that you spend time offline, gradually expand the amount of time you spend away from technology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Limit your caffeine intake.</strong> Drinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the “fight-or-flight” response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt email. When caffeine puts your brain and body into this hyper-aroused state of stress, your emotions outrun your behavior. The stress that caffeine creates is far from intermittent, as its long half-life ensures that it takes its sweet time working its way out of your body.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sleep.</strong> I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep for increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. Stressful projects often make you feel as if you have no time to sleep, but taking the time to get a decent night’s sleep is often the one thing keeping you from getting things under control. Many of us don’t know what appropriate sleep hygiene is or why we have such lousy sleep. The chapter on cleaning up your sleep hygiene will help</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>you make your sleep top notch. Reframe your perspective. Stress and worry are fueled by our own skewed perceptions of events. It’s easy to think that unrealistic deadlines, unforgiving bosses, and out-of-control traffic are the reasons you’re so stressed all the time. You can’t control your circumstances, but you can control how you respond to them. <strong>So, before you spend too much time dwelling on something, take a minute to put the situation into perspective.</strong>. If you’re thinking in broad, sweeping statements such as “Everything is going wrong” or “Nothing will work out,” then you need to reframe the situation. A great way to correct this unproductive thought pattern is to list specific things that are actually going wrong or not working out. Most likely, you will come up with only a few things (not everything), and the scope of these stressors will look much more limited than they initially appeared.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Breathe.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Practicing being in the moment with your breathing will train your brain to focus on the task at hand and get the stress monkey off your back. When you’re feeling stressed, take a couple of minutes to focus on your breathing. Close the door, put away all other distractions, and just sit in your chair and breathe. Your goal is to spend the entire time focused on your breathing, which will prevent your mind from wandering. Think about how it feels to breathe in and out. This sounds simple, but it’s hard to do it for more than a minute or two. It’s all right if you get sidetracked by another thought. This will happen at the beginning, and you just need to bring your focus back to your breathing. If you struggle to stay focused on your breathing, try counting each breath in and out until you get to 20, and then start again from 1. Don’t worry if you lose count. You can always just start over.</li>\n<li>Shallow breaths deprive your brain of oxygen. This leads to poor concentration, forgetfulness, mood swings, anxiety and lack of energy. Breathe slowly and deeply.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Say no.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research conducted at the University of California, Berkeley, showed that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you will experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Saying no is indeed a major challenge for many people. “No” is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it’s time to say no, avoid phrases such as “I don’t think I can” or “I’m not certain.” Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Neutralize toxic people.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dealing with difficult people is frustrating, exhausting, and highly stressful. You can control your interactions with toxic people by keeping your feelings in check. When you need to confront a toxic person, approach the situation rationally. Identify your emotions, and don’t allow anger or frustration to add to the chaos. In addition, consider the difficult person’s viewpoint and perspective so that you can find solutions and common ground. When things completely derail, take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting them bring you down. This is easier said than done, which is why there’s a separate chapter on techniques and habits for neutralizing toxic people.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t hold grudges.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The negative emotions that come with holding onto a grudge are actually a stress response. Just thinking about the event sends your body into fight-or-flight mode. When the threat is imminent, this reaction is essential to your survival, but when the threat is ancient history, holding onto that stress wreaks havoc on your body and can have devastating health consequences over time. In fact, researchers at Emory University have shown that holding onto stress contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease. Holding onto a grudge means you’re holding onto stress, and emotionally intelligent people know to avoid this at all costs. Letting go of a grudge not only makes you feel better now but can also improve your health.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Practice mindfulness.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mindfulness is a simple, research-supported form of meditation that helps you gain control of unruly thoughts and behaviors. People who practice mindfulness regularly are more focused, even when they are not meditating. It is an excellent technique to help reduce stress, because it helps you reduce the feeling of not being in control. Essentially, mindfulness helps you stop jumping from one thought to the next, which keeps you from ruminating on negative thoughts. Overall, it’s a great way to make it through your busy day calmly and productively. There’s a separate chapter on how to practice this technique.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"structuring-your-free-time-alleviates-stress\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#structuring-your-free-time-alleviates-stress\" aria-label=\"structuring your free time alleviates stress permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>STRUCTURING YOUR FREE TIME ALLEVIATES STRESS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A Stanford study found that productivity per hour declines sharply when a workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that there’s no point in working any more. That’s right. People who work as much as 70 hours (or more) per week actually get the same amount done as people who work 55 hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 1: Minimize chores.</strong> Chores tend to monopolize your free time. When this happens, you lose the opportunity to relax and reflect. What’s worse, doing a lot of chores feels like work, and if you spend all weekend doing them, you just put in a seven-day workweek. To keep this from happening, you need to schedule your chores like you would anything else during the week. If you don’t complete them during the allotted time, you move on and finish them the following weekend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 2: Exercise.</strong> No time to exercise during the week? You have 48 hours every weekend to make it happen. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a soothing neurotransmitter that reduces stress. Exercise is also a great way to come up with new ideas. Innovators and other successful people know that being outdoors often sparks creativity. I know that a lot of my best ideas come to me while I’m surfing. While you’re out in the ocean, the combination of invigorating activity and beautiful scenery creates the perfect environment to be creative. Whether you’re running, cycling, or gardening, exercise leads to endorphin-fueled introspection. The key is to find a physical activity that does this for you and then to make it an important part of your weekly routine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 3: Pursue a passion.</strong> You might be surprised what happens when you pursue something you’re passionate about during your time off. Indulging your passions is a great way to escape stress and open your mind to new ways of thinking. Things like playing music, reading, writing, painting, or even playing catch with your kids can help stimulate different modes of thought that can reap huge dividends over the coming week.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 4: Spend quality time with your family.</strong> Spending quality time with your family is essential if you want to recharge and relax. Weekdays are so hectic that the entire week can fly by with little quality family time. Don’t let this bleed into your weekends. Take your kids to the park, take your spouse to their favorite restaurant, and go visit your parents. You’ll be glad you did.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 5: Schedule micro-adventures.</strong> Buy tickets to a concert or play, or make reservations for that cool new hotel that just opened downtown. Instead of running on a treadmill, plan a hike. Try something you haven’t done before, or perhaps something you haven’t done in a long time. Studies have shown that anticipating something good is a significant part of what makes the activity pleasurable. Knowing that you have something interesting planned for Saturday will not only be fun come Saturday but will also significantly improve your mood throughout the week.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 6: Designate mornings as me time.</strong> Your mind achieves peak performance two to four hours after you wake up, so get up early to do something physical and invigorating, and then save the mental tasks for later in the morning when your mind is at its peak.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rule 7: Prepare for the upcoming week.</strong> The weekend is a great time to spend a few moments planning your upcoming week. As little as 30 minutes of planning can yield significant gains in productivity and reduced stress. The week feels a lot more manageable when you go into it with a plan, because all you have to focus on is execution. Weekly reflection is a powerful tool for improvement. Use the weekend to contemplate the larger forces that are shaping your industry, your organization, and your job. Without the distractions of Monday to Friday busy work, you should be able to see things in a whole new light. Use this insight to alter your approach to the coming week, which improves the efficiency and efficacy of your work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"make-smart-decisions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#make-smart-decisions\" aria-label=\"make smart decisions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>make smart decisions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Turn small decisions into routines.</strong> Decision-making works like a muscle: As you use it over the course of the day, it gets too exhausted to function effectively. One of the best strategies successful people use to work around their decision fatigue is to eliminate smaller decisions by turning them into routines. Doing so frees up mental resources for more complex decisions. Steve Jobs famously wore a black turtleneck to work every day. Mark Zuckerberg still wears a hoodie. Both men have stated that these iconic images are the simple result of daily routines intended to cut down on decision fatigue. They were both aware of our finite daily ability to make good decisions, as is Barack Obama, who said, “You’ll see I wear only gray or blue suits. I’m trying to pare down decisions. I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing, because I have too many other decisions to make.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Make big decisions in the morning.</strong> Another great way to beat decision fatigue is to save small decisions for after work (when decision fatigue is greatest) and tackle complex decisions in the morning, when your mind is fresh. When you’re facing a stream of important decisions, a great trick is to wake up early and work on your most complicated tasks before you get hit with a bunch of distracting minor decisions (phones ringing, emails coming in). A similar strategy is to do some of the smaller things the night before to get a head start on the next day. For instance, lay out your outfit at night, so you don’t even have to think about it when you wake up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pay close attention to your emotions.</strong> There’s an old saying: “Don’t make permanent decisions based on temporary emotions.” Emotionally intelligent people recognize and understand their emotions (including their intensity and their impact on behavior) so that they are able to look at decisions as objectively and rationally as possible. Unfortunately, most people aren’t good at recognizing their emotions. Strong decision makers, however, know that a bad mood can make them lash out or stray from their moral compass just as easily as a good mood can make them overconfident and impulsive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Evaluate your options objectively.</strong> When really wrapped up in a decision, emotionally intelligent people weigh their options against a pre-determined set of criteria because they know that this makes decision-making easier and more effective. Here are some helpful criteria to consider: How does this decision benefit me? How does it hurt me? How does this benefit? How does it hurt? Does the decision reflect my values? Would I regret making this decision? Would I regret not making this decision?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sleep on it.</strong> Sleeping on your decision ensures that you have clarity of thought when you approach it the next day. It also allows time</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>for your emotions to run their course. When you act too quickly, you tend to react, but when you give more focus and time to your decision, you expose important facets of it that you didn’t see before.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t sleep on it for too long.</strong> Emotionally intelligent people know the importance of gathering as much information as they can, but at the same time, they make certain not to fall prey to analysis paralysis. Instead of waiting for the moons to align, emotionally intelligent people know that they need to have a timetable for making their decision. Once they set that date, they are motivated to do their homework and some soul searching to meet the deadline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use exercise to recharge.</strong> This isn’t the first time I’ve touted the benefits of exercise for emotional intelligence, and it won’t be the last. The stress of a major decision naturally produces cortisol, the chemical that triggers the fight-or-flight response. Cortisol clouds your ability to think clearly and rationally. When you find yourself stressing about a decision, try exercising. As little as 30 minutes is all it takes to get a good endorphin-fueled buzz and return to mental clarity. Exercise also helps you get past that fight-or-flight state by putting the cortisol to practical use. Researchers have shown that long-term exercise improves the overall functioning of the brain regions responsible for decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Seek outside counsel.</strong> When approaching a decision, we naturally tend to pick an alternative and then gather information to support that decision, instead of gathering information and then choosing a side (this is called confirmation bias). A great way to beat confirmation bias is to seek outside opinions and advice from people who bring different perspectives to your situation. Their perspectives help you weigh your options more objectively and spot your subjective or irrational tendencies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reflect on previous decisions.</strong> Mark Twain described the complicated nature of decision-making as follows: “Good decisions come from experience, but experience comes from making bad decisions.” This isn’t to say that the only way to become a great decision maker is to make a ton of mistakes. It just means that it’s important to keep past decisions front of mind.

You have to slow down and listen, which often requires solitude. Taking some time away from the everyday, even something as brief as going for a walk, is a great way to turn up the volume of your intuition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Follow your inner voice.</strong> One of the primary reasons that some people are more intuitive than others is that they actually listen to their gut feeling instead of dismissing or doubting it. That doesn’t mean that they ignore their analytical mind and their critical thinking skills. There’s a difference between using reason as a system of checks and balances and using it to talk yourself out of what your intuition knows to be true.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Practice empathic accuracy.</strong> I’d probably lose you if I said that highly intuitive people read minds, so I’ll use the scientific term: empathic accuracy. It’s not magic; it’s an intuitive awareness of what other people are thinking and feeling, using cues such as body language and tone of voice. It’s an extremely powerful form of empathy that helps foster deep connections with other people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Practice mindfulness.</strong> “Mindfulness” sounds even more New-Agey than trusting your intuition, but it’s really just a fancy term for focusing on being in the moment. Mindfulness is a great technique for filtering out all of the distractions in your environment and your brain. When you do that, you can hear your intuition loud and clear.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Nurture your creativity.</strong> Did you have a paint-by-number kit when you were a kid? Talk about turning art into a science all you have to do is put the right color in the right little space. You may end up with a pretty painting, but the only intuition involved is guessing what colors you’re supposed to use in those really tiny spaces. No paint-by-numbers kit in the world can make a skilled artist create something as novel and monumental as the Sistine Chapel or the Mona Lisa. The missing ingredient is intuition. Just as intuition is the secret ingredient in creativity, being intentionally creative strengthens your use of intuition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Listen to your body.</strong> Have you ever made a decision and immediately felt sick-maybe even kind of clammy? That affective experience is your body’s way of informing you that the decision your analytic mind came to is at odds with your instinct.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Analyze your dreams.</strong> If you accept the science that demonstrates the power of intuition, it’s not much of a leap to accept that your dreams are often manifestations of intuition. Sure, sometimes dreams are nonsense, but they often try to tell us something. Intuitive people don’t just think, “Wow, that was a weird dream!” They ask themselves, “Where did that come from, and what can I take away from it?”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"dealing-with-uncertainty\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#dealing-with-uncertainty\" aria-label=\"dealing with uncertainty permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTY</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quiet your limbic system.</strong> Your limbic system responds to uncertainty with a knee-jerk fear reaction, and fear inhibits good decision- making. People who are good at dealing with uncertainty are wary of this fear and spot it as soon as it surfaces. This way, they can contain it before it gets out of control. Once they are aware of the fear, they label all the irrational thoughts that try to intensify it as irrational fears not reality-and the fear subsides. Then they can focus more accurately and rationally on the information they have. Throughout the process, they remind themselves that a primitive part of their brain is trying to take over and that the logical part needs to be the one in charge. In other words, they tell their limbic system to settle down and be quiet unless a hungry tiger shows up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t seek perfection.</strong> Emotionally intelligent people don’t set perfection as their target because they know there’s no such thing as a perfect decision in an uncertain situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Know what you know-and what you don’t.</strong> When uncertainty makes a decision difficult, it’s easy to feel as if everything is uncertain,</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>but that’s hardly ever the case. People who excel at managing uncertainty start by taking stock of what they know and what they don’t know and assigning a factor of importance to each. They gather all the facts they have, and they take their best shot at compiling a list of things they don’t know, for example, what a country’s currency is going to do or what strategy a competitor will employ. They actually try to identify as many of these things as possible, because this takes away their power. Then they can make the best decision possible with the facts they have.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Embrace that which you can’t control.</strong> We all like to be in control. After all, people who feel like they’re at the mercy of their surroundings never get anywhere in life. But this desire for control can backfire when you see everything that you can’t control or don’t know as a personal failure. People who excel at managing uncertainty aren’t afraid to acknowledge what’s causing it. In other words, they live in the real world. They don’t paint any situation as better or worse than it actually is, and they analyze the facts for what they are. They know that the only thing they really control is the process through which they reach their decisions. That’s the only rational way to handle the unknown, and the best way to keep your head on level ground. Don’t be afraid to step up and say, “Here’s what we don’t know, but we’re going forward based on what we do know. We may make mistakes, but that’s a lot better than standing still.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Focus on what matters.</strong> Some decisions can make or break you. Most just aren’t that important. The people who are the best at making decisions in the face of uncertainty don’t waste their time getting stuck on decisions where the biggest risk is looking foolish. When it comes down to it, almost every decision contains at least a small factor of uncertainty-it’s an inevitable part of life. Learning to properly balance the many decisions on your plate, however, allows you to focus your energy on the things that matter and to make more informed choices. It also removes the unnecessary pressure and distraction caused by a flurry of small worries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Know when to trust your gut.</strong> Our ancestors relied on their intuition-their gut instinct for survival. Since most of us don’t face life-or- death decisions every day, we have to learn how to use this instinct to our benefit. I explained the importance of trusting your intuition earlier in this chapter, but the importance of your intuition in making good decisions is magnified the more you’re facing uncertainty. People who successfully deal with uncertainty recognize and embrace the power of their gut instincts, and they rely on some tried-and- true strategies to do so successfully:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>They recognize their own filters.</strong></em> They’re able to identify when they’re overly influenced by their assumptions and emotions or by another person’s opinion, for example. Their ability to filter out the feelings that aren’t coming from their intuition helps them focus on what is.</li>\n<li><em><strong>They give their intuition some space.</strong></em> Gut instincts can’t be forced. Our intuition works best when we’re not pressuring it to come up with a solution. Albert Einstein said he got his best ideas while sailing, and when Steve Jobs was faced with a tough problem, he’d head out for a walk.</li>\n<li><em><strong>They build a track record.</strong></em> People who deal well with uncertainty take the time to practice their intuition. They start by listening to their gut on small things and seeing how it goes so that they’ll know whether they can trust it when something big comes around. Have contingency plans. Staying on top of uncertainty is as much about planning for failure as it is about hoping for the best. Experts at handling uncertainty aren’t afraid to admit that they could be wrong, and that frees them up to make detailed, rational, and transparent contingency plans before taking action. Emotionally intelligent people know they aren’t always going to make the right decision. They know how to absorb and understand mistakes so that they can make better decisions in the future. And they never let mistakes get them down for too long.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"break-the-bad-habits-that-are-holding-you-back\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#break-the-bad-habits-that-are-holding-you-back\" aria-label=\"break the bad habits that are holding you back permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>break the bad habits that are holding you back</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Once a habit becomes automatic, it’s a lot harder to break- and that’s why you’re probably failing if you’re not giving yourself 66 days to wean yourself off it. Sixty-six days might seem like a long time, but there are specific stages that make the process feel much shorter. Let’s look at them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Days 1-10: Look Inward</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s usually pretty obvious which bad habits are causing the most problems in your life-the ones that keep coming up in performance appraisals or sparking arguments with your spouse. Once you’ve identified a habit to change, the real challenge lies in understanding your triggers. That can be harder than it sounds, especially if the habit has become so ingrained that you do it subconsciously. If you give it enough thought, you’ll get to the bottom of it. Maybe you keep getting tickets for speeding, and you realize that you drive too fast when you leave work in a bad mood, or maybe you snack when you’re stressed. Looking inward to explore the source of the habit you’re trying to break makes breaking that habit possible. The first 10 days of trying to break the habit will provide substantial insight into its source, should you look.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Days 11-40: Spread the Word</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accountability is crucial for breaking bad habits. In this stage, you create a very vocal accountability network by telling everybody you can about the habit you’re trying to break. The more vocal you are about it, the more likely people are to call you out when you slip up. Let them know that you really want them to say something. Just remember that you might have to keep reminding them—it’s just as easy for them to forget and backslide as it is for you. Accountability feeds your efforts to avoid bad habits. Sure, you avoid them some on your own, but your efforts are turbocharged when you don’t want the negative attention that comes with engaging in your bad habits. Before long, you’ve had enough practice avoiding them, and sometimes you don’t even have to think about it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Days 41-66: Mind Your Relapse Triggers</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>As you head for the home stretch, be ready to make some mistakes-it happens to everybody. Just be on the lookout for common threads running through those mistakes. If you tend to relapse in a certain situation, you’d be smart to avoid that trigger completely until you feel that your bad habit is really extinguished. In addition, keep an eye out for new or rare triggers that haven’t popped up yet. Keeping new triggers from surprising you when it feels like you’ve kicked a habit is typically the difference between success and failure this late in the process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Day 67: Reward Yourself</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sure, you could say that breaking the habit is its own reward, but why pass up an opportunity to celebrate? Just don’t celebrate by indulging in the habit that you worked so hard to break! Rewarding yourself is critical because it reinforces the new habit loop you’ve created to replace and extinguish the bad habit. You’ve replaced your old negative responses to your triggers with positive new ones. Without a clear and apparent reward, your mind might lose the urge to follow through in the future. You should also use this opportunity to reflect on and select the next habit you’re going to break.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-bad-habits-you-must-break\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-bad-habits-you-must-break\" aria-label=\"the bad habits you must break permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE BAD HABITS YOU MUST BREAK</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The self-control required to develop good habits (and stop bad ones) also serves as the foundation for a strong work ethic and high productivity. Some bad habits cause more trouble than others. The following bad habits are the worst offenders. Shedding them will increase your productivity and allow you to enjoy the positive mood that comes with increased self-control.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Impulsively surfing the Internet.</strong> It takes you 15 consecutive minutes of focus before you can fully engage in a task. Once you do, you fall into a euphoric state of increased productivity called flow. Research has shown that people in a flow state are five times more productive than they would otherwise be. When you click out of your work because you get an itch to check the news, Facebook, a sport’s score, or what have you, this pulls you out of flow. This means you have to go through another 15 minutes of continuous focus to reenter the flow state. Click in and out of your work enough times, and you can go through an entire day without experiencing high productivity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Eating too much sugar.</strong> Glucose functions as the “gas pedal” for energy in the brain. You need glucose to concentrate on challenging tasks. With too little glucose, you feel tired, unfocused, and slow; too much glucose leaves you jittery and unable to concentrate. The tricky thing is that you can get your glucose any way you want, and you’ll feel the same at least initially. The difference lies in how long your productivity lasts. Donuts, soda, and other forms of refined sugar lead to an energy boost that lasts only 20 minutes, while oatmeal, brown rice, and other foods containing complex carbohydrates release their energy slowly, enabling you to sustain your focus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Using multiple notifications.</strong> Multiple notifications are a productivity nightmare. Studies have shown that hopping on your phone and email every time they ping causes your productivity to plummet. Getting notified every time a message drops onto your phone or an email arrives in your inbox might feel productive, but it isn’t. Instead of working at the whim of your notifications, pool all your emails/ texts and check them at designated times (e.g., respond to your emails every hour). This is a proven, productive way to work. In addition to checking email on a schedule, productive people take advantage of features that prioritize messages by sender. They set alerts for their most important vendors and their best customers, and they save the rest until they reach a stopping point in their work. Some people even set up an autoresponder that lets senders know when they’ll be checking their email again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Putting off tough tasks.</strong> We have a limited amount of mental energy, and as we exhaust this energy, our decision-making and productivity decline rapidly. This is called decision fatigue. When you put off tough tasks until late in the day because they’re intimidating, you save them for when you’re at your worst. To beat decision fatigue, you should tackle complex tasks in the morning when your mind is fresh.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Letting toxic people live in your head rent free.</strong> There will always be toxic people who have a way of getting under your skin and staying there. Each time you find yourself thinking about a coworker or person who makes your blood boil, practice being grateful for someone else in your life instead. There are plenty of people out there who deserve your attention, and the last thing you want to do is think about the people who don’t matter when there are people who do.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hitting the snooze button.</strong> When you sleep, your brain moves through an elaborate series of cycles, the last of which prepares you to be alert at your wake-up time. This is why you sometimes wake up right before your alarm clock goes off your brain knows it’s time to wake up, and it’s ready to do so. When you hit the snooze button and fall back asleep, you lose this alertness and wake up later, tired and groggy. Worst of all, this grogginess can take hours to wear off. So, no matter how tired you think you are when your alarm clock goes off, force yourself out of bed if you want to have a productive morning.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-real-harm-in-multitasking\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-real-harm-in-multitasking\" aria-label=\"the real harm in multitasking permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE REAL HARM IN MULTITASKING</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The researchers showed that people who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information, or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They found that heavy multitaskers-those who multitask a lot and feel that it boosts their performance were actually worse at multitasking than those who like to do a single thing at a time. The frequent multitaskers performed worse because they had more trouble organizing their thoughts and filtering out irrelevant information, and they were slower at switching from one task to another. Ouch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multitasking reduces your efficiency and performance because your brain can focus on only one thing at a time. When you try to do two things at once, your brain lacks the capacity to perform both tasks successfully. Researchers have also shown that in addition to slowing you down, multitasking temporarily lowers your IQ. A study at the University of London found that participants who multitasked during cognitive tasks experienced IQ score declines that were similar to what they’d expect if they had stayed up all night.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you’re prone to multitasking, this is a bad habit you’ll want to break-it clearly slows you down and decreases the quality of your work. Even if it doesn’t cause brain damage, allowing yourself to multitask will fuel any existing difficulties you have with concentration, organization, and attention to detail. Multitasking in meetings and other social settings indicates low self- and social awareness, two emotional intelligence skills that are critical to success at work. If multitasking does damage your anterior cingulate cortex (a key brain region for EQ), as current research suggests, it will lower your EQ in the process. So, every time you multitask, you aren’t just harming your performance in the moment; you may very well be damaging an area of your brain that’s critical to your future success at work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"build-powerful-new-success-habits\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#build-powerful-new-success-habits\" aria-label=\"build powerful new success habits permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Build Powerful New Success Habits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You should be very careful in choosing your pursuits, because your habits make you. Cultivating the right habits will take you where you want to go in life. The emotional intelligence habits that follow are a great start. They will help you lead a more meaningful and fulfilling life in which you cultivate the best within yourself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be biased toward action.</strong> If only we knew about all the great ideas that never came to fruition because people lacked the confidence to put them into action. Emotionally intelligent people confidently act on their ideas because they know that a failed idea is not a reflection of their ability; instead, they see it as a wonderful learning opportunity. This makes them eager to get going.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Seek composure.</strong> People who are composed constantly monitor their emotions. They understand their emotions well, and they use this knowledge in the moment to react with self-control to challenging situations. When things go downhill, they are persistently calm and frustratingly content (frustrating to those who aren’t, at least). They know that no matter how good or bad things get, everything changes with time. All they can do is adapt and adjust to stay happy and in control.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Appreciate the here and now.</strong> Gratitude is fundamental to peace and happiness—not wealth, glamour, adventure, or fast cars, but simple appreciation for what you have. Just because you can’t afford champagne and caviar doesn’t mean that you never enjoy a meal. Hot dogs and beer on the back deck with your friends can taste just as good. So don’t fool yourself into thinking that to be happy you need</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>something that you don’t have. The truth is that if you don’t appreciate what you have now, you won’t be able to appreciate the “good life” if you ever get it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Realize that things aren’t always as you perceive them to be.</strong> This goes along with appreciating the here and now. That person you envy because they seem to have the perfect life might be dealing with all kinds of problems behind closed doors. That “perfection” could be a total mirage. Your employer’s decision to move the office might seem like a huge hassle when you first hear about it, but it could end up being one of the best things that ever happens to you. You’re not omniscient and you’re not a fortune-teller, so be open to the possibility that life might have some surprises in store, because what you see is not always what you get.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stick to realistic goals.</strong> How many people start January by proclaiming, “I’m going to lose 30 pounds by March!“? Big, scary, crazy goals can be incredibly inspiring until you fall short, and then, instead of inspiration, you’re left with disappointment and guilt. Don’t stop setting goals that push and challenge you, but try to stick within the bounds of reality. Small habits make big gains with time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expose yourself to a variety of people.</strong> There’s no easier way to learn to think differently than spending time with someone whose strengths are your weaknesses or whose ideas are radically different from your own. This exposure sparks new ideas and makes you well rounded. This is why we see so many great companies with cofounders who are very different. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at Apple were prime examples. Neither could have succeeded without the other.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Turn tedious tasks into games.</strong> Every job entails some degree of tedium. For most people, tedium leads to sloppy, rushed work. Emotionally intelligent people find ways to make the tedious interesting. By turning tedious work into a game, they challenge themselves and produce high-quality work, making things interesting in the process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Start a collection of things that truly resonate with you.</strong> Have you ever come across a quote or a meme that so perfectly summed up your feelings that you wanted to keep it forever? When you come across things that resonate with you (whether it’s something that expresses who you are or who you want to be), have a central place to keep those gems. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a spiral notebook, a bulletin board, or a folder on Evernote. Have a place to collect the things that matter so that you can revisit them regularly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Get out and do something that reminds you who you are.</strong> We all joke about having “me” time, but what is that, really? It’s making time for the activities that we feel most authentically ourselves doing. These are the times when all the masks are off, and we can just be. Whether it’s going for a run or dancing around with your ’80s favorites blaring at top volume, make time for those moments. They’re incredibly rejuvenating.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-paradoxical-habits-of-wildly-successful-people\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-paradoxical-habits-of-wildly-successful-people\" aria-label=\"the paradoxical habits of wildly successful people permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE PARADOXICAL HABITS OF WILDLY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They’re convergent and divergent thinkers.</strong> Convergent thinking is what’s measured by IQ tests: rational thinking that typically results in a single right answer. Divergent thinking, on the other hand, is less precise. It’s about generating ideas and asking questions that have no solid right or wrong answers. Both are important. No matter how high your IQ, you’re not going to be successful if you can’t think outside the proverbial box. On the other hand, you need rational thinking skills to correctly judge whether your ideas have merit. That’s why this particular paradox is so important.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They’re polite yet completely unafraid to rock the boat.</strong> Successful people are what I like to call “graciously disruptive.” They’re never satisfied with the status quo. They’re the ones who constantly ask, “What if?” and “Why not?” They’re not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom, but they don’t disrupt things for the sake of being disruptive. They do it to make things better. Still, they’re polite and considerate, and they don’t draw attention to other people’s mistakes just to humiliate them. However, that doesn’t mean they sit back and let people wander in the wrong direction. They won’t hesitate to speak up when it’s time to change course.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They’re naïve and smart.</strong> No one would argue that intelligence isn’t an important part of success, but many successful people also have a childlike lack of awareness (or maybe it’s a lack of respect for) of the type of constraints that other people blindly accept. They’re not limited by what other people tell them is possible. This naiveté allows them to tackle problems from previously undiscovered angles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They’re both energetic and calm.</strong> Successful people seem to have limitless energy when it comes to doing the things they’re passionate about, but they aren’t frantic. They can keep that energy under control. They work hard and focus on the task at hand with devoted concentration, but they’re so smooth that they make it look easy and fun. Some people are so energetic that they’re hyperactive, unfocused, and constantly bouncing from one thing to another. Successful people know how to harness their energy so that it works in the service of progress and doesn’t undermine it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They’re deeply passionate yet rational and objective about their work.</strong> Successful people are passionate about their work, but they don’t let it skew their thinking. They have the ability to step back and look at their work with a critical eye and accept their mistakes. If it’s a disaster, they’ll admit it because they realize that it’s better to try something different than to put out something subpar with their name on it. This sense of detachment also allows them to accept feedback from others without taking it personally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They’re ambiverts.</strong> Successful people are comfortable acting in ways that amplify their introversion and extraversion, depending on what the situation calls for. They can sit in the back of a conference room and silently listen to what’s going on, or they can go up on stage, grab a microphone, and engage a huge crowd-and they look just as comfortable doing one as they do the other.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They’re both humble and proud.</strong> Taking pride in your work is absolutely essential for success, but successful people know they wouldn’t be where they are without the people who came before them and those they’ve worked with along the way. They know that they didn’t achieve their success all on their own, and because they’re okay with that, they don’t have anything to prove. That’s why so many incredibly successful people end up coming across as grounded and humble when you meet them in person.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They dream big but remain grounded.</strong> Successful people reach for the seemingly impossible, but they do so in a way that is actionable and realistic. While you may not know exactly how you’re going to achieve your dream, you need to make progress, no matter how small the steps. For example, Elon Musk’s goal at SpaceX is to “Occupy Mars.” This is a big dream, but Musk keeps it realistic by engaging in regular steps that, someday, may get them there. SpaceX’s ability to reuse rocket boosters is radically reducing the cost of space travel. It’s a far cry from colonizing Mars, but it’s an essential step in a very ambitious process.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-unusual-habits-of-the-worlds-most-creative-people\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-unusual-habits-of-the-worlds-most-creative-people\" aria-label=\"the unusual habits of the worlds most creative people permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE UNUSUAL HABITS OF THE WORLD’S MOST CREATIVE PEOPLE</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wake Up Early</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not all creative minds are morning people. Franz Kafka routinely stayed up all night writing, and William Styron (author of Sophie’s Choice, among other best-sellers) woke up at noon every day and considered his “morning” routine to be staying in bed for another hour to think. However, early risers make up the clear majority of creative thinkers. The list of creative early risers ranges from Benjamin Franklin to Howard Schultz to Ernest Hemingway, although they didn’t wake up early for the same reasons. Ben Franklin woke up early to plan his day, while Schultz used the time to send motivational emails to his employees. For many creative people, waking up early is a way to avoid distractions. Ernest Hemingway woke up at 5 a.m. every day to write. He said, “There is no one to disturb you and it is cool and cold and you come to your work and warm as you write.” The trick to making getting up early stick is to do it every day and avoid naps. Eventually, you’ll start going to bed earlier to make up for the lost sleep. This can make for a couple of groggy days at first, but you’ll adjust quickly. Before you know it, you’ll join the ranks of creative early risers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep Your Day Job</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creativity flourishes when you’re creating for yourself and no one else. Creativity becomes more difficult when your livelihood depends on what you create (and when you begin to think too much about what your audience will think of your product). Perhaps this is why so many successful and creative people held on to their day jobs. Many of them, like Stephen King, who was a schoolteacher, produced their breakout (and, in King’s case, what many consider his very best) work while they still held a 9 to 5. Day jobs provide more than the much-needed financial security to create freely. They also add structure to your day that can make your creative time a wonderful release. The list of successful, creative minds who kept their day jobs is long. Some notable individuals include Jacob Arabo, who started designing his own jewelry while working in a jewelry shop; William Faulkner, who worked in a power plant while writing As I Lay Dying; and composer Philip Glass, who worked as a plumber.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exercise Frequently</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s plenty of evidence pointing to the benefits of exercise for creativity. Feeling good physically gets you in the right mood to focus and be productive. Exercise also forces you to have disconnected time (it’s tough to text or email while working out hard), and this allows you to reflect on whatever it is you’re working on. In a Stanford study, 90% of people were more creative after exercising. It’s no surprise that so many creative and successful people build exercise into their daily routines. Kurt Vonnegut took walks into the nearby town, swam laps, and did push-ups and sit-ups, Richard Branson runs every morning, and composers Beethoven and Tchaikovsky walked every day.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stick to a Strict Schedule</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s a common misconception that in order to be creative, you should live life on a whim with no structure and no sense of needing to do anything. The habits of highly successful and creative people suggest otherwise. In fact, most creative minds scheduled their days rigorously. Psychologist William James described the impact of a schedule on creativity, saying that only by having a schedule can we “free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn to Work Anywhere, Anytime</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many people work in only one place, believing it’s practically impossible for them to get anything done anywhere else. Staying in one place is actually a crutch; studies show that changing environments is beneficial to productivity and creativity. E.B. White, author of Charlotte’s Web, said it well: “A writer who waits for ideal conditions under which to work will die without putting a word on paper.” The same is true for any type of creative work. If you keep waiting until you’re in the perfect place at the ideal time, the time will never come. Steve Jobs started Apple in his mom’s garage, and J.K. Rowling wrote the first ideas for Harry Potter on a napkin on a train. When you have a creative idea, don’t wait. Put it into action as soon as you can. Recording that spark of creativity may very well be the foundation of something great.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn that Creative Blocks Are Just Procrastination</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As long as your heart is still beating, you have the ability to come up with new ideas and execute them. They may not always be great ones, but the greatest enemy of creativity is inactivity. Author Jodi Picoult summarized creative blocks perfectly: “I don’t believe in writer’s block. Think about it—when you were blocked in college and had to write a paper, didn’t it always manage to fix itself the night before the paper was due? Writer’s block is having too much time on your hands. If you have a limited amount of time to write, you just sit down and do it. You might not write well every day, but you can always edit a bad page. You can’t edit a blank page.” Picoult’s comment describes all creative activity-the only way to stay creative is to keep moving forward.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clean-up-your-sleep-hygiene\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#clean-up-your-sleep-hygiene\" aria-label=\"clean up your sleep hygiene permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Clean up Your Sleep Hygiene</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid working or watching television in bed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid caffeine after noon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SIDE EFFECTS FROM MISSING SLEEP</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Irritability</li>\n<li>Cognitive impairment</li>\n<li>Memory lapses or loss</li>\n<li>Impaired moral judgement</li>\n<li>Decreased creativity - Increased stress</li>\n<li>Symptoms similar to ADHD</li>\n<li>Impaired immune system</li>\n<li>Risk of diabetes Type 2</li>\n<li>Decreased testosterone</li>\n<li>Increased heart rate variability</li>\n<li>Risk of heart disease and stroke</li>\n<li>Increased reaction time</li>\n<li>Decreased accuracy</li>\n<li>Tremors</li>\n<li>Aches</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Growth suppression - Risk of obesity</li>\n<li>Decreased temperature</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It all starts with caffeine.</strong> The first tip for cleaning up your sleep hygiene is perhaps the most  straightforward method. It’s also the most important. For most people, this tip has the potential to have a bigger impact than any other action. The catch?

You can sleep longer and vastly improve the quality of the sleep you get by reducing your caffeine intake and adjusting the timing of your consumption.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As discussed in the chapter on beating stress, drinking too much caffeine can also alter your emotional intelligence because caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline, the source of the “fight or flight” response.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SIDE EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Central</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Irritability</li>\n<li>Anxiety</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-Restlessness</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Confusion</li>\n<li>Delirium</li>\n<li>Headache</li>\n<li>Insomnia</li>\n<li><strong>Sleep deprivation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Muscular</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trembling</li>\n<li>Twitching</li>\n<li>Overextension</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Respiratory</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid breathing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Urinary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frequent urination</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Visual</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seeing flashes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ears</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ringing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Systemic</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dehydration</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skin</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased sensitivity to touch or pain</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid heartbeat</li>\n<li>Irregular rhythm</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gastric</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abdominal pain</li>\n<li>Nausea</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stay away from sleeping pills.</strong> Sleeping pills are anything you take that sedates you so that you can sleep. Whether it’s alcohol, Nyquil, Benadryl, Valium, Ambien, or what have you, these substances greatly disrupt your brain’s natural sleep process. As you sleep and your brain removes harmful toxins, it cycles through an elaborate series of stages. Sedation interferes with these stages, which has dire consequences for the quality of your sleep. Therefore, many of the habits in this chapter eliminate factors that disrupt your sleep quality. If reducing your use of sleeping pills is difficult, try some of the other habits (such as cutting down on caffeine and reducing blue light in the evening) that will make it easier for you to fall asleep naturally and reduce your dependence on sedatives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Avoid blue light at night.</strong> This is a big one-most people don’t even realize it impacts their sleep. Short-wavelength blue light plays an important role in your mood, energy level, and sleep quality. In the morning, sunlight contains high concentrations of this “blue” light. When your eyes are exposed to it directly (not through a window or while wearing sunglasses), blue light halts production of the sleep- inducing hormone melatonin and makes you feel more alert. This is great, and exposure to morning sunlight can improve your mood and energy levels. If the sun isn’t an option for you, try a blue-light therapy lamp.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Turn off devices with screens 2 hours before bedtime or block blue waves with special glasses or a blue-wave blocker app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Eliminate interruptions.</strong> Unfortunately for those with small children, the quality of your sleep suffers when it’s interrupted. The key is to eliminate all interruptions that are under your control. If you have loud neighbors, wear earplugs to bed. If your mother likes to call at all hours of the night, silence your phone’s ringer before you go to bed. If you have to wake up early one morning, make sure your alarm clock is back on its regular time when you go to bed. Don’t drink too much water in the evening to avoid a bathroom trip in the middle of the night. If you think hard enough, there are lots of little things you can do to eliminate unnecessary sleep interruptions. You just have to prepare for them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Learn how much sleep you really need.</strong> The amount of sleep you need is something that you can’t control, and scientists are beginning to discover the genes that dictate it. The problem is that most people sleep much less than they really need and are underperforming because they think they’re getting enough. Some discover this the hard way. Ariana Huffington was one of those frantic types who under slept and overworked until she collapsed unexpectedly from exhaustion one afternoon. She credited her success and well-being since then to the changes she made in her sleep habits. “I began getting 30 minutes more sleep a night, until gradually I got to 7 to 8 hours. The result has been transformational,” Huffington said, adding that “all the science now demonstrates unequivocally that when we get enough sleep, everything is better: our health; our mental capacity and clarity; our joy at life; and our ability to live life without reacting to every bad thing that happens.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Learn to meditate.</strong> Many people who learn to meditate report that it improves the quality of their sleep and that they can get the rest they need even if they aren’t able to significantly increase the number of hours they sleep. At the Stanford Medical Center, insomniacs participated in a six-week mindfulness meditation and cognitive-behavioral therapy course. At the end of the study, participants’ average time to fall asleep was cut in half (from 40 to 20 minutes), and 60% of the subjects no longer qualified as insomniacs. The subjects retained these gains upon follow-up a full year later. A similar study at the University of Massachusetts Medical School found that 91% of participants either reduced the amount of medication they needed to sleep or stopped taking medication entirely after a mindfulness and sleep therapy course. Give mindfulness a try. At the minimum, you’ll fall asleep faster, as it will teach you how to relax and quiet your mind once you hit the pillow. The chapter on mindfulness will show you how.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stop working.</strong> When you work in the evening, it puts you in a stimulated, alert state when you should be winding down and relaxing in preparation for sleep. Recent surveys showed that roughly 60% of people monitor their smartphones for work emails until they go to sleep. Staying off blue light-emitting devices (discussed above) after a certain time each evening is also a great way to avoid working so you can relax and prepare for sleep, but any type of work before bed should be avoided if you want quality sleep.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wake up at the same time every day.</strong> Consistency is key to a good night’s sleep, especially when it comes to waking up. Waking up at the same time every day improves your mood and sleep quality by regulating your circadian rhythm. When you have a consistent wake-up time, your brain acclimates to it and moves through the sleep cycle in preparation for you to feel rested and alert at your wake-up time. Roughly an hour before you wake, hormone levels increase gradually (along with your body temperature and blood pressure), causing you to become more alert. This is why you’ll often find yourself waking up right before your alarm goes off.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you don’t wake up at the same time every day, your brain doesn’t know when to complete the sleep process and when it should prepare you to be awake. Long ago, sunlight ensured a consistent wake-up time. These days, an alarm is the only way most people can pull this off. Doing this successfully requires resisting the temptation to sleep in, because you know you’ll actually feel better by keeping your wake-up time intact. If you don’t, you’ll often end up feeling groggy and tired, because your brain hasn’t prepared your body to be awake. This isn’t a big deal on your day off, but it makes you less productive on Monday, because it throws your cycle off and makes it hard to get going again on your regular schedule.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When all else fails, take naps.</strong> One of the biggest peaks in melatonin production occurs during the 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. timeframe, which explains why most people feel sleepy in the afternoon. Companies like Google and Zappos are capitalizing on this need by giving employees the opportunity to take short afternoon naps. If you aren’t getting enough sleep at night, you’re likely going to feel an</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>overwhelming desire to sleep in the afternoon. When this happens, you’re better off taking a short nap (even as short as 15 minutes) than resorting to caffeine to keep you awake. A short nap will give you the rest you need to get through the rest of the afternoon, and you’ll sleep much better in the evening than if you drink caffeine or take a long afternoon nap.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sleep naked.</strong> What if I told you that in just 10 seconds a day you could sleep better and lose weight? All you have to do is take off your clothes. None of the other nine strategies for improving your sleep is as simple and some are less effective as stripping down before you go to sleep. As only 8% of people sleep naked, most people can discover the benefits of sleeping in the buff. This may sound far-fetched, but hear me out before you throw those cozy flannel pajamas on. Researchers at the University of Amsterdam found that lowering your skin temperature increases the depth of your sleep and reduces the number of times you wake up at night. Stripping down to your birthday suit is a great way to lower your skin temperature without changing the temperature of the room. A study conducted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health found that keeping yourself cool while you sleep speeds the body’s metabolism because your body creates more brown fat to keep you warm. Brown fat produces heat by burning calories (300 times more heat than any organ in the body), and this boosts your metabolism all day to help you lose weight. In addition to the metabolic effects of sleeping in the buff, removing your clothes improves your blood circulation, which is good for your heart and muscles. The quality sleep you’ll enjoy also increases the release of growth hormone and melatonin, both of which have anti-aging benefits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"control-your-anger\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#control-your-anger\" aria-label=\"control your anger permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Control Your Anger</h3>\n<h4 id=\"putting-away-the-funnel\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#putting-away-the-funnel\" aria-label=\"putting away the funnel permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>PUTTING AWAY THE FUNNEL</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The question we all need to ask ourselves is not, “Do I funnel my emotions into anger?” Rather, it’s, “When, where, and how do I funnel my emotions into anger?” Turning off the anger funnel is really a matter of educating yourself on the sources of your anger. Only by breaking down and understanding the real emotions you funnel into anger can you understand yourself well enough to catch yourself the next time you’re about to get angry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Emotions are often funneled into anger in an instant. It’s unrealistic to assume that you’ll stop yourself every time you’re about to pour your emotions into the funnel. Instead, you can turn off your anger as soon as it’s aroused by asking yourself three simple questions. To help illustrate, I’ve put my own answers to these questions from an incident in which I was abruptly cut off by another car on the freeway.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Question 1: Why am I angry?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The answer to this question usually involves finger-pointing. That’s OK, as it’s part of the process. Usually, something or someone around you helped you begin moving toward anger. In my case, my answer was, “I’m angry because that car almost ran me off the road.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Question 2: How did this incident really make me feel?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You might also call this question, “What was the feeling that I funneled into anger?” As long as you’re willing to feel vulnerable, the answer to this question should come pretty easily. In my case, the answer was obvious: fear. Getting cut off like that made me feel intense fear. The fear was so intense that a fuming, smoke-out-my-ears anger came out the other side of the funnel. I knew it was time to ask myself these three questions, as opposed to giving in to the thought of teaching the guy a lesson. My anger was like a big red balloon that was going to pop, but as soon as I realized this anger was a substitute for fear, it sent all of the air rushing out of the balloon. I went from shocked that I couldn’t get the car in front of me out of my mind to shocked that anger that intense could simply evaporate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Question 3: Why was this feeling so intolerable?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>By the time you get to question 3, your anger will have largely subsided. In my case, the whole thing felt silly by this point. I felt silly for being so angry and silly for being so vulnerable to fear. So, I asked myself, why was I afraid? I’ve been driving for decades here in Southern California, where getting cut off is a regular occurrence. So, why did this time get me going? The answer is that when this happened I was a new father. My drive to remain safe and be there for my son magnified my fear. What was really intolerable was the thought of not being there for him. Learning why the feeling is so intolerable improves your self-awareness, so that you’re less likely to use that funnel the next time someone inevitably cuts you off.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"perfectionism-feeds-anger\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#perfectionism-feeds-anger\" aria-label=\"perfectionism feeds anger permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>PERFECTIONISM FEEDS ANGER</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You get defensive when receiving feedback.</strong> Perfectionists care deeply about what other people think of them, and this can make feedback hard to take. Even well-presented, useful feedback feels like a needle to the eye. You likely catch yourself acting defensively before you realize that you’re taking issue with the feedback. It’s a knee-jerk reaction. As a perfectionist, you naturally have an intense desire to succeed. Take comfort in the fact that feedback (even brutal feedback) ultimately helps you improve. Take it in stride, and feedback will actually help you get closer to perfection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>However, you’re critical of others.</strong> Considering their inability to receive criticism, perfectionists can certainly dish it out. Perfectionists can’t help but measure themselves against other people, so taking someone down a notch, especially if that person is a threat, feels good. However, this isn’t always the reason. Perfectionists are also critical of others because they compare them to the same unobtainable standard to which they compare themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You recognize that your perfectionism is a problem, but you think that’s what it takes to be successful.</strong> Sometimes, you really need to push yourself hard to be successful. When your perfectionism gets out of control, using hard work as a justification for the unnecessary pain and suffering you endure is easy. Make no mistake about it-perfectionism creates unnecessary struggle and strife. When you get your perfectionism under control, you can work less and get more done.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You procrastinate all the time.</strong> Perfectionism and fear of failure go hand in hand. This combination leads to procrastination, because even mundane tasks are intimidating when they must be completed perfectly. Most writers spend countless hours brainstorming characters and plot, and they even write page after page that they know they’ll never include in their book. They do this because they know that ideas need time to develop. We tend to freeze up when it’s time to get started because we know that our ideas aren’t perfect and that what we produce might not be any good. However, how can you ever produce something great if you don’t get started and give your ideas time to evolve? Author Jodi Picoult summarized the importance of avoiding perfectionism perfectly: “You can edit a bad page, but you can’t edit a blank page.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You have a guilty conscience.</strong> Perfectionists have a steady stream of guilty thoughts running through their minds because they’re always feeling like they’re coming up short. This guilt elevates stress and frustration and can easily spiral into depression and anxiety.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You take mistakes personally.</strong> Perfectionists take things so seriously that they tend to overestimate the impact of their mistakes. Minor events can cause them to experience bitter disappointment. This issue is significant because it makes you less resilient, and the ability to bounce back from failure is critical to success. Perfectionists must learn that failure is not a confirmation that they aren’t good enough.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You take pleasure in other people’s failures.</strong> This little-known secret of perfectionists is not as evil as it sounds. Misery loves company, and perfectionists can’t help but find satisfaction in knowing that other people experience the same frustrations they do. These moments of relief are short-lived, and they make perfectionists feel bad for being so competitive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You’re afraid to take risks.</strong> With the fear of failure comes the fear of taking risks. Perfectionists’ hard work, research, and attention to detail produce novel ideas. Unfortunately, their great ideas are often placed on the back burner because of their fear of risk. The only way to get comfortable with taking risks is to take them. Starting the process is never easy, but by actively leaning into the very things that make you uncomfortable, you build up your confidence and realize that it’s never as bad as you build it up in your mind to be.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You live in fear of rejection.</strong> Perfectionists need the approval of others to feel successful. This mentality leads to a crippling fear of rejection. Perfectionists dread certain things, such as asking for a raise or pursuing their passions in lieu of something that will win approval from others. Living in fear of rejection feels terrible, stifles creativity, and slows down your progression as a person. Whenever you find yourself overly concerned with what other people think of you, remember this famous take on authenticity (commonly misattributed to Dr. Seuss): “Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Only Get Mad on Purpose</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t let your anger control you.

Keep an eye out for the following signs, and you can use your emotional intelligence to ensure you won’t be taken advantage of by a liar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They repeat themselves and provide too much detail.</strong> Liars hate silence, so they often try to fill it up by talking more than they need to. They provide far more information than needed or asked for. Sometimes, the longer you stay quiet, the more details liars throw in to support their story as they try to convince you and themselves of their deception. Liars also repeat phrases over and over again as they struggle to buy time to gather their thoughts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They cover their mouths.</strong> People often cover their mouths when lying. A hand on the mouth or even a touch of the lips shows you that they may be lying, because this unconscious body language represents a closing off of communication. When lying, people also instinctively cover vulnerable body parts, such as the head, neck, or abdomen, because lying makes them feel exposed, vulnerable, and open to attack.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They prepare for an escape.</strong> In an unconscious attempt to find an escape route, people who are lying often angle their bodies toward the door if they’re sitting, and they may even move closer to the door if they’re standing. They may also change their posture from relaxed to erect or guarded as their bodies perk up in unconscious preparation for an escape.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They fidget.</strong> Fidgeting is a clear sign of nervous energy. Even practiced liars worry that you won’t believe them, so they release that nervous energy by playing with their hair, tapping their feet or fingers, pulling on their ears, and more. Shuffling the feet is a common expression of nervous energy associated with lying. Their feet start moving because the liar feels vulnerable, and their body wants to flee.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Their breathing changes.</strong> People reflexively start breathing more heavily when they lie, as lying causes changes in their heart rate and blood flow. Sometimes, liars even have trouble speaking, as the mucous membranes in their mouth dry out as part of their body’s response to lying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Their words and body language don’t match.</strong> It’s easy to lie with words, but our bodies know (and show) the truth. A clear sign that someone is lying to you is when their words are saying one thing, and their body language is saying something entirely different. For example, someone is telling you a sad story about the personal struggles that made them miss work, yet they’re smiling while they’re talking, and their hand gestures and body posture are animated and excited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They change their typical eye movement patterns.</strong> They say that the eyes are the “windows to the soul.” That’s especially true when someone is lying. But there’s a catch: It’s not where the person is looking that matters, but the change in direction. Some people, for instance, look up and to the right when they’re remembering information, but down when they’re lying. For other people, it’s the opposite. A change in eye movement can be a very strong indicator of lying, but you have to know the person’s typical pattern first. That makes this tactic more suitable to use with people you know well, or at least interact with regularly. However, one eye movement “tell” is pretty universal: People who are lying often look toward the door, their unconscious escape route.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They get aggressive.</strong> Liars often get aggressive in a conversation for no apparent reason. Sometimes, they become hostile and point aggressively in your direction. Other times, liars maintain excessive eye contact without blinking, in an abrasive attempt to appear truthful. If someone’s aggression is making you uncomfortable, and they seem to be lying, they probably are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Before rushing to conclusions about someone you think might be lying, be certain to consider what constitutes normal behavior for them. The indicators I’ve mentioned have meaning only in the context of a person’s typical behavior. If your friend has ADHD and fidgets constantly, you can’t take their fidgeting as a sign of lying. Some people, such as psychopaths, don’t demonstrate these behaviors because they don’t feel nervous or guilty about lying.

Know the severity of the consequences for lying (if in a setting such as the workplace), and make certain you follow the proper protocol for addressing it, or calling the liar out could backfire on you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Option 1: Do nothing.</strong> Nobody likes being lied to, and the natural reaction is to call the liar out, but that’s not always the smartest thing to do. Before you do anything, ask yourself, “What’s at stake besides my ego?” Carefully weigh the pros and cons before you act. Consider who, if anyone, should know about the lie and the implications for them. Sometimes, the animosity you avoid by staying silent is worth more than the satisfaction you receive from speaking out. This is especially true with smaller lies. At other times, the lie is serious enough that people have to know.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Option 2: Deflect with humor.</strong> Some lies are too big to ignore completely but too small to make a big deal out of. When this happens, you can always make a joke about it. Playful comments that acknowledge the lie usually do the trick: “Hey, I think I just saw your nose grow a little bit” or “I need to get my prescription checked. When I looked at the scorecard, it said you shot 112.” This strategy gives the liar a chance to admit their slip-up without fear of reprisal. The key to making this tactic work is to give the impression that the other person was kidding around or intentionally exaggerating and never expected to be believed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Option 3: Play dumb.</strong> Another way to let someone save face and this is particularly appropriate for group settings-is to play dumb. Pretend you suddenly suffered a memory lapse or are confused about the facts. Ask lots of follow-up questions. The more details you request, the more likely the truth will come out. Drawing it out gives the liar a chance to admit that they “misspoke” and correct themselves without being called a liar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Option 4: Call them on it.</strong> In situations where doing nothing isn’t a good option, you can always call the liar out. You just need to think carefully about the best way to do this. Impulsively bashing them is never a smart move. You may choose to have a private conversation with the liar or with others affected by the lie. In either case, it’s important to have evidence that backs up your claim, or you may be called a liar. Make certain you are honest and direct with the person who lied. Don’t go to others with the lie when you know it’s better handled privately between you and the liar.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many times, calling out a lie is the right thing to do, both ethically and practically. Sometimes, not reporting a lie can cost you your job. However, you need to think about a few things before you take that step. First, question your motives. Are you thinking about telling someone about the lie out of concern that they or someone else could be harmed, or are you just mad? If it’s the latter, you run the risk of making yourself look petty. If it’s the former, stick to the facts. Don’t offer any hypotheses about why the person may be lying, because that’s just supposition on your part. Stick to what the person said, what the truth is, and any proof you’ve collected.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Not optional: Protect yourself.</strong> Whether you decide to call out a lie or to let it go, once you know you’re dealing with a liar, take steps to protect yourself, especially at work. One way to do this is to have a witness attest to what the liar said. Failing this, interact with the liar via email or text, both of which create a written record. However, if you’re dealing with a particularly savvy liar, they’re not going to commit to anything in writing. In that case, document the conversation yourself: who, what, when, where, etc. Cap it off by sending your lying colleague an email summarizing the conversation. That’s not as good as having proof in the other person’s words, but at least you’ll be able to make the argument that your colleague had the opportunity to correct you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"relationship-management-strategies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#relationship-management-strategies\" aria-label=\"relationship management strategies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Relationship Management Strategies</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ability to use your awareness of your own and others’ emotions to manage interactions successfully.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"neutralize-toxic-people\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#neutralize-toxic-people\" aria-label=\"neutralize toxic people permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>neutralize toxic people</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>emotional manipulators are easy enough to spot if you know what to look for.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They undermine your faith in your grasp of reality.</strong> Emotional manipulators are incredibly skilled liars and gaslighters. They insist that an incident didn’t happen when it did, and they insist they did or said something when they didn’t. The trouble is, they’re so good at it that you end up questioning your own sanity. Insisting that whatever caused the problem is a figment of your imagination is an extremely powerful way of getting out of a jam. Their utter confidence in the lie makes you question your own perception of events. They are an emotional black hole. Whatever emotional manipulators are feeling, they’re geniuses at sucking everyone around them into those emotions. If they’re in a bad mood, everyone around them knows it. But that’s not the worst part: They’re so skillful that not only is everyone aware of their mood, but they also feel it. This creates a tendency for people to feel responsible for the manipulator’s moods and obligated to fix them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They are experts at doling out guilt.</strong> Emotional manipulators are masters at leveraging your guilt to their advantage. If you bring up something that’s bothering you, they make you feel guilty for mentioning it. If you don’t mention it, they make you feel guilty for keeping it to yourself and stewing about it. When you’re dealing with emotional manipulators, whatever you do is wrong, and no matter what problems the two of you are having, they’re your fault.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They claim the role of the victim.</strong> When it comes to emotional manipulators, nothing is ever their fault. No matter what they do (or fail to do) it’s someone else’s fault. Someone else made them do it and usually, it’s you. If you get mad or upset, it’s your fault for having unreasonable expectations. If they get mad, it’s your fault for upsetting them. Emotional manipulators don’t take accountability for anything.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Their actions don’t match their words.</strong> Emotional manipulators tell you what you want to hear, but their actions are another story. They pledge their support, but when it’s time to follow through, they act as though your requests are completely unreasonable. They tell you how lucky they are to know you, and then act as though you’re a burden. This is just another way of undermining your belief in your own sanity. They make you question reality as you see it and mold your perception according to what is convenient to them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They are too much, too soon.</strong> Whether it’s a personal relationship or a business relationship, emotional manipulators always seem to skip a few steps. They share too much too soon and expect the same from you. They appear vulnerable and sensitive, but it’s a ruse. The charade is intended to make you feel “special” for being let into their inner circle, but it’s also intended to make you feel not just sorry for them but also responsible for their feelings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They eagerly agree to help-and maybe even volunteer-and then act like martyrs</strong>. An initial eagerness to help swiftly morphs into sighs, groans, and suggestions that whatever they agreed to do is a huge burden. If you shine a spotlight on that reluctance, they’ll turn it around on you, assuring you that, of course, they want to help and that you’re just being paranoid. The goal? To make you feel guilty, indebted, and maybe even crazy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>They always one-up you.</strong> No matter what problems you may have, emotional manipulators have it worse. They undermine the legitimacy of your complaints by reminding you that their problems are more serious. The message? You have no reason to complain, so shut the heck up.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>They know all your buttons and don’t hesitate to push them.</strong> Emotional manipulators know your weak spots, and they’re quick to use that knowledge against you. If you’re insecure about your weight, they comment on what you eat or the way your clothes fit. If you’re worried about an upcoming presentation, they point out how intimidating and judgmental the attendees are. Their awareness of your emotions is off the charts, but they use it to manipulate you, not to make you feel better.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-nine-toxic-types\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-nine-toxic-types\" aria-label=\"the nine toxic types permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE NINE TOXIC TYPES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Gossip</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eleanor Roosevelt famously said, “Great minds discuss ideas, average ones discuss events, and small minds discuss people.” Gossipers derive pleasure from other people’s misfortunes. It might be fun at first to discuss somebody else’s personal or professional misfortune, but over time, it gets tiring, makes you feel gross, and hurts other people. There are too many positives out there and too much to learn from interesting people to waste your time talking about the misfortunes of others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Victim</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Victims are tough to identify because you initially empathize with their problems. However, as time passes, you begin to realize that their “time of need” is all the time. Victims actively push away any personal responsibility by making every speed bump they encounter into an uncrossable mountain. They don’t see tough times as opportunities to learn and grow from; instead, they see them as an out. There’s an old saying: “Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.” It perfectly captures the toxicity of the victim, who chooses to suffer every time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Arrogant</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arrogant people are a waste of your time because they see everything you do as a personal challenge. Arrogance is false confidence, and it always masks major insecurities. Arrogant people tend to be lower performers, be more disagreeable, and have more cognitive problems than the average person. Arrogant people can be completely self-absorbed, and they bring you down through the impassionate distance they maintain from other people. You can usually tell when you’re hanging around self-absorbed people because you start to feel completely alone. This happens because as far as they’re concerned, there’s no point in having a real connection with anyone else. You’re merely a tool used to build their self-esteem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Envious</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To envious people, the grass is always greener somewhere else. Even when something great happens to envious people, they don’t derive any satisfaction from it. That’s because they measure their fortune against the world’s when they should be deriving their satisfaction from within. And let’s face it, there’s always someone out there who’s doing better if you look hard enough. Spending too much time around envious people is dangerous because they teach you to trivialize your own accomplishments.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Manipulator</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manipulators suck time and energy out of your life under the façade of friendship. They can be tricky to deal with because they treat you like a friend. They know what you like, what makes you happy, and what you think is funny. However, they use this information as part of a hidden agenda. Manipulators always want something from you, and if you look back on your relationships with them, it’s all take, take, take, with little or no giving. They’ll do anything to win you over, just so they can work you over.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Dementor</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In J. K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series, Dementors are evil creatures that suck people’s souls out of their bodies, leaving them shells of humans. Whenever a Dementor enters the room, it goes dark, people get cold, and they begin to recall their worst memories. Rowling said that she based them on highly negative people—the kind of people who have the ability to walk into a room and instantly suck the life out of it. Dementors suck the life out of the room by imposing their negativity and pessimism on everyone they encounter. Their viewpoints are always “the glass is half empty,” and they can inject fear and concern into even the most benign situations. A Notre Dame University study found that students assigned to roommates who thought negatively were far more likely to develop negative thinking and even depression themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Temperamental</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some people have absolutely no control over their emotions. They lash out at you and project their feelings onto you, all the while thinking that you’re the one causing their malaise. Temperamental people are tough to dump from your life because their lack of control over their emotions makes you feel bad for them. When push comes to shove, though, temperamental people will use you as their emotional toilet and should be avoided.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Twisted</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are certain toxic people who have bad intentions, deriving deep satisfaction from the pain and misery of others. They are out to hurt you, to make you feel bad, or to get something from you. Otherwise, they have no interest in you. The only good thing about this type is that you can spot their intentions quickly, which makes it that much faster to get them out of your life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Judgmental</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Judgmental people are quick to tell you exactly what is and isn’t cool. They have a way of taking the thing you’re most passionate about and making you feel terrible about it. Instead of appreciating and learning from people who are different from them, judgmental people look down on others. Judgmental people stifle your desire to be passionate and expressive, so you’re best off cutting them out and being yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"how-to-protect-yourself-from-toxic-people\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-protect-yourself-from-toxic-people\" aria-label=\"how to protect yourself from toxic people permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM TOXIC PEOPLE</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Set limits (especially with complainers).</strong> Complainers and negative people are bad news because they swallow in their problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want others to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to complainers because they don’t want to be seen as callous or rude, but there’s a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into their negative emotional spiral. You can avoid this only by setting limits and distancing yourself when necessary. One way to set a limit is to ask complainers how they intend to fix the problem. They will either quiet down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t die in the fight.</strong> People with high EQ know how important it is to live to fight another day, especially when your foe is a toxic individual. In conflict, unchecked emotion makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle that can leave you severely damaged. When you read and respond to your emotions, you’re able to choose your battles wisely and stand your ground only when the time is right.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stay aware of your emotions.</strong> Maintaining emotional distance requires awareness. You can’t stop someone from pushing your buttons if you don’t recognize when it’s happening. Sometimes, you’ll find yourself in situations in which you’ll need to regroup and choose the best way forward. This is fine, and you shouldn’t be afraid to buy yourself some time to do so. Think of it this way-if a mentally unstable person approaches you on the street and tells you he’s John F. Kennedy, you’re unlikely to set him straight. When you find yourself with a coworker who is engaged in similarly derailed thinking, sometimes it’s best to just smile and nod. If you’re going to have to straighten them out, it’s better to give yourself some time to plan the best way to go about it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rise above.</strong> Toxic people drive you crazy because their behavior is so irrational. Make no mistake about it; their behavior truly goes against reason. So, why do you allow yourself to respond to them emotionally and get sucked into the mix? The more irrational and off- base someone is, the easier it should be for you to remove yourself from their traps. Quit trying to beat them at their own game. You don’t need to respond to the emotional chaos-only the facts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Establish boundaries.</strong> People feel like because they work or live with someone, they have no way to control the chaos. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Once you find someone’s behavior more predictable and easier to understand, you are equipped to think rationally about when and where you have to put up with them and when you don’t. For example, even if you work closely with someone on a project team, you don’t need to have the same level of one-on- one interaction with them you have with your other team members. You can establish a boundary, but you’ll have to do it consciously and proactively. If you let things happen naturally, you’re bound to find yourself constantly embroiled in difficult conversations. If you set boundaries and decide when and where you’ll engage a difficult person, you can control much of the chaos. The only trick is to stick to your guns and keep boundaries in place when the person tries to encroach upon them which they will.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t focus on problems-only solutions.</strong> Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems you’re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and reduces stress. When it comes to toxic people, fixating on how crazy and difficult they are gives them power over you. Quit thinking about how troubling your difficult person is, and focus instead on how you’re going to handle them. This makes you more effective by putting you in control, and it will reduce the amount of stress you experience when interacting with them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t forget.</strong> Emotionally intelligent people are quick to forgive, but that doesn’t mean that they forget. Forgiveness requires letting go of what’s happened so that you can move on. It doesn’t mean you’ll give a wrongdoer another chance. Emotionally intelligent people are unwilling to be bogged down unnecessarily by others’ mistakes, so they let them go quickly and are assertive in protecting themselves from future harm.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use your support system.</strong> It’s tempting but ineffective to try to tackle everything by yourself. To deal with toxic people, you need to recognize the weaknesses in your approach to them. This means tapping into your support system to gain perspective on a challenging person. Everyone has someone who is on their team, rooting for them, and ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Identify these individuals in your life and seek their insight and assistance when you need it. Something as simple as explaining the situation can lead to a new perspective. Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can’t because they are not as emotionally invested in the situation as you are.</p>\n<h3 id=\"master-conflict\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#master-conflict\" aria-label=\"master conflict permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Master Conflict</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The secret to effectively handling conflict is assertiveness-that delicate place where you get your needs met without bullying the other person into submission. Assertive people operate in the small space that lies between passivity and aggression (that is, they never</li>\n</ul>\n<p>lean too far in either direction). It’s easy to think that nice people are too passive. Although that’s often true, unchecked passivity can boil over into aggression. So, there are plenty of very nice people out there who have exhibited both extremes of the assertiveness spectrum. To be assertive, you need to learn to engage in healthy conflict. Healthy conflict directly and constructively addresses the issue at hand without ignoring or trivializing the needs of either party. The following habits will help you handle conflict assertively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consider the repercussions of silence.</strong> Sometimes, it’s hard to muster the motivation to speak up when the likelihood is high that things will turn ugly. The fastest way to motivate yourself to act is to fully consider the costs of not speaking up-they’re typically far greater than standing up for yourself. The trick is that you need to shift your attention from the headache that will come with getting involved to the things you stand to gain from your assertiveness.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ask good questions until you get to the heart of the matter.</strong> Failing to understand the motive behind someone’s behavior throws fuel on the fire of conflict, because it makes everything they do appear foolish and shortsighted. Instead of pointing out flaws, you should seek to understand where the other person is coming from. Try asking good questions, such as, “Why did you choose to do it that way?” “What do you mean by that?” “Can you help me understand this better?” Even when you don’t see eye to eye, using questions to get at the underlying motive builds trust and understanding, both of which are conflict killers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When you challenge, offer solutions.</strong> People don’t like it when they feel as if you’re attempting to take apart their idea right off the bat. When you challenge someone’s idea but also offer a solution, you demonstrate that you want to work together to come up with a solution. This reinforces the value of their idea, even if it’s full of holes. For example, you might say, “One potential problem that I see with your idea is <em>However, I think we can overcome this problem if we can just figure out a way to</em>___.” In this example, you aren’t even providing the solution. You’re just acknowledging that you’re willing to work together to find one.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Say “and” instead of “but.”</strong> The simple act of replacing the word “but” with “and” makes conflict much more constructive and collaborative. Say, for example, that your teammate John wants to use the majority of your budget on a marketing campaign, but you’re worried that won’t leave enough money for a critical new hire. Instead of saying, “I see that you want to use the money for marketing, but I think we need to make a new hire,” say, “I see that you want to use the money for marketing, and I think we need to make a new hire.” The difference is subtle, but the first sentence minimizes the value of his idea. The second sentence states the problem as you see it, without devaluing his idea, which then opens things up for discussion. Saying “and” makes the other party feel like you’re working with them, rather than against them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use hypotheticals.</strong> When you assert yourself, you don’t want it to look like you’re poking holes in their idea (even when you are). Hypotheticals are the perfect way to pull this off. Telling someone, for example, “Your new product idea won’t work because you overlooked how the sales team operates” comes across much more aggressively than suggesting the hypothetical, “How do you think our sales team will go about selling this new product?” When you see a flaw and present a hypothetical, you’re engaging with the original idea and giving the other party a chance to explain how it might work. This shows that you’re willing to hear the other person out.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-five-mistakes-that-derail-assertiveness\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-five-mistakes-that-derail-assertiveness\" aria-label=\"the five mistakes that derail assertiveness permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>THE FIVE MISTAKES THAT DERAIL ASSERTIVENESS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mistake 1: Being Brutally Honest</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’ve suffered in silence long enough. Your colleague continues to park so close to your car that you have to enter through the passenger door. You’ve asked them to stop. After half a dozen more violations, you decide to do something about it. Clearly, they need to know what you think of their intentional disrespect. So you let them have it. You go right up to them and tell them what an inconsiderate jerk they are.</li>\n<li><strong>How to beat this? Honesty without brutality.</strong> From a young age, we’re taught that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend that the only options are brutality or harmony. With emotional intelligence, you can speak the truth without burning a bridge. Have you ever noticed how some conversations-even ones about very risky subjects go very well? And others, even those about trivial things, can degenerate into combat? The antidote to conflict is not diluting your message. It’s creating safety. Many people think the content of the conversation is what makes people defensive, so they assume it’s best to just go for it and be brutally honest. It isn’t. People don’t get defensive because of the content-they get defensive because of the intent they perceive behind it. It isn’t the truth that hurts—it’s the malice used to deliver the truth. When you remove your emotions from your message, you can be honest without being brutal. In this case telling your colleague that you’ve asked them before not to park so close to your car, that they continue to do so, that it’s a major inconvenience for you, and that you’d like them to stop is bound to get their attention and doesn’t require an ounce of malice.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mistake 2: Robotically Sharing Your Feelings</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some well-intentioned “communication” professionals suggest that when it’s time to speak up, the diplomatic way to do so is to start by sharing your feelings. For example, you tell your parking-impaired colleague, “I feel rage and disgust.” Somehow, that’s supposed to help. It doesn’t. People don’t work this way. Robotically sharing your feelings only alienates, annoys, and confuses them.</li>\n<li><strong>How to beat this? Start with the facts.</strong> Our brains often serve us poorly during difficult conversations. To maximize cognitive efficiency, our minds store feelings and conclusions, but not the facts that created them. That’s why, when you give your colleague negative feedback and they ask for an example, you often hem and haw. You truly can’t remember. So you repeat your feelings or conclusions, but offer few helpful facts. Gathering the facts beforehand is the homework required to master conflict. Before opening your mouth, think through the basic information that helped you think or feel the way you do and prepare to share it first.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mistake 3: Defending Your Position</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When someone takes an opposing view on a topic you care deeply about, the natural human response is “defense.” Our brains are hardwired to assess for threats, but when we let feelings of being threatened hijack our behavior, things never end well. In conflict, getting defensive is a surefire path to failure.</li>\n<li><strong>How to beat this? Get curious.</strong> A great way to inoculate yourself against defensiveness is to develop a healthy doubt about your own certainty. Then, enter the conversation with intense curiosity about the other person’s world. Give yourself the detective’s task of discovering why a reasonable, rational, and decent person would think the way they do. As former Secretary of State Dean Rusk said, “The best way to persuade others is with your ears, by listening.” When others feel deeply understood, they become far more open to hearing you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mistake 4: Blaming Others for Your Situation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your boss tells you they’ll go to bat for you for a promotion. You hear later that in the HR review they advocated for your colleague instead. You feel betrayed and angry. Certainly, your boss is the one responsible for your pain-right? The truth is, they’re not the only one.</li>\n<li><strong>How to beat this? Challenge your perspective.</strong> When we feel threatened, we amplify our negative emotions by blaming others for our problems. Remember the anger funnel? You won’t master conflict until you recognize the role you’ve played in creating your circumstances. Your boss may have passed you over, but they did so for a reason. Half your pain is the result of their betrayal; the other half is due to your disappointment over not performing well enough to win the promotion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mistake 5: Talking Yourself Out of Speaking Up</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s easy for conflict to fill you with dread. Under the influence of such stress, your negative self-talk takes over, and you obsess over all the bad things that might happen if you speak up. You conjure up images of conflict, retribution, isolation, and pain until you retreat into silence.</li>\n<li><strong>How to beat this? Quantify the risks of not speaking up.</strong> The fastest way to motivate yourself to step up to difficult conversations is to simply articulate the costs of not speaking up. People who consistently speak up aren’t necessarily more courageous; they’re simply more accurate. First, they scrupulously review what’s likely to happen if they fail to speak up. Second, they ponder what might happen if they speak up and things go well. Finally (the order is important), they consider what may happen if the conversation goes poorly. Once they have an accurate understanding of the possibilities, saying something is their typical choice. The reward usually outweighs the risk.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"blunders-that-lead-to-virtual-conflict\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#blunders-that-lead-to-virtual-conflict\" aria-label=\"blunders that lead to virtual conflict permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>BLUNDERS THAT LEAD TO VIRTUAL CONFLICT</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Typing a message that comes across just like you do in person is a fine art. During a conversation, you adjust your tone, facial expression, gestures, and posture to fit the mood of what you’re conveying. You do this because people tend to be much more responsive to how you say things than to what you actually say.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Text strips a conversation bare. It’s efficient, but it turns otherwise easy interactions into messy misinterpretations. Without facial expressions and body posture to guide your message, people look at each word you type as an indicator of tone and mood. Most of the mistakes people make in their electronic messages are completely avoidable. The following bad habits lead to subtle mistakes and hidden blunders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Way-Too-Brief</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All too often, the cause of a virtual conflict is an imbalance between the effort in the initial message and the effort in the response to that message. When someone types up a detailed paragraph outlining important issues, they expect you to respond carefully. Sending back “Got it” or “Noted” just doesn’t do the trick. Without knowledge of your intent and tone, brief responses come across as apathetic and even sarcastic to the receiver. This is unfortunate because this is rarely the sender’s intent. The best way to avoid being misinterpreted in a brief response is to share your intent. Even responding with “I’m a little busy but should be able to read it later this week” comes across much better than “Got it,” which a lot of people will interpret as indifference.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Compulsive CC and Reply All</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CCing people all the time is one of the most annoying things you can do when communicating electronically. I’d say it’s the most annoying, but this honor is bestowed on the excessive “Reply All.” If someone sends an email to you and a bunch of other people, do you really think every recipient needs to get another email from you saying “thanks”? They don’t, and when you do this, it sends people climbing up a wall. The trick for knowing when to CC someone is to treat your message as if it’s an in-person meeting. The question then becomes, “Would it be necessary or helpful to have this person come to the meeting?” If the answer is no, then don’t waste their time with a message. As for Reply All, just don’t do it. Even if someone else in the thread Replies All, you’re still annoying everyone to death when you join the fray. If you have something to say, it’s better to send it directly (and privately) to the original sender and let them decide if the group should know about it, too.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The “URGENT” Subject Line</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subject lines that say “URGENT” or “ASAP” show complete disregard for the recipient. If your message is that urgent, pick up the phone and give the person a call. Even in the rare instance when a message is actually urgent, labeling it as such in the subject line is unnecessary and sets a strong, negative tone. The key to avoiding “URGENT” subject lines is twofold. First, if the issue is best dealt with in any form other than an electronic message, then that’s how you should be dealing with it. Second, if this is not the case, then the issue lies in your ability to create a strong subject line. After all, people check their messages frequently, so as long as your subject line catches their eye, it will get the job done. Instead of labeling the message urgent, ask yourself why the message is urgent. The answer to this question is your new subject line. If a client needs an answer today, then simply make your subject line “Client needs response today.” This maintains the sense of urgency without setting a rude, desperate tone.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Debbie Downer</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sending messages that consistently tell people what they’re doing wrong and what they shouldn’t be doing really takes a toll. Even if you’re trying to offer constructive criticism, you need to avoid negativity in your messages at all costs. Because people can’t hear your tone directly, they read into the connotations of words and create a tone in their heads as they go along. Negatives become especially negative in electronic form. Whenever you find yourself using negative words like “don’t,” “can’t,” “won’t,” or “couldn’t,” turn them into positives. Making this change transforms the entire tone of the message. For example, instead of saying, “You can’t complete reports like this in the future,” say, “Next time you complete a report, please…” When you must deliver negative feedback, don’t do it electronically. Just hop on the telephone or walk down the hall.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Robot</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s easy to think of electronic communication as a way to get something done quickly, but when you do this to the extreme, you come across as inhuman. You wouldn’t walk into someone’s office and hand them a report to complete without acknowledging them somehow. Jumping straight into the nitty-gritty might seem like the most effective thing to do, but it leaves a lasting negative impression. Fixing this one is simple. Just take an extra second to greet the person you’re writing to. You don’t have to ask your recipient about their weekend. Just a simple acknowledgment of the individual as a human being is all it takes. This keeps the tone much more respectful than if you simply sent assignments.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"habits-that-quiet-virtual-conflict\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#habits-that-quiet-virtual-conflict\" aria-label=\"habits that quiet virtual conflict permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>HABITS THAT QUIET VIRTUAL CONFLICT</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Habit 1: Follow Honest Abe’s First Rule of Netiquette</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I know what you’re thinking: How could someone who died more than a century before the Internet existed teach us about message etiquette? Well, in Lincoln’s younger years, he had a bad habit of applying his legendary wit when writing insulting letters to, and about, his political rivals. But after one particularly scathing letter led a rival to challenge Lincoln to a duel, he learned a valuable lesson-words impact the receiver in ways that the sender can’t completely fathom.</li>\n<li>By the time he died, Lincoln had amassed stacks of flaming letters that verbally shredded his rivals and subordinates for their bone- headed mistakes. However, Lincoln never sent them. He vented his frustration on paper and then stuffed the sheet away in a drawer. The following day, the full intensity of his emotions having subsided, Lincoln wrote and sent a much more congenial and conciliatory letter. We can all benefit from learning to do the same with electronic communication. Your emotions are a valid representation of how you feel (no matter how intense), but that doesn’t mean that acting on them in the moment serves you well. Go ahead and vent-tap out your anger and frustration on the keyboard. Save the draft and come back to it later when you’ve cooled down. By then, you’ll be rational enough to edit the message and pare down the parts that burn, or even better-rewrite the kind of message that you want to be remembered by.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Habit 2: Know the Limits of Virtual Humor</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some people show their displeasure with words typed in ALL CAPS and a barrage of exclamation points. Others, however, express dissatisfaction more subtly with sarcasm and satire. The latter is no less of a breakdown in the core emotional intelligence skill of self- management, and it can be even more dangerous because it’s harder to detect when you’re doing it. The sender can always convince themselves that the spite was just a little joke.</li>\n<li>Although a little good-natured ribbing can sometimes help lighten face-to-face interaction, it’s almost never a good idea to have a laugh at someone else’s expense when communicating electronically. In-person interactions equip you with an arsenal of facial expressions and voice inflections to help you convey the right tone. Digitally, you don’t have the same luxury. Your message can too easily be misinterpreted without your body language to help explain it, and you won’t be there to soften the blow when your joke doesn’t go over as intended. In the virtual world, it’s best to err on the side of friendliness and professionalism. For those times when you absolutely cannot resist using humor, just make sure you’re the butt of the joke.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Habit 3: Remember that People Virtually Are Still People</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>While entranced by the warm glow of a phone or computer screen, it’s sometimes difficult to remember that a living, breathing human being will end up reading your message. Psychologist John Suler of Rider University found that when people are communicating virtually, they experience a “disinhibition effect.” Without the real-time feedback between sender and receiver that takes place in face- to-face and telecommunication, we simply don’t worry as much about offending people virtually. We don’t have to experience the discomfort of watching someone else become confused, despondent, or angry because of something that we said. When these natural consequences are delayed, we tend to spill onto the screen whatever happens to be on our minds.</li>\n<li>To avert such messages, you have to apply your social awareness skills. When you cannot physically see the other person’s body language or hear the tone of their voice, picture the recipient in your mind and imagine what they might feel when reading your message as it’s been written. The next time you receive a curt or outright rude message, put the brakes on before firing back a retort. Taking the time to imagine the sender and consider where they’re coming from is often enough to extinguish the flames before they get out of control. Could the sender have misinterpreted a previous message that you sent to them? Could they just be having a bad day? Are they under a lot of pressure? Even when the other party is in the wrong, spending a moment on the other side of the screen will give you the perspective you need to avoid escalating the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Habit 4: Let the Emojis Flow</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emojis have a mixed reputation in the business world. Some people and even organizations believe that smiley faces, winks, and other caricatures of digital emotion are unprofessional and undignified, and have no place outside a school hallway. When used properly, however, emojis can effectively enhance the desired tone of a message, as shown by a Dutch research team. The team led by Daantje Derks at the Open University of the Netherlands concluded that “to a large extent, emojis serve the same functions as actual nonverbal behavior.” Considering that nonverbal behavior accounts for between 70% and 90% of a message when communicating face-to-face, it’s time to ditch the stigma attached to emojis in a business setting. For those leery of dropping a winky face into your next work message, I’m not suggesting that you smile, wink, and heart eyes your way through every message you write. Just don’t be afraid to use emojis when you want to be certain that the recipient understands the tone of your message.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Habit 5: Recognize When Online Chats Need to Become Offline Discussions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Managing online relationships will always be a somewhat difficult task for people built to communicate in person. However, they become substantially more difficult anytime emotions run strong. Significant, lengthy, and heated exchanges are almost always better taken offline and finished in person, or at least on the phone or a video chat. With so much communication via messaging and email these days, it can be hard to pull the trigger and initiate a face-to-face conversation when you sense that an interaction is becoming too heated or simply too difficult to do well online. Online technologies have become enormously useful for increasing the speed and efficiency of communication, but they have a long way to go before they become the primary source for creating and maintaining quality human relationships.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"avoid-integrity-traps\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#avoid-integrity-traps\" aria-label=\"avoid integrity traps permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Avoid Integrity Traps</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kiel’s data is clear: Companies perform better under the guidance of high-integrity leadership. Every leader has the responsibility to hone their integrity. This requires a great deal of emotional intelligence. Many times, there are integrity traps that tend to catch well- meaning leaders off guard. These traps are often driven by lapses in emotional intelligence. By studying these traps, you can sharpen the saw and keep your integrity high.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fostering a cult of personality.</strong> It’s easy for leaders to get caught up in their own worlds, as there are many systems in place that make it all about them. These leaders identify so strongly with their leadership roles that instead of remembering that the only reason they’re there is to serve others, they start thinking, “It’s my world, and we’ll do things my way.” Being a good leader requires remembering that you’re there for a reason, and that the reason certainly isn’t to get your way. High-integrity leaders not only welcome questioning and criticism but insist on it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dodging accountability.</strong> Politicians are notorious for refusing to be accountable for their mistakes, and business leaders do it, too. Even if only a few people (instead of millions) see a leader’s misstep, dodging accountability can be incredibly damaging. A person who refuses to say “the buck stops here” really isn’t a leader at all. Being a leader requires being confident enough in your own decisions and those of your team to own them when they fail. The very best leaders take the blame but share the credit. A boss who is too proud to admit a mistake or who singles out individuals in front of the group creates a culture that is riddled with fear and anxiety. It’s impossible to bring your best to your work when you’re walking on eggshells. Instead of pointing fingers when something goes wrong, good managers work collaboratively with their team and focus on solutions. They pull people aside to discuss slip-ups instead of publicly shaming them, and they’re willing to accept responsibility for mistakes made under their leadership.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Frequent threats of firing.</strong> Some managers use threats of termination to keep you in line and to scare you into performing better. This is a lazy and shortsighted way of motivating people, and it lacks integrity. People who feel disposable are quick to find another job where they’ll be valued and receive the respect they deserve.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Holding people back. As an employee, you want to bring value to your job, and you do so with a unique set of skills and experience. So, how is it that you can do your job so well that you become irreplaceable? This happens when managers sacrifice your upward mobility for their best interests. If you’re looking for your next career opportunity, and your boss is unwilling to let you move up the ladder, your enthusiasm is bound to wane. Taking away opportunities for advancement is a serious morale killer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Management may have a beginning, but it certainly has no end. When blessed with a talented employee, a manager should keep finding areas in which the employee can improve to expand their skill set and further their career. The most talented employees want feedback (more so than the less talented ones), and it’s a manager’s job to keep it coming. Otherwise, people become bored and complacent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lacking self-awareness.</strong> Many leaders think they have sufficient emotional intelligence. Often, they are proficient in some emotional intelligence skills, but when it comes to understanding themselves, they are woefully blind. It’s not that they’re hypocrites; they just don’t see what everyone else sees. They might play favorites, be tough to work with, or receive criticism badly. They think that because they don’t have angry outbursts, their emotional intelligence isn’t an issue, but everyone else knows that it is.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Forgetting that communication is a two-way street.</strong> Many leaders also think that they’re great communicators, not realizing that they’re communicating in only one direction. Some pride themselves on being approachable and easily accessible, yet they don’t really hear the ideas that people share with them. Some leaders don’t set goals or provide context for the things they ask people to do, while others never offer feedback, leaving people wondering if they’re more likely to get promoted or fired.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Not firing poor performers.</strong> Sometimes, whether it’s because they feel sorry for an employee or simply because they want to avoid conflict, leaders dodge making the really tough decisions. Although there’s certainly nothing wrong with being compassionate, real leaders know when it’s just not a good fit, and they understand that they owe it to the company and to the rest of the team to let someone go.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hiring and promoting the wrong people.</strong> Good, hardworking employees want to work with like-minded professionals. When managers don’t do the hard work of hiring good people, it’s a major demotivator for those stuck working alongside them. Doing so is lazy, and it’s a dereliction of duty that shows a lack of integrity. Promoting the wrong people (because they’re the manager’s favorites) is even worse. When you work your tail off only to get passed over for a promotion that’s given to someone who glad-handed their way to the top, it’s a massive insult. No wonder it makes good people leave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Succumbing to the tyranny of the urgent.</strong> The chapter on productivity introduced you to the tyranny of the urgent. This is what happens when leaders spend their days putting out small fires. They take care of what’s dancing around in front of their faces and lose focus on what’s truly important their people. Your integrity as a leader hinges on your ability to avoid distractions that prevent you from putting your people first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Micromanaging.</strong> You see this mistake most often in people who have recently worked their way up through the ranks. They still haven’t made the mental shift from doer to leader. Without something tangible to point to at the end of the day, they feel unproductive, not realizing that productivity means something different for a leader. As a result, they micromanage to the point of madness and fall off schedule. An important part of a leader’s integrity rests on giving people the freedom to do their jobs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Going back on their commitments.</strong> Making promises to people places you on the fine line that lies between making them very happy and watching them walk out the door. When you uphold a commitment, you grow in the eyes of your employees because you prove yourself to be trustworthy and honorable (two very important qualities in a boss). But when you disregard your commitment, you come across as slimy, uncaring, and disrespectful. After all, if the boss doesn’t honor their commitments, why should everyone else?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"make-yourself-even-more-likeable\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#make-yourself-even-more-likeable\" aria-label=\"make yourself even more likeable permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Make Yourself Even More Likeable</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ask a lot of questions.</strong> Likeable people ask lots of questions. The biggest mistake most people make when it comes to listening is that they’re so focused on what they’re going to say next or how what the other person is saying is going to affect them that they fail to hear what’s being said. The words come through loud and clear, but the meaning is lost. A simple way to avoid this is to ask a lot of questions. People like to know you’re listening, and something as simple as a clarification question shows that you are not only listening but also care about what they’re saying. You’ll be surprised how much respect and appreciation you gain just by asking questions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Put away your phone.</strong> Nothing turns someone off to you like a mid-conversation text message or even a quick glance at your phone. When you commit to a conversation, focus all your energy on the conversation and nothing else. You’ll find that conversations are more enjoyable and effective when you immerse yourself completely in them. While you’re having more fun, the people you’re interacting with will like you all the more, and that’s a winning proposition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Greet people by name.</strong> Your name is an essential part of your identity, and it feels terrific when people use it. Likeable people make certain they use others’ names every time they see them. However, you shouldn’t use someone’s name only when you greet them. Research shows that people feel validated when the person they’re speaking with refers to them by name during a conversation. If you’re great with faces but struggle with names, have some fun with it, and make a game out of remembering people’s names. Most people who struggle with names tend to forget the name of the person they’re introduced to right after they hear it. When this happens, don’t hesitate to ask their name a second time. People won’t be offended because they appreciate you making the effort to learn their names.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Smile.</strong> People naturally (and unconsciously) mirror the body language of the person they’re talking to. If you want people to like you, smile at them during the conversation, and they will unconsciously return the favor and feel good about you as a result. Smiling doesn’t just make you look happy; it makes you feel happier, too. Multiple studies have shown that smiling (even when the subjects are instructed to do so) stimulates the release of mood-enhancing endorphins and serotonin. Smiling also lowers your blood pressure and can even boost your immune system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t seek attention.</strong> People dislike those who are desperate for attention. You don’t need to develop a big, extroverted personality to be likeable. Simply being friendly and considerate is all you need to win people over. When you speak in a friendly, confident, and concise manner, you’ll notice that people are much more attentive and persuadable than if you try to show them that you’re important. People catch on to your attitude quickly and are more attracted to the right attitude than what or how many people you know. When you’re being given attention, such as when you’re being recognized for an accomplishment, shift the focus to all the people who worked hard to help you get there. This may sound clichéd, but if it’s genuine, the fact that you pay attention to others and appreciate their help shows that you’re appreciative and humble-two adjectives that are closely tied to likeability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Know who to touch and when to touch them.</strong> When you touch someone during a conversation, you release oxytocin in their brain, a neurotransmitter that makes their brain associate you with trust and a slew of other positive feelings. A simple touch on the shoulder, a hug, or a friendly handshake is all it takes to release oxytocin. Of course, you have to touch the right person in the right way to release oxytocin, as unwanted or inappropriate touching has the opposite effect. Just remember, relationships are built not just from words but also from general feelings about each other. Touching someone appropriately is a great way to show you care.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Follow the platinum rule.</strong> We all know the golden rule, and it’s pretty easy to follow. The platinum rule is harder to follow because it requires us to treat people the way they want to be treated. Not only does doing so make the other person more comfortable (and therefore more likely to open up and connect with you), but it also proves that you’ve been listening and have really heard what they’ve been telling you. That shows valuable extra effort on your part. The trick is that when you’re engaged in conversation, you have to focus more on the other person than you do on yourself. Otherwise, you’ll never be able to understand what makes them tick and, therefore, how they want to be treated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Balance passion and fun.</strong> People gravitate toward those who are passionate because their zest for life is appealing. That said, it’s easy for passionate people to come across as too serious or uninterested because they tend to get absorbed in their passions. Likeable people balance their passion with an ability to have fun. They are serious but friendly. They minimize small talk and gossip and focus on having meaningful interactions with others. They remember what you said to them yesterday or last week, which shows you’re just as important to them as anything else they are passionate about.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"unlikeable-habits\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#unlikeable-habits\" aria-label=\"unlikeable habits permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>UNLIKEABLE HABITS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Humble bragging.</strong> We all know people who like to brag about themselves behind the mask of self-deprecation. For example, the woman who makes fun of herself for being a nerd when she really wants to draw attention to the fact that she’s smart or the guy who makes fun of himself for having a strict diet when he really wants you to know how healthy and fit he is. Although many people think that self- deprecation masks their bragging, everyone sees right through it. This makes the bragging all the more frustrating because it isn’t just bragging; it’s also an attempt to deceive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Name-dropping.</strong> It’s great to know important and interesting people, but using every conversation as an opportunity to name-drop is pretentious and silly. Just like humble bragging, people see right through it. Instead of making you look interesting, it makes people think that you’re insecure and overly concerned with having them like you. It also cheapens what you have to offer. When you connect everything you know with who you know (instead of what you know or what you think), conversations lose their color.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gossiping.</strong> People make themselves look terrible when they get carried away with gossiping. Wallowing in talk of other people’s misdeeds or misfortunes may end up hurting their feelings if the gossip ever finds its way to them, and gossiping is guaranteed to make you look negative and spiteful every time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Emotional hijackings.</strong> At TalentSmartEQ, I spent much of my career designing and validating 360 feedback assessments. These tests give coworkers the opportunity to provide anonymous feedback on an employee’s behavior in the workplace. We’ve come across far too many instances of people throwing things, screaming, making people cry, and other telltale signs of emotional hijacking. An emotional hijacking demonstrates low emotional intelligence. As soon as you show that level of instability, people question whether you’re trustworthy and capable of keeping it together when it counts. Exploding at anyone, regardless of how much they might “deserve it,” turns a huge amount of negative attention your way. You’ll be labeled unstable, unapproachable, and intimidating. Controlling your emotions keeps you in the driver’s seat. When you’re able to control your emotions around someone who wrongs you, they end up looking bad instead of you. This increases your likeability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Having a closed mind.</strong> If you want to be likeable, you must be open-minded, which makes you approachable and interesting to others. No one wants to have a conversation with someone who has already formed an opinion and is unwilling to listen. To eliminate preconceived notions and judgment, you need to see the world through other people’s eyes. This doesn’t require that you believe what they believe or condone their behavior; it simply means that you quit passing judgment long enough to truly understand what makes them tick.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sharing too much too early.</strong> While getting to know people requires a healthy amount of sharing, sharing too much about yourself right off the bat comes across wrong. Be careful to avoid sharing personal problems and confessions too quickly. Likeable people let the other person guide them as to when it’s the right time for them to open up. Oversharing comes across as self-obsessed and insensitive to the balance of the conversation. Think of it this way: If you’re getting into the nitty gritty of your life without learning about the other person first, you’re sending the message that you see them as nothing more than a sounding board for your problems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sharing too much on social media.</strong> Studies have shown that people who overshare on social media do so because they crave acceptance, but Pew Research Center research has revealed that this oversharing works against them by making people dislike them. Sharing on social media can be an important mode of expression, but it needs to be done thoughtfully and with some self-control. Letting everyone know what you ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner will do more harm than good when it comes to likeability.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"forming-strong-connections\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#forming-strong-connections\" aria-label=\"forming strong connections permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>FORMING STRONG CONNECTIONS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Leave a strong first impression.</strong> Research shows that most people decide whether they like you within the first seven seconds of meeting you. They then spend the rest of the conversation internally justifying their initial reaction. This may sound terrifying, but by knowing this, you can take advantage of it to connect with anyone. First impressions are tied intimately to positive body language. Becoming aware of your gestures, expressions, and tone of voice (and making certain they’re positive) will draw people to you like ants to a picnic. Using an enthusiastic tone, uncrossing your arms, maintaining eye contact, and leaning toward the person who’s speaking are all forms of positive body language that people with high emotional intelligence use to draw others in. Positive body language can make all the difference in a conversation. It’s true that how you say something can be more important than what you say.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be the first to venture beyond the superficial.</strong> Our first conversation or two with a new acquaintance tends to be pretty superficial. We portray a careful picture of ourselves, and we stick to nice, safe topics. We talk about the weather and people we know in common and share the most basic details from our lives. But if you really want to connect with somebody, try upping the ante and revealing the real you. You don’t need to get too personal, but it’s important to let the other person know what you’re passionate about. Most of the time, if you open up, the other person will follow your lead and do the same. You’ll find that your conversations have real depth because you’re willing to reveal some of what lies beneath the surface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ask good questions.</strong> Sometimes asking a lot of questions isn’t enough, and the conversation feels like it’s going nowhere. If the other person seems hesitant to open up, encourage them to do so by asking substantial questions. “What do you do?” doesn’t further the conversation nearly as much as, “Why did you choose your profession?” Search for questions that will help you understand what makes the other person tick without getting too personal. Some questions will lead nowhere, and others will open doors that get the conversation going. When you land on a question that really gets the other person talking, ask thoughtful follow-up questions that further this line of thought.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Learn from others.</strong> During the course of his research, Lieberman concluded that our educational system would be much more effective if we tapped into the social side of learning, rather than trying to quash it. For example, the best way to help an eighth grader struggling with math is to have him get help from another student. Apply that same principle to your life, and be willing to learn from the person you’re trying to connect with. Not only does that make them feel more bonded to you, it also makes them feel important. It also shows that you’re willing to be vulnerable and aren’t too proud to admit that you have much to learn. This makes you far more interesting than someone who appears to have everything figured out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t make them regret removing the mask.</strong> If your new acquaintance does you the honor of opening up, don’t make them regret it. Sarcasm, criticism, or jokes that might make the other person feel judged for what they’ve shared are major faux pas. Instead, empathize with their approach to life, which you can do even if you don’t agree with their beliefs, and then reciprocate by revealing more about yourself. This process of reciprocation is quick to create new depth in relationships.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Look for the good in them.</strong> Our culture can often predispose us to cynicism. We seem to focus on finding reasons not to like people, instead of reasons to like them. Shut that cynical voice off, and concentrate on looking for the good in a new acquaintance. For one thing, that keeps you from writing someone off too soon, but more importantly, when you expect the best from people, they’re likely to deliver it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don’t make it a contest.</strong> We’ve all seen the stereotypical sitcom scene where two guys in a bar spend the night trying to one-up each other. The same thing happens when you meet someone new. Their accomplishments and life experiences sneak up on you and make you feel the urge to make yourself look just as good (if not better). Doing so may stroke your ego, but it doesn’t help you connect with them. It keeps you focused on yourself when you should be trying to learn about others and find common ground.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Turn off your inner voice.</strong> One giant thing that keeps us from connecting with other people is that we don’t really listen. Instead, we’re thinking while the other person is talking. To be clear, we hear what the other person is saying (the words come through loud and clear), but our relentless inner voice ensures the meaning is lost. You must turn off this inner voice if you want to connect deeply with people. So what if you forget what you were going to say or if the conversation moves in a different direction before you have a chance to make your point? If your real goal is to connect with someone, you have to shut off your own soundtrack long enough to focus on what they’re telling you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"have-a-few-tricks-up-your-sleeve\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#have-a-few-tricks-up-your-sleeve\" aria-label=\"have a few tricks up your sleeve permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>HAVE A FEW TRICKS UP YOUR SLEEVE</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open hands and palms create trust.</strong> An employee policy at LEGOLAND says whenever someone asks where something is, the employee “presents” (open-palm gesture) their directions instead of “pointing” them. This is because the open-palmed gesture conveys trust, making people more likely to agree with what you’re saying and to find you friendly and likeable. Pointing, on the flip side, is generally seen as aggressive and rude.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When a group of people laughs, each member of the group can’t help but make eye contact with the person they feel closest to.</strong> This trick can make you an astute observer of relationships of all types. It can tell you who is bonding and learning to trust one another, just as easily as it can tell you if you might have a shot at landing a date with a certain someone. Of course, you’ll learn a lot about how you feel about other people just by paying attention to whom you unconsciously make eye contact with.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Silence gets answers.</strong> When you ask someone a question and they’re slow to respond, don’t feel pressure to move the conversation forward. Remaining silent plays to your advantage. Moments of silence make people feel as though they should speak, especially when the ball is in their court. This is a great tool to use in negotiations and other difficult conversations. Just make certain you resist the urge to move the conversation forward until you get your answer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Nodding during a conversation or when asking a question makes the other person more likely to agree with what you’re saying.</strong> The next time you need to win someone over to your way of thinking, try nodding as you speak. People unconsciously mirror the body language of those around them to better understand what other people are feeling. When you nod as you speak, you convey that what you’re saying is true and desirable and people are more inclined to agree with you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>People remember unfinished things better.</strong> The natural tendency to remember unfinished things is called the Zeigarnik effect. Ever notice how some television commercials get cut off early? The company paying for the commercial cuts it off so that it sticks in your head longer than other commercials. The best way to forget unfinished things (commercials or songs) is to finish them in your head. If a song gets stuck in your head, try singing the last lines to yourself. You’ll be amazed at how quickly it goes away.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When someone does a favor for you, it actually makes them like you more.</strong> When you convince someone to do you a favor, they unconsciously justify why they are willing to do so. Typical justifications include things such as “She’s my friend,” “I like her,” and “She seems like the kind of person who would return the favor.” These justifications serve you perfectly. Not only did you just get help with something, but the other party also likes you more than they did before.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>People’s feet reveal their interest.</strong> When talking to someone, pay attention to their feet. If their feet are aimed at you, they’re interested and listening to what you’re saying. If their feet point away from you, they’re most likely disinterested and mentally checked out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When you meet someone new, working their name into the conversation ensures you’ll remember it.</strong> The goal is to repeat their name three times in the first five minutes. It works extremely well, but the trick is to do it naturally. When you rattle off their name unnecessarily, it sounds foolish and awkward. Try to use phrases like “Hello,_<strong><strong>” “Nice to meet you,” and “Where are you from,</strong></strong>__?”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Showing excitement makes other people like you.</strong> This goes back to the idea that we mirror the behavior of those around us.

<li>When deciding whether to invest in a company, carefully analyze its soundness.</li>
</ul>
<p>True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that doesn’t is speculation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Investors often profit by buying securities that are selling below their intrinsic value.</li>
<li>The three main classes of security are “investment bonds and preferred stocks,” “speculative bonds and preferred stocks,” and “common stocks.”</li>
<li>An issuer’s financial strength and ability to pay determine its bonds’ safety.</li>
<li>Preferred stocks should meet all the safety tests required of bonds.</li>
<li>You can profit from the purchase of some bonds and preferred stocks that do not qualify as investment grade if they are selling below their intrinsic value.</li>
<li>Privileged issues have the safety of preferred stocks, but they also have the upside potential of common stocks.</li>
<li>Portfolio diversification can offset the variability of common stock prices.</li>
<li>As an investor you should evaluate common stocks based on dividends, earnings and asset values.</li>
<li>Each of the elements in valuation — assets, earnings power, and growth — is useful in its own right, but the best insights into a firm’s value come from comparisons among them, especially the direct comparison between the asset value and the EPV.</li>
<li>If the EPV is substantially greater than the asset value, that difference is due to superior management or competitive advantages</li>
<li>don’t make investments into things that have a NPV of less than zero</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Security analysis is the process of deciding which securities are sound investments. True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that does not meet these criteria is speculation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>common obstacles to analyst</p>
<ul>
<li>inadequate or incorrect data</li>
<li>uncertainties of future</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 functions of analysis</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Descriptive function</strong>
<ul>
<li>collecting important facts and presenting them in an understandable manner. This would reveal:
<ul>
<li>reveal strong and weak points</li>
<li>make comparisons with similar issues</li>
<li>appraise for future performance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Selective Function</strong>
<ul>
<li>express specific judgement, by determining whether an issue should be bought, held, sold, etc.</li>
<li>common approach is to analyze company’s ability to earn and make payments to the investor.</li>
<li>Intrinsic value is the estimated valuation based on the analyst’s opinion of the intrinsic worth of the security from different source of information such as assets, earnings, dividends, growth, management, etc…
<ul>
<li>value of a business can be analyzed from the perspective of multiple earnings (P/E ratio, “earnings power”). It is cautioned that valuing a business solely from the earnings power is very risky and uncharacteristic of wise analyst.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Critical Function</strong>
<ul>
<li>“Analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts”</li>
<li>should seek adequate protective provisions (margin of safety) in bonds and preferred stocks.</li>
<li>must be alert to the misrepresentation by accountants and management bad practices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Market analysis, in contrast to security analysis, attempts to forecast prices of individual securities or the action of the whole market, without referring to underlying facts about individual companies. One type of market analysis, called technical analysis, refers only to past market values in order to predict future values. A second type of analysis refers to indices of economic activity outside the market that, presumably, have some influence over security prices. Neither of these kinds of market analysis has proven effective and both essentially promote speculation over reasoned, fact-based investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intrinsic value is an important concept for security analysis. However, “intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms, it is understood to be that value which is justified by the facts…the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct…from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excess.” Although investors cannot calculate an exact intrinsic value for a given security because so many variables are involved, careful examination can determine whether the price the market quotes is appropriate. Securities that meet stringent safety tests and appear to be selling well below their intrinsic value often can be profitable investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Securities traditionally fall into two categories: stocks and bonds. This classification is inadequate, because it pays more attention to the form of the security than to its safety and purpose. The various types of securities may be more accurately classified into three groups, each of which has its own criteria for what constitutes a sound investment: fixed-value securities, including high-grade bonds and preferred stocks; variable-value senior securities, including speculative bonds and preferred stocks; and common stocks.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Bonds are not automatically safe investments because of their form. Rather, the soundness of a bond investment derives from the issuer’s ability to pay, which is, in turn, based on its financial strength. Therefore, the investor who is considering purchasing a bond should ask the following questions: Is the value of the company’s business more than the value of its debts? Can the company meet its financial obligations even in the worst-case scenario, such as a recession or depression?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although no company or industry is depression-proof, two factors contribute to a company’s resilience in hard times: dominant size within its industry and sufficient earnings to cover its bond interest by a large margin. Bonds of companies that do not meet these requirements are not considered investment grade, even if the yield is highly attractive. A high yield cannot compensate for failure to pay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preferred stocks combine the limited return of bonds with the instability of common stocks. Despite these unattractive features, preferred stocks can be safe investments if they meet the same safety requirements as a bond, their margin of safety is large enough that management is unlikely to suspend preferred dividends, and the stability of the company exceeds that required for a bond investment. These stringent requirements limit the number of investment-grade preferred stocks to a very select group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Income bonds, also called adjustment bonds, should be subject to the same strict investment criteria as preferred stocks. Guaranteed issues occupy a position between bond debt and preferred stocks. Prospective investors must carefully examine the terms of the guarantee and evaluate the guarantor’s financial strength. Even with fixed-value investments, investors should periodically evaluate their holdings. There is no such thing as a permanent investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although many bonds and preferred stocks do not meet the requirements that would qualify them as investment grade, some issues in this category may nevertheless be worth purchasing, because they are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Investors must take care to avoid issues that are selling at a discount for other reasons – for example, because the company is financially unsound.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>avoid compromising the assumed risk for an increased reward to minimize the loss of principal
<ul>
<li>if risk is assumed, it should be in the form of paying a cheaper price (therefore lowering the principal required to acquire the security), instead of accepting a higher coupon or dividend.</li>

<ul>
<li>safety is measured by the ability of the issuer to meet obligations - not by contractual rights</li>
<li>in theory, if a business fails, the bond holder recovers his money from assets; but that often fails because:
<ul>
<li>property values shrink when the business fails</li>
<li>there is difficulty in establishing legal rights</li>
<li>there are inherent delays in receivership</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to avoid trouble is better seeking protection after it occurs</li>
<li>debt should bed assessed from the cashflow statement
<ul>
<li>“good” debt is when company is using financed capital for an opportunity or expansion that might require a quick entry to the market</li>
<li>“bad” debt is when the business is required to borrow in order to sustain operations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>bonds should be bought on their ability to withstand a depression or recession; relative safety is found in companies of a) dominant size, and b) substantial margin or earnings over bond interests.</li>
<li>presumption of safety based upon either the character of the industry or the mount of protection</li>
<li>investor should look for industries least likely to be affected by a depression.</li>
<li>investment practice recognizes importance of character of the industry. <strong>historically some industries and public utilities have been more stable than others, and equally their degree of stability has altered with time</strong>. This changing dynamic must be considered when assessing an organization’s ability to continue meeting future payments on fixed income securities</li>
<li>depression performance as a test of merit.</li>
<li>various causes of bond collapses
<ul>
<li>excessive funded debt of utilities: defaults were causes by over-extended debt, not by lack or earnings</li>
<li>stability of railroad earnings overrated: such as diminished earnings a failure to recognize changes in transportation methods</li>
<li>unavailability of sound bonds no excuse for buying poor ones. The investor should never be tempted by the lack of a good opportunity to venture into a poor one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there are 2 incorrect theories:
<ul>
<li>that issuing a bond is a statement of financial weakness</li>
<li>bonds are only issued when companies cannot issue stock</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>proper theory of bond financing: A reasonable amount of funded debt is an advantage (typically rooted in the company’s ability to take their product or service to market quickly). if the company need to issue debt to simply pay their bills and expenses, this is a signal that the bond is unsafe.</li>
<li>significance of the foregoing to the investor: whenever there is money available to invest, it is invested. when higher yielding securities disappear from the market place, analysts need to accept a lower yielding security to ensure the protection of principal instead of choosing more yield in a second rate issue.</li>

<ul>
<li>lack of safety is not compensated by a high dividend or coupon</li>
<li>no mathematical relationship between yield and risk: prices and yields often depend on popularity. Graham suggests that the public’s familiarity with the issuing company and its ability to be quickly sold on the market is a considerable factor in the market price of bonds</li>
<li>the factor of cyclical risks: an insurance company spreads risk over a large field; the investor has only a small field and cannot afford a program entailing a small sample size with large risk</li>
<li>risk and yield are incommensurable. Graham mentions, yet again, that the analyst should not pay a par value for a risky bond that has a high yield. Instead, he should pay a considerable discount below the par value, therefore minimizing his risk of principal.</li>
<li>reversal of customary procedure recommended: don’t start with inspecting the safest fixed income issues on a list and work down. Instead, start with the security that represents a minimal threshold of safety and work up on the list. This way the analyst protects themselves from going deeper into the list - likely resulting in the purchase of an unsafe issue.</li>

<ul>
<li>Graham recommends the implementation of similar rules and regulations that savings banks use for fixed income investments, since they are required and obligated by law to minimize their expose to risk.</li>

<li>obligations of foreign governments
<ul>
<li>Graham agreed with the decision to disallow the purchase of foreign bonds for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>the factor of political expediency</li>
<li>the foreign trade argument</li>
<li>the individual record argument: it is suggested some countries are more creditworthy than others. Graham argues that only Canada, Holland, and Switzerland demonstrated “unquestionable investing ratings” during his era</li>
<li>two-fold objection to purchase foreign government bonds. Generally speaking, foreign bonds should be avoided for 2 reasons
<ul>
<li>the basis for obtaining credit is fragile</li>
<li>the past performance is unsatisfactory. Graham then provides Canada as the sole exception to his doubts</li>
</ul>

<li>income bonds in weaker position than debentures. Debentures are required to make payments; where as income bonds are not required to make payments. As a result, Graham believes the mandatory coupon payment for a debenture provides less risk to the holder than an income bond.</li>
<li>standards of safety should not be relaxed because of early maturity. If 2 different bonds, a short term and a long term, are issued and secured by the same company. The risk is no different for either bond if the short-term issue can’t be paid at maturity.</li>

<li>investor should not take higher return for risk, instead they should pay a lower principal. For examples, when a municipal government issues new bonds at higher interest rates, because of the risk of default, the investor should be skeptical of such investments</li>

<ul>
<li>the soundness of the bond rests on the ability of the issuing corporation to support its financial obligations, and much less on the potential value of its property for a lien. With that in mind, there is no purpose in devising a minimal pledged level of property value to support the bond.</li>
<li><strong>special types of obligations</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>equipment obligations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>equipment trust certificates may be issued against specific items of use by the corporation, for instance, again, a car. Although these certificates promise safety at time of sale, the debtor may only receive 50% of what he expects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>collateral-trust bonds</strong>
<ul>
<li>these are bonds that are secured by common stock or other bonds, often of the same corporation.</li>
<li>these bonds offer very little security if issued from the same corporation or subsidiary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>real estate bonds</strong>
<ul>
<li>the value of the property is often directly related to the success of the corporation.</li>
<li>property values and earning power closely related. Graham forcefully cautions investor that this is not true for buildings that were erected for special purposes and manufacturing</li>
<li>misleading character of appraisals</li>
<li>abnormal rental used as basis of valuation</li>
<li>debt based on excessive construction costs: over-valuation led to over-building which raised construction costs. When the market caught up, the loan against the expensive costs could not be supported.</li>
<li>weakness of specialized buildings such as hospital or factory</li>
<li>values based on initial rentals misleading: rentals obtained on a new building are higher that can be obtained for an old building. The duration of the bond issue needs to account for a declining premium for rent due to the age of the building</li>
<li>suggested rules of procedure
<ul>
<li>for single family dwellings, the lender should be sure the amount lent is not more than two thirds the value of the property as determined by the market assessment.</li>
<li>the lender should fully understand the costs associated with constructing the property and not exceed the mortgage by 50%</li>
<li>there should be conservatively structured income account that accounts for vacancies and a building that doesn’t fetch the premium of a newly constructed property. This account should demonstrate quality coverage over the net income.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Some senior securities carry certain privileges that make them attractive purchases on a speculative basis, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Convertible issues” – In certain cases, investors can exchange convertible issues for common stock.</li>
<li>“Participating issues” – Investors can receive part of any increased dividend that common stockholders earn.</li>
<li>“Subscription-warrant issues” – These include option warrants to purchase common stock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These issues combine the increased safety of a senior security and the possible price appreciation of common stock. However, as with bonds, the attractive form does not mean that all securities of this type are safe. Only a limited number of such issues meet investment-grade safety requirements; the remainder belong to the same category as common-stock investments, because they share that category’s speculative features. When evaluating privileged issues, consider the amount of the profit-sharing benefits per dollar invested, the proximity of the event that will trigger profit-sharing advantages and the duration of the privileges.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Common stocks, as a class, are much more speculative than senior issues. Yet they are important to the US financial system, and novice and expert investors alike eagerly follow their prices, so security analysts know how to deal with them. The false belief that common stocks were a good buy at any price – as long as the company’s earning trend was positive – partly fueled the crash of 1929. Clearly the practice of making common-stock investments safer deserves further analysis, because the possibility of significant price appreciation will always lure investors to this type of security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the instability of common stock prices makes any given organization a dubious investment, portfolio diversification can offset this risk to some extent. Investors should subject their common stocks portfolios to thorough analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncertainty regarding future growth is usually the main reason why value estimations based on present value calculations are so prone to error</p>

<li>the owners of the common stock with to know their value</li>
<li>human nature often masks logic behind an endless cycle of greed for profit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>history of common stock analysis</strong>: over the previous 30 years (from 1910-1940), common stocks have become more favored due to their substantial earnings and dividends. With more and more companies providing detailed financial information, investors have had statistical data to substantiate their investments. During 1927-1929, Graham says most investors neglected this analysis and simply purchased more common stock based on speculative greed for profit and prophecy</li>
<li><strong>analysis vitiated by 2 types of instability</strong>:
<ul>

<li>instability of tangibles aspect</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>a company’s market price was generally stable and predictable if the companies had the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>the company paid a reasonable and consistent dividend</li>
<li>earnings were stable and averaged a substantial margin over dividend</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>the new era theory</strong>
<ul>
<li>during the roaring 1920’s, there’s idea that value of common stocks was completely dependent on what it will earn in the future. This new thesis had three supporting insights:
<ul>
<li>the dividend holds little emphasis on the value</li>
<li>the relationship between asset value and earnings power had little significance</li>
<li>the past earnings were of little significant value except when signifying momentum in growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>cases for this changed viewpoint</strong>
<ul>
<li>in short, Graham thinks that the drastic change in common stock valuation stemmed from unpredictable results often seen from using historical data and the irresistible potential for profits that had occurred.</li>
<li>in the early 1930’s many liquidations occurred. These events often produced very little value for the fixed assets the companies had listed on their balance sheets. This experience also caused investors to abandon the emphasis on book value or net-work of assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>attention shifted to the trend of earnings</strong></li>
<li><strong>the common stocks as long term investments doctrine</strong>
<ul>
<li>few key points
<ul>
<li>the value was based on what the common stock could earn in the future</li>
<li>good common stocks have a rising earnings (or EPS)
<ul>
<li>what it excludes is the idea that a price is associated with the earnings one can expect to receive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>relies on an improvement in the stock’s future performance.</li>
<li>therefore making the approach <strong>speculative</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>new era investment equivalent to prewar speculation</strong></li>
<li><strong>stocks regarded as attractive irrespective of their prices</strong>: non-sense</li>
<li>investment trusts came to resemble this new doctrine
<ul>
<li>analysis abandoned by investment trusts. Graham voices his disgust for the professional investor who didn’t safe guard the capital of their customers due to a lazy assessment of facts and risk analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>a sound premise used to support an unsound conclusion</strong>
<ul>
<li>in 1924, a book by the name of common stocks as long-term investments, by edgar lawrence smith was published. the premise of the book is that common stocks outperform bonds because not all the earnings are paid to the owners as dividends. This retained earnings by the company makes the value of the common stock increase in market price. Although Graham agreed with the basic tenants of Edgar’s thesis, he strongly disagrees with the exaggeration many investors took in their application of his ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>average vs trend of earnings</strong>
<ul>
<li>Graham suggests that earnings trends and earning averages are nothing more than speculative tools for analysts to predict future results. In fact, companies that have accelerated growth demonstrate an untapped market for more competitors.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>secular expansion as basis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>have a diversified portfolio of common stocks</li>
<li>when recessions occur, the investor can still benefit in the common stock markets by 1) diversifying their portfolio, and 2) by adamantly rejecting common stocks trade for excessive premiums.</li>
<li>Graham says the investor cannot rely on historical earnings growth to provide safety and profit in the long haul. Specifically, he’s talking about companies that are commonly referred to as “growth picks”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>individual growth as basis of sections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>use quantitative and qualitative factor to determine the value of common stocks similarly to the techniques for bonds.</li>
<li>what are growth companies?
<ul>
<li>maybe a company whose earnings move forward from cycle to cycle.</li>
<li>maybe company’s earnings grow at a faster rate than the general market</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>can investor identify them?
<ul>
<li>no, typical investor can’t realistically determine when and where the company’s growth will eventually subside. As a result, there’s a strong chance that the investor might select the stock “at the top of the earnings wave”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>does the price discount the potential growth?
<ul>
<li>it’s difficult to determine the price to pay for the future earnings that haven’t been demonstrated yet.</li>
<li>it’s impossible to predict how much longer the earnings growth is going to take place. One thing almost everyone can agree is that high earnings growth (like 30%) is temporary and not sustainable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>may such purchases be described as investment commitments
<ul>
<li>can thorough analysis and thought go into the selection of the growth stock.
<ul>
<li>maybe yes, as some growth investors do conduct themselves appropriately</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>is the price paid for the investment something that a reasonable person would pay if they could buy the whole business?
<ul>
<li>if a person is willing to pay more than 20% more for a common stock than he would for outright ownership of the entire business, the pick become speculative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>utilize even more effort than bonds to assess the future outlook of common stocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>selection based on margin of safety principle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>factors complicating efforts to exploit general market swings
<ul>
<li>index of leading stocks were selected and analyzed as a group (like the S&#x26;P 500). Also a base or normal value for the group of stocks could be determined by taking their average earnings and capitalizing them at the going long term interest rate (like the 10 or 30 year federal bond). This is where Graham tell analysts that the intrinsic value of stocks is directly tied to interest rates.
<ul>
<li>this approach has 3 drawbacks
<ul>
<li>first, the general market patterns may be anticipated, but the actual buying and selling points may still be chosen poorly.</li>
<li>market behavior may change in the future and not response in the same manner as before</li>
<li>this approach requires a very determined and vigilant individual because his actions will be the opposite of human psychology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the undervalued individual issue approach:
<ul>
<li>likelihood of finding an individual common stock that possess the qualitative factors and the quantitative factors (compared to price) is rare. if this type of stock issue is found, Graham says it should be classified as an investment and not speculation.</li>
<li>Graham says the most important way to view the purchase of a common stock is if the investor could purchase the entire business at once.</li>

Dividends</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before investing in a common stock, investigate both the firm’s dividend rate and its history of paying dividends. The dividend rate is important, because a dollar of surplus earnings is worth more to the investor when the company chooses to pay it as a dividend instead of reinvesting it in the business. Generally, companies that pay higher dividends have higher stock prices. However, management can suspend common-stock dividends at any time, so it is important to view the company’s dividend history as an indication, but not a guarantee, of future income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extraordinary stock dividends</strong> (stock splits), on the other hand, are largely illusory, because they give investors nothing they did not already own. An improvement on this practice is for companies to pay periodic stock dividends, representing a return to the shareholders of surplus earnings reinvested in the business.</p>
<ul>
<li>although stock dividends and stock splits create no real value for the holders, much speculation about the value of the companies after the division is likely to occur due to the cheaper price.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>periodic stock dividends</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>with a periodic stock dividend, the shareholder often receives a smller and reasonable stock dividend that adds value over time.</li>
<li>company should not provide a periodic stock dividend if the amount exceeds the funds being retained in earnings. The dividend could eventually exceeded the company’s ability to retain earnings power and the EPS slowly declined over a 10 year period, along with the market price.</li>
<li>Graham suggests the dividend should be dispersed as a preferred share.
<ul>
<li>it doesn’t weaken the capital structure of the business like the common stock dividend.</li>
<li>allows the company to retain earnings until a safe and manageable surplus is realized.</li>
<li>this technique gives management flexibility and control to pay the dividend as long as they choose.</li>
<li>once the retained earnings have been distributed, the obligation is no longer on the books once the preferred share is repurchased by the company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graham suggests that the market price of common stocks will perform similarly if management pays a healthy and sustainable dividend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>established principle of withholding dividends</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham claims that 2 companies with the same general business model and the same earnings will trade at different prices if the dividend policy is different. The market will value the company with the higher dividend more favorably.</li>
<li>should a company pay a lower dividend in order to create stability for the owner with an assured payment, or should they pay a higher dividend and meet its obligation irregularly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the merits of “plowing back” earnings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>there’re 2 reasons retained earnings is beneficial to the stock holder.
<ul>
<li>whatever good for the company was good for the shareholder.</li>
<li>company that retained earnings had more agility to remain competitive in difficult markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if a company sustains a favorable ROE over a long period of time, it means the management is properly investing the retained earnings and adding value to the shareholder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>dividend policies arbitrary and sometimes selfishly determined</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham suggests that many board members are executives and friends of executives with very large portion of shares. As a result, they might want to minimize their personal tax burden by receiving smaller dividends from the company.</li>
<li>leadership may seek a larger and more impressive sized business, therefore, using retained earnings to full fill their pursuit of an ever growing business (which may or may not add more earnings)</li>
<li>management may seek the opportunity to purchase outstanding shares at lower prices with the retained earnings.</li>
<li>a management that pays a small dividend is able to pay excessive salaries to executives and top level employees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>arbitrary control of dividend policy complicates analysis of common stocks</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>suggested principle for dividend payments</strong>: Graham holds the strong opinion that a company should pay a large portion of their earnings to the shareholders. He says it’s more important for the shareholder to receive non-standard (or inconsistent) dividend rates at a higher return, instead of a lower and more consistent dividend, which likely results in the company accumulating reserves that add little value.</p>

Earnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To analyze earnings, carefully study the company’s income statement. While earnings are undoubtedly important, security analysts have accorded them too much weight in calculating a company’s investment soundness. Management can manipulate a company’s earnings many ways. Therefore, always examine the firm’s income statement with a critical eye. For example, businesses can engineer nonrecurring charges and profits to produce a favorable earnings trend. A firm’s accountants also can generate perceived earnings by lowering or increasing the company’s reserves, or by reporting subsidiaries’ results in different ways. Companies can also present depreciation and amortization costs in a misleading manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investors must pay attention to more than current earnings. They should consider both the earnings trend and the long-term earnings average – preferably seven to ten years, putting more weight on the latter number. The analyst’s job is not predicting the future of a trend or intuiting possible price changes; it is making decisions based on facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>analyst should combine the information from the balance sheet and income statement to garner the best valuation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>disadvantages of sole emphasis on earning power</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>earnings statement has more variability than the balance sheet and therefore changes the value of the business making it appear unstable, the income statement can be more misleading than the balance sheet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>simplified statement of Wall Street’s Method of appraising common stocks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>price = Current Earnings Per Share (EPS) x Quality Coefficient</li>
<li>how does quality coefficient is determined?
<ul>
<li>probably by whole host of factors such as dividend rate, history, size and reputation of the business. Graham suspects all these factors are dwarfed by the real factor, which is earnings trend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>earnings not only fluctuate but are subject to arbitrary determination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>some of the techniques management can use to misrepresent earnings in the short term are the following
<ul>
<li>through allocating items to surplus (on the balance sheet) instead of revenue</li>
<li>through misrepresented amortization charges</li>
<li>through an amendment of the capital structure</li>
<li>through the use of large capital funds for items that don’t pertain to the business</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>significance of foregoing to the analyst</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the end, the analyst should be able to answer 3 questions:
<ul>
<li>what are the true earnings for the period studied?</li>
<li>what indications does the earnings record carry as to the future earning power?</li>
<li>what standards should be applied to the income statement to arrive at a reasonable valuation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>criticism and restatement of the income account</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the analyst will need to pay close attention to the ambiguous way the account rules can be applied
<ul>
<li>non-recurrent profits and losses. This is a one-time or highly infrequent profit or loss.</li>
<li>operations of subsidiaries and affiliates</li>
<li>reserves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>general observations on the income account</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>accounting rules permit management a range of choices in recording non-recurrent and special items, selecting between income and surplus, such items may be:
<ul>
<li>profit or loss on sale of fixed assets</li>
<li>profit or loss on sale of marketable securities</li>
<li>discount or premium on retirement of capital obligations</li>
<li>proceeds of life insurance policies</li>
<li>tax refunds and interest on refunds</li>
<li>gain or loss from litigation</li>
<li>extraordinary write down of inventory</li>
<li>extraordinary write down of receivables</li>
<li>cost of maintaining non-operating properties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the above items must be separated from the ordinary operating results to indicate earning power clearly (what the company might be expected to earn if the business condition remained similar)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>non-recurrent items: profits or losses from sale of fixed assets</strong>: these are not to be shown in current net income, they should appear in the surplus account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>profit from sale of marketable securities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>must be separated from ordinary operating results</li>
<li>methods used by investment trusts in reporting sale of marketable securities: over-all changes in principal value are the only measure of an investment trust’s performance, and this cannot be equated with recorded earnings of an industrial corporation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>profits through repurchase of senior securities at a discount</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a corporation may buy back its own securities at less than par value; any gain made is non-recurring and should be recorded as such. This was a feature of depression years 1931-33</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>as inventory losses are directly related to the conduct of the business, Graham suggests that it should not be treated as extraordinary</li>
<li><strong>manufactured earnings</strong>:
<ul>
<li>one example such as receivables and inventory written down to an artificially low “cost price”, which in turn will lead to a manufactured higher profit in the year to come. This illustrates the most vicious type of accounting manipulation: taking sums out of surplus, and then reporting these same sums as income in the following years. The danger of this accounting method is the public is not likely to recognize it, and even the expert analyst might have a hard time detecting it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>reserves for inventory loss</strong>
<ul>
<li>companies continuously set aside reserves to absorb losses on inventory before they occur. The implication is that the income statement does not always reflect inventory losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>other elements in inventory accounting</strong>
<ul>
<li>the standard procedure is to take inventory at the close of the year measured by the lowest of either cost price or market price.</li>
<li>last-in, first-out: measure the actual amount paid for the most recently acquired inventory. The theory behind this method is that a merchant’s selling price is related mainly to the current replacement price or the recent cost of the article sold. This method may be useful to reduce income tax, if there is inventory fluctuation.</li>
<li>the normal stock or basic-stock inventory method: a more radical method of minimizing fluctuations is the company must possess a certain physical stock of materials from year to year. This “permanent stock” would therefore keep the same value and not be imposed to any changes in price. In order to permit the base inventory to be carried at an unchanging figure on the balance sheet, the practice is to mark it down to a very low unit price, so low that it should never be necessary to reduce it further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>idle-plant expense</strong>: the cost of carrying non-operating properties is almost always charged against income, Graham suggests it should not. By doing so, it’s misleading to the expenses of the company’s core product or service. The analyst may properly consider idle-plant expense as belonging to a somewhat different from ordinary charges against operating income, as these expenses by nature are not part of the company’s normal operations.
<ul>
<li>in theory, these expenses should be temporary since the management can terminate these losses at any time by disposing of the property. therefore, if the company chose to spend the money, Graham does not deem it logical to consider these assets equivalent to a permanent liability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>deferred charges</strong>
<ul>
<li>a business sometimes incurs expenses which are applicable to a number of years rather than a single 12-month period such as:
<ul>
<li>organization expense (legal fees, etc…)</li>
<li>moving expenses</li>
<li>development expenses (for new products, processes, for opening up a mine, etc…)</li>
<li>discount on obligations sold</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the company is allowed to spread these types of costs over an appropriate period of years (5 years is a customary period of time). It is entered upon balance sheets as a deferred charges, which is written off by annual charges against earnings.</li>
<li>it is incorrect to write off these types of expenses in a single year, and against a ‘surplus’ as net income for coming years would be overstated, followed from the understated operating expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>amortization of bond discount</strong>
<ul>
<li>the discount should be amortized over the life of the bond by an annual charge against earnings.</li>
<li>the write-offs could be written against surplus to eliminate future annual deductions from earnings, and in that way to make the shares appear more valuable. This practice has aroused considerable criticism in recent years both from NYSE and from S.E.C</li>
</ul>

Earnings of subsidiaries</h3>
<ul>
<li>if parent company has an unprofitable division, its losses must be shown as a deduction from normal earnings</li>
<li><strong>flagrant example of padded income accounts</strong>: on rare occasions management would include earnings in the income statement that have no existence.</li>
<li><strong>balance sheet and income-tax checks upon the published earnings statements</strong>
<ul>
<li>to check upon the reliability of the published earnings is to look at the amount of federal income tax accrued. The taxable profit can be calculated from the income-tax accrual, and this profit compared in turn with the earnings reported to stockholders. The two figures should not necessarily be the same, since the tax laws may give rise to a number of divergences. However, the wide differences should be noted and made the subject of further inquiry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>one cannot make a quantitative deduction to allow unscrupulous management; the only way to deal with such situations is to avoid them.</li>
<li><strong>subsidiary companies and consolidated reports</strong>
<ul>
<li>consolidated reports occur when an enterprise controls one or more operational subsidiaries so that it can disclose companies financial reports as a ‘group’ or one entity.</li>
<li>the important part for consolidation is to ensure nothing is counted twice, for example, the profit of the subsidiary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>special dividends paid by subsidiaries</strong>
<ul>
<li>parent companies can supplement their earnings through special dividends paid by their subsidiaries. This can be very misleading to an analyst and they need to account for this in their evaluation process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>broader significance of subsidiaries’ losses</strong>
<ul>
<li>should a subsidiary’s losses be represented on the parent company’s earnings?</li>
<li>should the analyst discount the value of parent company if they own an unprofitable interest in another company?</li>
<li>it is clear from the standpoint of proper accounting that as long as a company continues to control an unprofitable division, it’s losses must be shown as a deduction from normal earnings.</li>
<li>if the amount involved is significant, the analyst should investigate whether or not the losses may be subject to early termination</li>
<li>the analyst may consider all or part of subsidiary’s losses equivalent to nonrecurring items.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>leading questions relative to depreciation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if a capital asset has a limited life, provisions must be made to write off the cost of the asset by charges against earnings distributed over the period of the assets life.</li>
<li>three complications arise
<ul>
<li>accounting rules may permit a value other than cost to acquire the asset as the basis for amortization charges.</li>
<li>there are numerous ways company can execute their depreciation/amortization charges from the balance sheet to the income statement.</li>
<li>sometimes account rules allow companies to make depreciation charges which don’t represent the reality of assets depreciation over time. This makes the analysts job very difficult to assess capital expenditures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>depreciation base other than cost</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham suggests substitute the replacement value of all the fixed assets at a given date, while everything prior is depreciated according to current accounting standards.</li>
<li>in most cases, companies don’t place much interest in ensuring their depreciation charges are representative of their assets’ ever-changing replacement costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>mark-downs to reduce depreciation charges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham believes that excessive write-downs of fixed assets are inexcusable and should not be condoned by the accounting profession. Accountants should refuse to certify a report containing such mark-downs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>balance sheet-income account discrepancies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>prevalent in the case of mining and oil companies, is to mark up fixed assets and then fail to increase the correspondingly depreciation charges on the income statement. This is done to benefit from the higher valuation in their balance sheet, without accepting the burden of consequently higher depreciation charges against net income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the vast majority of industrial companies follow the standard policy or charing an appropriate depreciation rate against each class of depreciable assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when the analyst knows that a company’s depreciation policy differs from the standard, there is special reason to check the adequacy of the allowance. Comparison with a company in the same field may yield significant differences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>depreciation charges often an issue in mergers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>concealed depreciation such as understate depreciation, hence overstating the earnings power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>amortization charges of oil and mining companies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>depletion charges of mining companies</strong>
<ul>
<li>depletion represents the using up of capital assets by turning them into products for sale. It applies to companies producing metals, oil and gas, sulphur, timber, etc… As the holdings, or reserves, of these products are gradually exhausted, their value must gradually be written-off through charges against earnings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>independent calculation by investor necessary</strong>: in mining, the investor must ordinarily compute his own depletion allowances for his share of the mining property.</li>
<li><strong>depletion and similar charges in the oil industry:</strong>
<ul>
<li>in the oil industry depletion charges are closer related to the actual cost of doing business. Large oil producer normally spends substantial sums of capital each year on new leases and new wells. This is needed to make up for the shrinkage of reserves throughout continued production. In general, depletion charges are cash outlays for the purpose of maintaining reserves and production.</li>
<li>Graham then provides an assessment of how some oil companies would misrepresent the actual life time of the asset by extending or shortening the depletion and depreciation of their assets. This was typically exercised so the company could control the market price through earnings manipulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>the meaning of these variations to the analyst and the investor</strong>
<ul>
<li>analyst should seek to apply a uniform and reasonably conservative rate of amortization that reflects realities of fixed assets.
<ul>
<li>depreciation on tangible assets. This should always be applied to cost - or to a figure substantially less than cost.</li>
<li>intangible drilling costs. Capitalizing these costs, and then writing them off as oil is produced, is the preferable basis for comparative purposes and to supply a fair reflection of current earnings.</li>
<li>property retirement and abandoned leases. A loss on property should be charged against the year’s earnings, rather than gainst surplus.</li>
<li>depletion of oil reserves. The proper principle here is that the analyst should allow for depletion based on the current market values of the oil.
<ul>
<li>in the case of integrated oil companies, accept the company’s depletion figure as the best available.</li>
<li>in the case of companies that are solely or virtually oil producers, the analyst can compute what the market is paying for the total developed oil reserves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>other types of amortization of capital assets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>leaseholds and leasehold improvements</strong>
<ul>
<li>if a lessee is renting a property at the large discount to the actual cost of owing the property - and the terms of the contract are over a long period of time - there maybe significant value to account for.</li>
<li>oil lands are leased on a standard royalty basis, usually one-eighth of the production. Such leaseholds can be worth much more than the rental payments involved. If a company has paid money for a given leasehold, the cost is regarded as a capital investment that should be written off during the life of the lease. These charges are in reality part of the rent paid for the property, and must therefore be included in the current operating expense.</li>
<li>when leased property is improved with assets fixed by the leese, the cost must be written down to nothing during the life of the lease. This is due to the landlord ultimately owning the property and the tethered asset when the lease expires. The annual expense for this purpose is called “amortization of leasehold improvements.” Chain-store enterprises, and consequently the annual write-offs may be of significant importance in their income statements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>amortization of patent</strong>: in theory, a patent should be dealt with the same way as a mining property; i.e, its cost to the investor should be written off against earnings during its remaining life.</li>
<li><strong>amortization of goodwill</strong>: in modern accounting. Goodwill is continually tested for impairment, but isn’t amortized.</li>

<ul>
<li>inadequate depreciation revealed by transfer from surplus and reserves such as in the case of Brooklyn Union Gas.</li>
<li><strong>variety of depreciation policies</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Depreciation Proper</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Straight-line method</em>: each class of depreciable property is written down by equal annual charges during the period of its estimated life</li>
<li><em>sinking-fund method</em>: the effect of this method is to make the deductions somewhat smaller in the earlier years and correspondingly higher in the later years. This is because depreciation is assumed to earn interest until the property is retired.</li>
<li><em>the over-all method</em>: single annual percentage to the entire depreciable property account is used, instead of varying rates to different classes of assets. The object is to arrive at a simple approximation of the actual depreciation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>retirement reserve methods</em>
<ul>
<li>the intention of a retirement reserve is to have funds available when an asset retires. Over any long period of time, proper depreciation and proper retirement allowances should yield the same results. In reality the majority of retirement reserve policies operate simply to understate the current loss of property value and thus to overstate the earnings.</li>
<li>various methods of calculating retirement reserves are:
<ul>
<li><em>percentage of gross</em>. this method would tend to approximate a regular depreciation rate if the percentage take were adequate. Generally this is not the case.</li>
<li><em>fixed rate per unit of product</em>. This method resembles the previous and is subject to the same criticism. Instead of a percentage of gross product, an example used is $2.7 in depreciation for every thousand kilowatt hours sold.</li>
<li><em>Over-all percentage of Gross for maintenance and depreciation combined</em>. By this method, the larger the amount spent for maintenance, the smaller the amount saved in a reserve for depreciation.</li>
<li><em>discretionary deductions</em>. The annual deduction is largely based on the judgement of the management. It might be the same or varying amount from year to year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>double accounting policies on depreciation.</strong>
<ul>
<li>regardless of what method is followed in the annual reports, practically every company follows the straight-line basis of depreciation in computing its income tax. As a result, the investor must determine whether the depreciation is representative of the linear or non-linear erosion that takes place on the value of the asset over time</li>
<li><em>Reasons for accepting, in general, the income tax base</em>. Graham presents 5 major reasons for accepting the income tax figure rather than the income statement as basis of depreciation:
<ul>
<li>the straight-line basis follows a definite and logical accounting theory. If there is an excessive deduction, the Treasure Department wont’ accept it.</li>
<li>the inadequacy of the “retirement reserve” idea in general, has been shown by the necessity in many cases of making large transfers from surplus to support the retirement reserve.</li>
<li>Since 1934, there has been an almost universal increase in the retirement allowances. This can be perceived as a strong indicator that past allowances were too small and therefore an overstatement of earnings.</li>
<li>a number of state commissions and the federal commissions have now ordered companies within their jurisdictions to follow the income tax depreciation base.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>instance when income tax basis should be rejected or questioned.</em> while Graham in general believes in accepting income tax basis, there may be times when figures in the annual report should be accepted, or even to seek a third basis.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>problem indicated by hypothetical example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>typical market appraisals
<ul>
<li>a company with a less valuable assets in terms of accounting is worth considerable more than the company with a higher value asset. This is done by a single gesture of writing down company C’s assets to almost nothing immediately upon the purchase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>a more rational approach</em>. a more practical approach would be to include the fair value of the respective assets and add that to the cash holdings. The investor might consider which depreciation method that should be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>practical application of foregoing reasoning.</strong> depreciation is not a cash outlay but deducted as an expense on the income statement. As a result, the company is reporting no income, yet the cash account continues to grow because displayed income is being off-set by depreciation charges.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>how to determine the proper depreciation charge</em> the investor or the analyst must come up with an estimate for depreciation which aligns with the actual conditions of the business (based on the discoverable facts).</li>
<li><em>concept of expended depreciation</em>. The primary reason for reducing a company’s depreciation charges is because it doesn’t properly reflect the company’s cash flow. In short, as an asset’s life continues to get older, the value that it is listed for on the company’s balance sheet will continue to decrease. As a result, an investor should see the value of tangible and intangible assets slowly decrease in value over time.</li>
<li><em>long-term depreciation a form of obsolescence</em>. for instance a plant may not be wearing out, but rather being obsolete due to changes in the industry and the status of the corporation. This risk is rather due to the investment and not accounting, hence it should be incorporated in the price and not in the depreciation, as it is a business risk. Therefore, the carrying value of asset should be adjusted accordingly. This value test for asset impairment should be conducted quarterly by the company’s management.</li>
<li><em>application of foregoing in determining earning power</em>. for companies that are similar to a railroad, only the expended depreciation should be deducted from earnings due to maintenance, renewals and repair to a large degree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>depreciation on apartment and office buildings</strong>. In short, the asset can’t be depreciated for more than the price that was paid to acquire it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>inadequate allowance for depreciation</strong>. Assets should not be written down in large amounts early in the assets life simply to make the earnings-power appear more abundant during the assets final years of life. This represents the true cash flow of the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>stock watering reversed</strong>. This manipulation of asset value by writing the book value up and down is interrelated with the value of the stock. This would inflate the stock prices by the higher book value of the fixed assets (known as <em>stock watering</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the purchases’s amortization calculation</strong>. Where the life of a mining property is limited, the investor’s own calculation of amortization should be deducted from earnings. He can base this on three factors 1) the price paid for the mining property. 2) the earnings before depreciation and depletion 3) the minimum life of the mine, and alternatively, the probability of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>purchaser amortization of oil reserves</strong>. depreciation and depletion charges per barrel are found by dividing the estimated remaining oil reserves into the net value of the properties on the books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>purchaser’s amortization of patents</strong>.</p>

Asset Value</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To gauge asset value, inspect the business’s balance sheet. A firm’s book value per share equals the total value of its tangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. Wall Street has almost entirely superseded the importance of asset value with earnings. Although rules of thumb for the proper ratio of market price to book value vary, you still should investigate the underlying value of a business’s assets before investing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current-asset value – that is, current assets minus liabilities – is perhaps a more important number. It excludes both intangible assets and fixed assets and is, therefore, a rough approximation of the value of the company should it go in to liquidation. As a general rule, if a firm’s market price is below its liquidation value, the company has either been undervalued or it should be liquidated. Investors who can distinguish between the undervalued issues and the ones performing poorly due to fundamental unsoundness can realize a significant upside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, examine the balance sheet to make sure that the company has an adequate cash position, that its current assets (exclusive of inventories) at least equal its current liabilities, and that it does not have a large amount of debt maturing soon, which could create refinancing problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there should be no discount from the amount stated on the company’s books for cash and marketable securities, provided the securities are short term or marked to the market. The same holds true for property, plant, and equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>economic value of the assets is the reproduction costs of a new firm starting out in the same industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>we first find the current market prices for the securities. Then we must adjust the book value of the firm’s accounts receivable and inventory up or down to get a more realistic reproduction costs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is important to note that goodwill represents a prior blunder that must be ignored when calculating the intrinsic value of a company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>liabilities and equity are the sources of funds that support the assets, which are the uses to which those funds are put</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are 3 types of liabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>those that arise from the normal conduct of the business</li>
<li>those that arise from past circumstances that are not pertinent to a new entrant</li>
<li>the outstanding formal debt of the company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>when we start with the reproduction cost of the assets and then subtract the first 2 categories of liabilities, we are left with the asset value of the whole enterprise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defining character of a franchise is that it enables a firm to earn more than it needs to pay for the investments that fund its assets. The intrinsic value of a firm is either the reproduction costs of the assets, which should equal the EPV or those assets plus the competitive advantages of the firm that underlie its franchise. The initial judgment that has to be made is whether the firm currently has a competitive advantage, and, if so, how strong and sustainable it is</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The interests of shareholders and those of management do not always coincide. Most shareholders defer to the wisdom of management without demanding their rights as owners of the business. In the case of companies whose common stocks sell for less than the liquidating value, the shareholders may be best served by the liquidation of the company, but that would put management out of a job, so shareholders cannot depend on management to make the right decision. Investors need to educate themselves about management practices and take these lessons into account when making investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember, however, that “analysis connotes the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic. It is part of the scientific method. But in applying analysis to the field of securities, [you will] encounter the serious obstacle that investment is by nature not an exact science.” Still, professional analysis is “not only useful, but indispensable.”</p>

<ul>
<li>failure to distinguish one from another has led to tragedies.</li>
<li>investments are bonds, outright purchases, permanent holding, for income, in safe securities.</li>
<li>speculations are stocks, purchases on margin, for a “quick turn”, for profit, in risky issues.</li>
<li>specific standards have to be applied to give meaning to the term “safety”</li>
<li>an investment operation promises the safety of the principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.</li>
<li>an investment operation is one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.</li>
<li>investment is founded on the past and present, speculation relies on the future to improve.</li>
<li>for the investor, the future is to be guarded against rather than profit from.</li>
<li>for the speculator, he anticipates the future will be better than the past.</li>
<li>“intelligent speculation” is taking a measured risk that seems justified after analysis</li>
<li>“unintelligent speculation” is taking a risk without adequate examination of the situation</li>
<li>safety is measured in terms of the ability of the issuer to meet obligations
<ul>
<li>that ability should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>lack of safety is not compensated by high dividends</li>
<li>Avoiding trouble is better than seeking protection after it occurs.</li>
<li>a sound investment must be able to withstand adversity. Enterprises that have withstood adversity may be favored by investors.</li>
<li>investment for profit, where growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable.</li>
<li>the investor of small means may opt to step out of his role and become a speculator. He may also opt to regret his actions.</li>

<p>“You cannot make a quantitative deduction to allow for an unscrupulous management; the only way to deal with such situations is to avoid them.”</p>
<p>“Undervalued investment issues may be discovered in any period by means of assiduous search.”</p>
<p>“The investor cannot safely judge the merits or demerits of a security by his personal reaction to the kind of business in which it is engaged.”</p>
<p>“An institution with securities of its own to sell cannot be looked to for entirely impartial guidance.”</p>
<p>“Needless to say, an investor is never forced to buy a security of inferior grade.”</p>
<p>“An investment in the soundest type of enterprise may be made on unsound and unfavorable terms.”</p>
<p>“Safety does not reside in titles, or forms, or legal rights, but in the values behind the security issue.”</p>
<p>“The fact that no good bonds are available is hardly an excuse for either issuing or accepting poor ones.”</p>
<p>“Whatever benefits a business benefits its owners, provided the benefit is not conferred upon the corporation at the expense of the stockholders.”</p>

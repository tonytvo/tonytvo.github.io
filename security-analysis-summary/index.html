<li>The three main classes of security are “investment bonds and preferred stocks,” “speculative bonds and preferred stocks,” and “common stocks.”</li>
<li>An issuer’s financial strength and ability to pay to determine its bonds’ safety.</li>

<li>Privileged issues have the safety of preferred stocks, but they also have the upside potential of common stocks.</li>
<li>Portfolio diversification can offset the variability of common stock prices.</li>
<li>As an investor, you should evaluate common stocks based on dividends, earnings and asset values.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Security analysis is the process of deciding which securities are sound investments. True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that does not meet these criteria is speculation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>common obstacles to analyst</p>
<ul>
<li>inadequate or incorrect data</li>
<li>uncertainties of future</li>
<li>irrational behaviour of the market</li>
<li>“in the short term, market is a voting machine, but in the long term, it tracks value.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 functions of analysis</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Descriptive function</strong>
<ul>
<li>collecting important facts and presenting them in an understandable manner. This would reveal:
<ul>
<li>reveal strong and weak points</li>
<li>make comparisons with similar issues</li>
<li>appraise for future performance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Selective Function</strong>
<ul>
<li>express specific judgment by determining whether an issue should be bought, held, sold, etc.</li>
<li>common approach is to analyze the company’s ability to earn and make payments to the investor.</li>
<li>Intrinsic value is the estimated valuation based on the analyst’s opinion of the intrinsic worth of the security from different sources of information such as assets, earnings, dividends, growth, management, etc…
<ul>
<li>the value of a business can be analyzed from the perspective of multiple earnings (P/E ratio, “earnings power”). It is cautioned that valuing a business solely from the earnings power is risky and uncharacteristic of wise analysts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Critical Function</strong>
<ul>
<li>“Analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts.”</li>
<li>should seek adequate protective provisions (margin of safety) in bonds and preferred stocks.</li>
<li>must be alert to the misrepresentation by accountants and management’s bad practices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Market analysis, in contrast to security analysis, attempts to forecast prices of individual securities or the action of the whole market without referring to underlying facts about individual companies. One type of market analysis, called technical analysis, refers only to past market values to predict future values. The second type of analysis refers to indices of economic activity outside the market that, presumably, have some influence over security prices. Neither of these kinds of market analysis has proven effective, and both essentially promote speculation over reasoned, fact-based investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intrinsic value is an important concept for security analysis. However, “intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms, it is understood to be that value justified by the facts…the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct…from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excess.” Although investors cannot calculate an exact intrinsic value for a given security because so many variables are involved, a careful examination can determine whether the price the market quotes is appropriate. Securities that meet stringent safety tests and appear to be selling well below their intrinsic value can often be profitable investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Securities traditionally fall into two categories: stocks and bonds. This classification is inadequate because it pays more attention to the form of security than to its safety and purpose. The various types of securities may be more accurately classified into three groups, each of which has its criteria for what constitutes a sound investment: fixed-value securities, including high-grade bonds and preferred stocks; variable-value senior securities, including speculative bonds and preferred stocks; and common stocks.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Bonds are not automatically safe investments because of their form. Instead, the soundness of a bond investment derives from the issuer’s ability to pay, which is, in turn, based on its financial strength. Therefore, the investor considering purchasing a bond should ask the following questions: Is the value of the company’s business more than its debts? Can the company meet its financial obligations even in the worst-case scenario, such as a recession or depression?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although no company or industry is depression-proof, two factors contribute to a company’s resilience in hard times: dominant size within its industry and sufficient earnings to cover its bond interest by a large margin. Bonds of companies that do not meet these requirements are not considered investment grade, even if the yield is highly attractive. A high yield cannot compensate for failure to pay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preferred stocks combine the limited return of bonds with the instability of common stocks. Despite these unattractive features, preferred stocks can be safe investments if they meet the same safety requirements as a bond, and their margin of safety is large enough that management is unlikely to suspend preferred dividends. The stability of the company exceeds that required for a bond investment. These stringent requirements limit the number of investment-grade preferred stocks to a very select group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Income bonds, also called adjustment bonds, should be subject to the same strict investment criteria as preferred stocks. Guaranteed issues occupy a position between bond debt and preferred stocks. Prospective investors must carefully examine the terms of the guarantee and evaluate the guarantor’s financial strength. Even with fixed-value investments, investors should periodically evaluate their holdings. There is no such thing as a permanent investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although many bonds and preferred stocks do not meet the requirements that would qualify them as investment grade, some issues in this category may be worth purchasing because they are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Investors must avoid issues that are selling at a discount for other reasons – for example, because the company is financially unsound.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>avoid compromising the assumed risk for an increased reward to minimize the loss of principal
<ul>
<li>if risk is assumed, it should be in the form of paying a cheaper price (therefore lowering the principal required to acquire the security), instead of accepting a higher coupon or dividend.</li>

<ul>
<li>safety is measured by the ability of the issuer to meet obligations - not by contractual rights</li>
<li>in theory, if a business fails, the bond holder recovers his money from assets; but that often fails because:
<ul>
<li>property values shrink when the business fails</li>
<li>there is difficulty in establishing legal rights</li>
<li>there are inherent delays in receivership</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to avoid trouble is better seeking protection after it occurs</li>
<li>debt should bed assessed from the cashflow statement
<ul>
<li>“good” debt is when company is using financed capital for an opportunity or expansion that might require a quick entry to the market</li>
<li>“bad” debt is when the business is required to borrow in order to sustain operations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>bonds should be bought on their ability to withstand a depression or recession; relative safety is found in companies of a) dominant size, and b) substantial margin or earnings over bond interests.</li>
<li>presumption of safety based upon either the character of the industry or the mount of protection</li>
<li>investor should look for industries least likely to be affected by a depression.</li>
<li>investment practice recognizes importance of character of the industry. <strong>historically some industries and public utilities have been more stable than others, and equally their degree of stability has altered with time</strong>. This changing dynamic must be considered when assessing an organization’s ability to continue meeting future payments on fixed income securities</li>
<li>depression performance as a test of merit.</li>
<li>various causes of bond collapses
<ul>
<li>excessive funded debt of utilities: defaults were causes by over-extended debt, not by lack or earnings</li>
<li>stability of railroad earnings overrated: such as diminished earnings a failure to recognize changes in transportation methods</li>
<li>unavailability of sound bonds no excuse for buying poor ones. The investor should never be tempted by the lack of a good opportunity to venture into a poor one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there are 2 incorrect theories:
<ul>
<li>that issuing a bond is a statement of financial weakness</li>
<li>bonds are only issued when companies cannot issue stock</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>proper theory of bond financing: A reasonable amount of funded debt is an advantage (typically rooted in the company’s ability to take their product or service to market quickly). if the company need to issue debt to simply pay their bills and expenses, this is a signal that the bond is unsafe.</li>
<li>significance of the foregoing to the investor: whenever there is money available to invest, it is invested. when higher yielding securities disappear from the market place, analysts need to accept a lower yielding security to ensure the protection of principal instead of choosing more yield in a second rate issue.</li>

<ul>
<li>lack of safety is not compensated by a high dividend or coupon</li>
<li>no mathematical relationship between yield and risk: prices and yields often depend on popularity. Graham suggests that the public’s familiarity with the issuing company and its ability to be quickly sold on the market is a considerable factor in the market price of bonds</li>
<li>the factor of cyclical risks: an insurance company spreads risk over a large field; the investor has only a small field and cannot afford a program entailing a small sample size with large risk</li>
<li>risk and yield are incommensurable. Graham mentions, yet again, that the analyst should not pay a par value for a risky bond that has a high yield. Instead, he should pay a considerable discount below the par value, therefore minimizing his risk of principal.</li>
<li>reversal of customary procedure recommended: don’t start with inspecting the safest fixed income issues on a list and work down. Instead, start with the security that represents a minimal threshold of safety and work up on the list. This way the analyst protects themselves from going deeper into the list - likely resulting in the purchase of an unsafe issue.</li>

<ul>
<li>Graham recommends the implementation of similar rules and regulations that savings banks use for fixed income investments, since they are required and obligated by law to minimize their expose to risk.</li>

<li>obligations of foreign governments
<ul>
<li>Graham agreed with the decision to disallow the purchase of foreign bonds for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>the factor of political expediency</li>
<li>the foreign trade argument</li>
<li>the individual record argument: it is suggested some countries are more creditworthy than others. Graham argues that only Canada, Holland, and Switzerland demonstrated “unquestionable investing ratings” during his era</li>
<li>two-fold objection to purchase foreign government bonds. Generally speaking, foreign bonds should be avoided for 2 reasons
<ul>
<li>the basis for obtaining credit is fragile</li>
<li>the past performance is unsatisfactory. Graham then provides Canada as the sole exception to his doubts</li>
</ul>

<li>income bonds in weaker position than debentures. Debentures are required to make payments; where as income bonds are not required to make payments. As a result, Graham believes the mandatory coupon payment for a debenture provides less risk to the holder than an income bond.</li>

<li>investor should not take higher return for risk, instead they should pay a lower principal. For examples, when a municipal government issues new bonds at higher interest rates, because of the risk of default, the investor should be skeptical of such investments</li>

<ul>
<li>the soundness of the bond rests on the ability of the issuing corporation to support its financial obligations, and much less on the potential value of its property for a lien. With that in mind, there is no purpose in devising a minimal pledged level of property value to support the bond.</li>
<li><strong>special types of obligations</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>equipment obligations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>equipment trust certificates may be issued against specific items of use by the corporation, for instance, again, a car. Although these certificates promise safety at time of sale, the debtor may only receive 50% of what he expects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>collateral-trust bonds</strong>
<ul>
<li>these are bonds that are secured by common stock or other bonds, often of the same corporation.</li>
<li>these bonds offer very little security if issued from the same corporation or subsidiary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>real estate bonds</strong>
<ul>
<li>the value of the property is often directly related to the success of the corporation.</li>
<li>property values and earning power closely related. Graham forcefully cautions investor that this is not true for buildings that were erected for special purposes and manufacturing</li>
<li>misleading character of appraisals</li>
<li>abnormal rental used as basis of valuation</li>
<li>debt based on excessive construction costs: over-valuation led to over-building which raised construction costs. When the market caught up, the loan against the expensive costs could not be supported.</li>
<li>weakness of specialized buildings such as hospital or factory</li>
<li>values based on initial rentals misleading: rentals obtained on a new building are higher that can be obtained for an old building. The duration of the bond issue needs to account for a declining premium for rent due to the age of the building</li>
<li>suggested rules of procedure
<ul>
<li>for single family dwellings, the lender should be sure the amount lent is not more than two thirds the value of the property as determined by the market assessment.</li>
<li>the lender should fully understand the costs associated with constructing the property and not exceed the mortgage by 50%</li>
<li>there should be conservatively structured income account that accounts for vacancies and a building that doesn’t fetch the premium of a newly constructed property. This account should demonstrate quality coverage over the net income.</li>

<ul>
<li>all combined mortgage debt will be less than 60% of the assessed property value</li>

<li>
<p><strong>equity test of doubtful merit in the case of utilities</strong></p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>importance of a real-value coverage behind a bond issue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham encourages the analyst to ensure the “going concern value” (or market price if the company could be sold as a whole unit) is substantially higher than the funded debt. He really challenges the analyst to look at the value of the business itself instead of the value of its individual pieces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>shareholders’ equity measured by market value of stock issues - a supplemental test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham states that a company that has a large market price compared to its total debt is far safer than a company that has a lower market price that closely resembles its total debt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>minima for the stock-equity test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>public utilities -> earnings should be 1.75 times the interest of the debt. Market price of stock should be at least 50% of the total debt</li>
<li>railroads -> earnings should be 2 times the interest of the debt. Market price of stock should be 66% of the total debt</li>
<li>industrials -> earnings should be 3 times for industrials. Market price of stock should be 100% of the total debt</li>
<li>these tests were developed for determining the safety of a bond, not a common stock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>income bonds equivalent to stock equity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>since interest on income bonds (issues that aren’t required to pay coupons) is not a fixed charge, it should not be included in the total charges on which coverage is calculated. Similarly, the principal amount of such bonds is not to be included in the total funded debt, instead it is to be compared with the stock equity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>significance of unusually large stock-value ratio</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the consideration of a bond’s security is primarily based on its coverage ratio (earnings compared to fixed interest charges) and its ratio of stock value to total bonded debt.</li>
<li>the coverage ratio provides the coverage of the coupon payment and the ratio of stock value to total bonded debt provides indicator whether the par value can be repaid. When either one of these ratios are uncharacteristically high while the other is low, it’s possible that the issue is still safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>stock-value ratio for railroad and public utility companies.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>applying a stock value ratio to railroads and public utility companies is difficult because of rental obligations and preferred stock of subsidiaries that rank before the parent company’s bonds. Regardless of those difficulties, Graham states that close attention to the stock-value ratio would have prevented major mistakes by bond investors in 1935-1937</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>stock-value test not to be modified to reflect changing market conditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Analysts might be inclined to make the stock-value ratio adjustable with changing market conditions (because it uses the current market price). For example, during a bull market, market prices are higher but the total debt of a bond is fixed. Therefore a ratio of 2:1 should potentially be increased to 3:1 during growing market prices. Graham suggests practical application is too difficult to implement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>summary of minimum quantitative requirements suggested for fixed-value investment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it’s important to note that the following recommendations were from the 1930’s</li>
<li>size of the issuing organization: Municipal bonds should be from a local government with more than 10000 tax paying citizens. For businesses, they should produce annual gross revenues of $2 million for public utilities, $3 million for railroads, and $5 million for industrials</li>
<li>interest coverage: this is the comparison of earnings to fixed debt obligations. The seven years average interest coverage for each of the following enterprises are 1.75 times the fixed debt for public utility bonds, 2 times for railroad bonds, 3 times for industrial bonds, 2 times for real estate bonds.</li>
<li>value of property: the fair value of property should be more than 50% of the bond’s par value</li>
<li>market value of the stock issues: this is a comparison of the company’s stock market price to its total bonded debt. The stock price should be at least 50% of a public utilities bonded debt, 66% of a railroad’s bonded debt, and 100% of an industrial’s bonded debt.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Graham encourages investors to find companies with large levels of working capital because it displays a healthy organization that can meet future debt obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>parent company only vs consolidated return</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham identifies his deep distrust for the parent company’s operational subsidiary relationship, with respect to how the income statement is reported. He briefly describes and shows on a chart how the coverage ratio is drastically different when the income statement is viewed from the consolidated report to the “parent company only” report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>dividends on preferred stocks of subsidiaries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham provides an example where a parent company fails and goes into receivership. Prior to the failure, the parent company had a subsidiary that was paying a preferred share dividend. After the failure, the dividend was immediately discontinued. The event left the bond holder (debenture holder) of the parent company empty handed. The example demonstrates an importance for thoroughly understanding the prioritization of this structure and an importance for having a backed security.
<ul>
<li>subsidiaries’ bond interest</li>
<li>subsidiaries’ preferred dividends</li>
<li>parent company’s bond interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>minority interest in common stock of subsidiaries.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the earnings of minority stock are usually deducted in the income statement after the parent company’s bond interest, therefore, it does not reduce the margin of safety calculation. Graham suggests subtracting the minority interest before calculating the interest coverage for a more conservative estimate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>capitalization of fixed charges for railroads and utilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the railroad industry may lease their railroad cars from other businesses. These leases hold considerable fixed expenses on the company and ultimately impact the health of the bonds the company has issued.</li>
<li>after identifying this concern, Graham recommends a rule of thumb for multiplying the fixed charges on the income statement by 22. This would provide capitalization of 4.5% on all the fixed charges. This was determined by taking the inverse of 22. It’s important to note that interest rates for railroad debts during 1938 were 4.5%. Therefore, this technique could be applied to any industry where fixed charges have numerous variables.</li>
<li>it would be important to adjust the capitalization rate based on the average rates for bonds in that industry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the working-capital factor in the analysis of industrial bonds</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it’s important that a company has excess current assets compared to current liabilities. This excess is called the working capital.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3 requisites with respect to working capital</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>when assessing the working capital, Graham suggests 3 items should be evaluated

<ul>
<li>
<p>Some senior securities carry certain privileges that make them attractive purchases on a speculative basis, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Convertible issues” – In certain cases, investors can exchange convertible issues for common stock.</li>
<li>“Participating issues” – Investors can receive part of any increased dividend that common stockholders earn.</li>
<li>“Subscription-warrant issues” – These include option warrants to purchase common stock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These issues combine the increased safety of a senior security and the possible price appreciation of common stock. However, as with bonds, the attractive form does not mean that all securities of this type are safe. Only a limited number of such issues meet investment-grade safety requirements; the remainder belong to the same category as common-stock investments, because they share that category’s speculative features. When evaluating privileged issues, consider the amount of the profit-sharing benefits per dollar invested, the proximity of the event that will trigger profit-sharing advantages and the duration of the privileges.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Common stocks, as a class, are much more speculative than senior issues. Yet they are important to the US financial system, and novice and expert investors alike eagerly follow their prices, so security analysts know how to deal with them. The false belief that common stocks were a good buy at any price – as long as the company’s earning trend was positive – partly fueled the crash of 1929. Clearly the practice of making common-stock investments safer deserves further analysis, because the possibility of significant price appreciation will always lure investors to this type of security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the instability of common stock prices makes any given organization a dubious investment, portfolio diversification can offset this risk to some extent. Investors should subject their common stocks portfolios to thorough analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncertainty regarding future growth is usually the main reason why value estimations based on present value calculations are so prone to error</p>

<ul>
<li>investment in common stock is often speculative and analysis may be inconclusive and unsatisfactory.
<ul>
<li>common stock are of basic importance and of enormous interest</li>
<li>the owners of the common stock with to know their value</li>
<li>human nature often masks logic behind an endless cycle of greed for profit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>history of common stock analysis</strong>: over the previous 30 years (from 1910-1940), common stocks have become more favored due to their substantial earnings and dividends. With more and more companies providing detailed financial information, investors have had statistical data to substantiate their investments. During 1927-1929, Graham says most investors neglected this analysis and simply purchased more common stock based on speculative greed for profit and prophecy</li>
<li><strong>analysis vitiated by 2 types of instability</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Graham suggests 2 types of instability will destroy the analysis of common stock:
<ul>
<li>instability of tangibles aspect</li>
<li>an enormous importance placed on intangible aspects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a company’s market price was generally stable and predictable if the companies had the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>the company paid a reasonable and consistent dividend</li>
<li>earnings were stable and averaged a substantial margin over dividend</li>
<li>each dollar of market price was backed by actual assets of equal value on the balance sheet - Or in other words, the book value was similar to the market price</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>prewar (WW1) conception of investment in common stocks</strong>
<ul>
<li>prior to the world war, the analyst was primarily concerned with finding common stocks that paid consistent dividends and possessed stable earnings. In general, most emphasis was placed on past performance and little on future earnings growth.</li>
<li>speculation characterized by emphasis on future prospects</li>
<li>technique of investing in common stocks resembled that for bonds</li>
<li>buying common stocks viewed as taking a share in a business
<ul>
<li>if a businessman were going to purchase an entire company outright, he would likely start with the net worth of all the assets (or equity on the balance sheet), and then consider if the choice produced adequate earnings for the price. After looking at the earnings that the company produced, the investor would decide if he was willing to pay a premium or discount to that par value (or book value)</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>the new era theory</strong>
<ul>
<li>during the roaring 1920’s, there’s idea that value of common stocks was completely dependent on what it will earn in the future. This new thesis had three supporting insights:
<ul>
<li>the dividend holds little emphasis on the value</li>
<li>the relationship between asset value and earnings power had little significance</li>
<li>the past earnings were of little significant value except when signifying momentum in growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>cases for this changed viewpoint</strong>
<ul>
<li>in short, Graham thinks that the drastic change in common stock valuation stemmed from unpredictable results often seen from using historical data and the irresistible potential for profits that had occurred.</li>
<li>in the early 1930’s many liquidations occurred. These events often produced very little value for the fixed assets the companies had listed on their balance sheets. This experience also caused investors to abandon the emphasis on book value or net-work of assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>attention shifted to the trend of earnings</strong></li>
<li><strong>the common stocks as long term investments doctrine</strong>
<ul>
<li>few key points
<ul>
<li>the value was based on what the common stock could earn in the future</li>
<li>good common stocks have a rising earnings (or EPS)
<ul>
<li>what it excludes is the idea that a price is associated with the earnings one can expect to receive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>relies on an improvement in the stock’s future performance.</li>
<li>therefore making the approach <strong>speculative</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>new era investment equivalent to prewar speculation</strong></li>
<li><strong>stocks regarded as attractive irrespective of their prices</strong>: non-sense</li>
<li>investment trusts came to resemble this new doctrine
<ul>
<li>analysis abandoned by investment trusts. Graham voices his disgust for the professional investor who didn’t safe guard the capital of their customers due to a lazy assessment of facts and risk analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>a sound premise used to support an unsound conclusion</strong>
<ul>
<li>in 1924, a book by the name of common stocks as long-term investments, by edgar lawrence smith was published. the premise of the book is that common stocks outperform bonds because not all the earnings are paid to the owners as dividends. This retained earnings by the company makes the value of the common stock increase in market price. Although Graham agreed with the basic tenants of Edgar’s thesis, he strongly disagrees with the exaggeration many investors took in their application of his ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>average vs trend of earnings</strong>
<ul>
<li>Graham suggests that earnings trends and earning averages are nothing more than speculative tools for analysts to predict future results. In fact, companies that have accelerated growth demonstrate an untapped market for more competitors.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>secular expansion as basis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>have a diversified portfolio of common stocks</li>
<li>when recessions occur, the investor can still benefit in the common stock markets by 1) diversifying their portfolio, and 2) by adamantly rejecting common stocks trade for excessive premiums.</li>
<li>Graham says the investor cannot rely on historical earnings growth to provide safety and profit in the long haul. Specifically, he’s talking about companies that are commonly referred to as “growth picks”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>individual growth as basis of sections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>use quantitative and qualitative factor to determine the value of common stocks similarly to the techniques for bonds.</li>
<li>what are growth companies?
<ul>
<li>maybe a company whose earnings move forward from cycle to cycle.</li>
<li>maybe company’s earnings grow at a faster rate than the general market</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>can investor identify them?
<ul>
<li>no, typical investor can’t realistically determine when and where the company’s growth will eventually subside. As a result, there’s a strong chance that the investor might select the stock “at the top of the earnings wave”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>does the price discount the potential growth?
<ul>
<li>it’s difficult to determine the price to pay for the future earnings that haven’t been demonstrated yet.</li>
<li>it’s impossible to predict how much longer the earnings growth is going to take place. One thing almost everyone can agree is that high earnings growth (like 30%) is temporary and not sustainable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>may such purchases be described as investment commitments
<ul>
<li>can thorough analysis and thought go into the selection of the growth stock.
<ul>
<li>maybe yes, as some growth investors do conduct themselves appropriately</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>is the price paid for the investment something that a reasonable person would pay if they could buy the whole business?
<ul>
<li>if a person is willing to pay more than 20% more for a common stock than he would for outright ownership of the entire business, the pick become speculative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>utilize even more effort than bonds to assess the future outlook of common stocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>selection based on margin of safety principle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>factors complicating efforts to exploit general market swings
<ul>
<li>index of leading stocks were selected and analyzed as a group (like the S&#x26;P 500). Also a base or normal value for the group of stocks could be determined by taking their average earnings and capitalizing them at the going long term interest rate (like the 10 or 30 year federal bond). This is where Graham tell analysts that the intrinsic value of stocks is directly tied to interest rates.
<ul>
<li>this approach has 3 drawbacks
<ul>
<li>first, the general market patterns may be anticipated, but the actual buying and selling points may still be chosen poorly.</li>
<li>market behavior may change in the future and not response in the same manner as before</li>
<li>this approach requires a very determined and vigilant individual because his actions will be the opposite of human psychology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the undervalued individual issue approach:
<ul>
<li>likelihood of finding an individual common stock that possess the qualitative factors and the quantitative factors (compared to price) is rare. if this type of stock issue is found, Graham says it should be classified as an investment and not speculation.</li>
<li>Graham says the most important way to view the purchase of a common stock is if the investor could purchase the entire business at once.</li>

Dividends</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before investing in a common stock, investigate both the firm’s dividend rate and its history of paying dividends. The dividend rate is important, because a dollar of surplus earnings is worth more to the investor when the company chooses to pay it as a dividend instead of reinvesting it in the business. Generally, companies that pay higher dividends have higher stock prices. However, management can suspend common-stock dividends at any time, so it is important to view the company’s dividend history as an indication, but not a guarantee, of future income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extraordinary stock dividends</strong> (stock splits), on the other hand, are largely illusory, because they give investors nothing they did not already own. An improvement on this practice is for companies to pay periodic stock dividends, representing a return to the shareholders of surplus earnings reinvested in the business.</p>
<ul>
<li>although stock dividends and stock splits create no real value for the holders, much speculation about the value of the companies after the division is likely to occur due to the cheaper price.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>periodic stock dividends</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>with a periodic stock dividend, the shareholder often receives a smller and reasonable stock dividend that adds value over time.</li>
<li>company should not provide a periodic stock dividend if the amount exceeds the funds being retained in earnings. The dividend could eventually exceeded the company’s ability to retain earnings power and the EPS slowly declined over a 10 year period, along with the market price.</li>
<li>Graham suggests the dividend should be dispersed as a preferred share.
<ul>
<li>it doesn’t weaken the capital structure of the business like the common stock dividend.</li>
<li>allows the company to retain earnings until a safe and manageable surplus is realized.</li>
<li>this technique gives management flexibility and control to pay the dividend as long as they choose.</li>
<li>once the retained earnings have been distributed, the obligation is no longer on the books once the preferred share is repurchased by the company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graham suggests that the market price of common stocks will perform similarly if management pays a healthy and sustainable dividend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>established principle of withholding dividends</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham claims that 2 companies with the same general business model and the same earnings will trade at different prices if the dividend policy is different. The market will value the company with the higher dividend more favorably.</li>
<li>should a company pay a lower dividend in order to create stability for the owner with an assured payment, or should they pay a higher dividend and meet its obligation irregularly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the merits of “plowing back” earnings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>there’re 2 reasons retained earnings is beneficial to the stock holder.
<ul>
<li>whatever good for the company was good for the shareholder.</li>
<li>company that retained earnings had more agility to remain competitive in difficult markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if a company sustains a favorable ROE over a long period of time, it means the management is properly investing the retained earnings and adding value to the shareholder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>dividend policies arbitrary and sometimes selfishly determined</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham suggests that many board members are executives and friends of executives with very large portion of shares. As a result, they might want to minimize their personal tax burden by receiving smaller dividends from the company.</li>
<li>leadership may seek a larger and more impressive sized business, therefore, using retained earnings to full fill their pursuit of an ever growing business (which may or may not add more earnings)</li>
<li>management may seek the opportunity to purchase outstanding shares at lower prices with the retained earnings.</li>
<li>a management that pays a small dividend is able to pay excessive salaries to executives and top level employees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>arbitrary control of dividend policy complicates analysis of common stocks</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>suggested principle for dividend payments</strong>: Graham holds the strong opinion that a company should pay a large portion of their earnings to the shareholders. He says it’s more important for the shareholder to receive non-standard (or inconsistent) dividend rates at a higher return, instead of a lower and more consistent dividend, which likely results in the company accumulating reserves that add little value.</p>

Earnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To analyze earnings, carefully study the company’s income statement. While earnings are undoubtedly important, security analysts have accorded them too much weight in calculating a company’s investment soundness. Management can manipulate a company’s earnings many ways. Therefore, always examine the firm’s income statement with a critical eye. For example, businesses can engineer nonrecurring charges and profits to produce a favorable earnings trend. A firm’s accountants also can generate perceived earnings by lowering or increasing the company’s reserves, or by reporting subsidiaries’ results in different ways. Companies can also present depreciation and amortization costs in a misleading manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investors must pay attention to more than current earnings. They should consider both the earnings trend and the long-term earnings average – preferably seven to ten years, putting more weight on the latter number. The analyst’s job is not predicting the future of a trend or intuiting possible price changes; it is making decisions based on facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>analyst should combine the information from the balance sheet and income statement to garner the best valuation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>disadvantages of sole emphasis on earning power</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>earnings statement has more variability than the balance sheet and therefore changes the value of the business making it appear unstable, the income statement can be more misleading than the balance sheet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>simplified statement of Wall Street’s Method of appraising common stocks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>price = Current Earnings Per Share (EPS) x Quality Coefficient</li>
<li>how does quality coefficient is determined?
<ul>
<li>probably by whole host of factors such as dividend rate, history, size and reputation of the business. Graham suspects all these factors are dwarfed by the real factor, which is earnings trend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>earnings not only fluctuate but are subject to arbitrary determination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>some of the techniques management can use to misrepresent earnings in the short term are the following
<ul>
<li>through allocating items to surplus (on the balance sheet) instead of revenue</li>
<li>through misrepresented amortization charges</li>
<li>through an amendment of the capital structure</li>
<li>through the use of large capital funds for items that don’t pertain to the business</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>significance of foregoing to the analyst</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the end, the analyst should be able to answer 3 questions:
<ul>
<li>what are the true earnings for the period studied?</li>
<li>what indications does the earnings record carry as to the future earning power?</li>
<li>what standards should be applied to the income statement to arrive at a reasonable valuation?</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>general observations on the income account</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>accounting rules permit management a range of choices in recording non-recurrent and special items, selecting between income and surplus, such items may be:
<ul>
<li>profit or loss on sale of fixed assets</li>
<li>profit or loss on sale of marketable securities</li>
<li>discount or premium on retirement of capital obligations</li>
<li>proceeds of life insurance policies</li>
<li>tax refunds and interest on refunds</li>
<li>gain or loss from litigation</li>
<li>extraordinary write down of inventory</li>
<li>extraordinary write down of receivables</li>
<li>cost of maintaining non-operating properties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the above items must be separated from the ordinary operating results to indicate earning power clearly (what the company might be expected to earn if the business condition remained similar)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>non-recurrent items: profits or losses from sale of fixed assets</strong>: these are not to be shown in current net income, they should appear in the surplus account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>profit from sale of marketable securities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>must be separated from ordinary operating results</li>
<li>methods used by investment trusts in reporting sale of marketable securities: over-all changes in principal value are the only measure of an investment trust’s performance, and this cannot be equated with recorded earnings of an industrial corporation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>profits through repurchase of senior securities at a discount</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a corporation may buy back its own securities at less than par value; any gain made is non-recurring and should be recorded as such. This was a feature of depression years 1931-33</li>

<ul>
<li>as inventory losses are directly related to the conduct of the business, Graham suggests that it should not be treated as extraordinary</li>
<li><strong>manufactured earnings</strong>:
<ul>
<li>one example such as receivables and inventory written down to an artificially low “cost price”, which in turn will lead to a manufactured higher profit in the year to come. This illustrates the most vicious type of accounting manipulation: taking sums out of surplus, and then reporting these same sums as income in the following years. The danger of this accounting method is the public is not likely to recognize it, and even the expert analyst might have a hard time detecting it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>reserves for inventory loss</strong>
<ul>
<li>companies continuously set aside reserves to absorb losses on inventory before they occur. The implication is that the income statement does not always reflect inventory losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>other elements in inventory accounting</strong>
<ul>
<li>the standard procedure is to take inventory at the close of the year measured by the lowest of either cost price or market price.</li>
<li>last-in, first-out: measure the actual amount paid for the most recently acquired inventory. The theory behind this method is that a merchant’s selling price is related mainly to the current replacement price or the recent cost of the article sold. This method may be useful to reduce income tax, if there is inventory fluctuation.</li>
<li>the normal stock or basic-stock inventory method: a more radical method of minimizing fluctuations is the company must possess a certain physical stock of materials from year to year. This “permanent stock” would therefore keep the same value and not be imposed to any changes in price. In order to permit the base inventory to be carried at an unchanging figure on the balance sheet, the practice is to mark it down to a very low unit price, so low that it should never be necessary to reduce it further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>idle-plant expense</strong>: the cost of carrying non-operating properties is almost always charged against income, Graham suggests it should not. By doing so, it’s misleading to the expenses of the company’s core product or service. The analyst may properly consider idle-plant expense as belonging to a somewhat different from ordinary charges against operating income, as these expenses by nature are not part of the company’s normal operations.
<ul>
<li>in theory, these expenses should be temporary since the management can terminate these losses at any time by disposing of the property. therefore, if the company chose to spend the money, Graham does not deem it logical to consider these assets equivalent to a permanent liability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>deferred charges</strong>
<ul>
<li>a business sometimes incurs expenses which are applicable to a number of years rather than a single 12-month period such as:
<ul>
<li>organization expense (legal fees, etc…)</li>
<li>moving expenses</li>
<li>development expenses (for new products, processes, for opening up a mine, etc…)</li>
<li>discount on obligations sold</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the company is allowed to spread these types of costs over an appropriate period of years (5 years is a customary period of time). It is entered upon balance sheets as a deferred charges, which is written off by annual charges against earnings.</li>
<li>it is incorrect to write off these types of expenses in a single year, and against a ‘surplus’ as net income for coming years would be overstated, followed from the understated operating expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>amortization of bond discount</strong>
<ul>
<li>the discount should be amortized over the life of the bond by an annual charge against earnings.</li>
<li>the write-offs could be written against surplus to eliminate future annual deductions from earnings, and in that way to make the shares appear more valuable. This practice has aroused considerable criticism in recent years both from NYSE and from S.E.C</li>

Earnings of subsidiaries</h3>
<ul>
<li>if parent company has an unprofitable division, its losses must be shown as a deduction from normal earnings</li>
<li><strong>flagrant example of padded income accounts</strong>: on rare occasions management would include earnings in the income statement that have no existence.</li>
<li><strong>balance sheet and income-tax checks upon the published earnings statements</strong>
<ul>
<li>to check upon the reliability of the published earnings is to look at the amount of federal income tax accrued. The taxable profit can be calculated from the income-tax accrual, and this profit compared in turn with the earnings reported to stockholders. The two figures should not necessarily be the same, since the tax laws may give rise to a number of divergences. However, the wide differences should be noted and made the subject of further inquiry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>one cannot make a quantitative deduction to allow unscrupulous management; the only way to deal with such situations is to avoid them.</li>
<li><strong>subsidiary companies and consolidated reports</strong>
<ul>
<li>consolidated reports occur when an enterprise controls one or more operational subsidiaries so that it can disclose companies financial reports as a ‘group’ or one entity.</li>
<li>the important part for consolidation is to ensure nothing is counted twice, for example, the profit of the subsidiary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>special dividends paid by subsidiaries</strong>
<ul>
<li>parent companies can supplement their earnings through special dividends paid by their subsidiaries. This can be very misleading to an analyst and they need to account for this in their evaluation process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>broader significance of subsidiaries’ losses</strong>
<ul>
<li>should a subsidiary’s losses be represented on the parent company’s earnings?</li>
<li>should the analyst discount the value of parent company if they own an unprofitable interest in another company?</li>
<li>it is clear from the standpoint of proper accounting that as long as a company continues to control an unprofitable division, it’s losses must be shown as a deduction from normal earnings.</li>
<li>if the amount involved is significant, the analyst should investigate whether or not the losses may be subject to early termination</li>
<li>the analyst may consider all or part of subsidiary’s losses equivalent to nonrecurring items.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>leading questions relative to depreciation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if a capital asset has a limited life, provisions must be made to write off the cost of the asset by charges against earnings distributed over the period of the assets life.</li>
<li>three complications arise
<ul>
<li>accounting rules may permit a value other than cost to acquire the asset as the basis for amortization charges.</li>
<li>there are numerous ways company can execute their depreciation/amortization charges from the balance sheet to the income statement.</li>
<li>sometimes account rules allow companies to make depreciation charges which don’t represent the reality of assets depreciation over time. This makes the analysts job very difficult to assess capital expenditures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>depreciation base other than cost</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham suggests substitute the replacement value of all the fixed assets at a given date, while everything prior is depreciated according to current accounting standards.</li>
<li>in most cases, companies don’t place much interest in ensuring their depreciation charges are representative of their assets’ ever-changing replacement costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>mark-downs to reduce depreciation charges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham believes that excessive write-downs of fixed assets are inexcusable and should not be condoned by the accounting profession. Accountants should refuse to certify a report containing such mark-downs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>balance sheet-income account discrepancies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>prevalent in the case of mining and oil companies, is to mark up fixed assets and then fail to increase the correspondingly depreciation charges on the income statement. This is done to benefit from the higher valuation in their balance sheet, without accepting the burden of consequently higher depreciation charges against net income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the vast majority of industrial companies follow the standard policy or charing an appropriate depreciation rate against each class of depreciable assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when the analyst knows that a company’s depreciation policy differs from the standard, there is special reason to check the adequacy of the allowance. Comparison with a company in the same field may yield significant differences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>depreciation charges often an issue in mergers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>concealed depreciation such as understate depreciation, hence overstating the earnings power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>amortization charges of oil and mining companies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>depletion charges of mining companies</strong>
<ul>
<li>depletion represents the using up of capital assets by turning them into products for sale. It applies to companies producing metals, oil and gas, sulphur, timber, etc… As the holdings, or reserves, of these products are gradually exhausted, their value must gradually be written-off through charges against earnings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>independent calculation by investor necessary</strong>: in mining, the investor must ordinarily compute his own depletion allowances for his share of the mining property.</li>
<li><strong>depletion and similar charges in the oil industry:</strong>
<ul>
<li>in the oil industry depletion charges are closer related to the actual cost of doing business. Large oil producer normally spends substantial sums of capital each year on new leases and new wells. This is needed to make up for the shrinkage of reserves throughout continued production. In general, depletion charges are cash outlays for the purpose of maintaining reserves and production.</li>
<li>Graham then provides an assessment of how some oil companies would misrepresent the actual life time of the asset by extending or shortening the depletion and depreciation of their assets. This was typically exercised so the company could control the market price through earnings manipulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>the meaning of these variations to the analyst and the investor</strong>
<ul>
<li>analyst should seek to apply a uniform and reasonably conservative rate of amortization that reflects realities of fixed assets.
<ul>
<li>depreciation on tangible assets. This should always be applied to cost - or to a figure substantially less than cost.</li>
<li>intangible drilling costs. Capitalizing these costs, and then writing them off as oil is produced, is the preferable basis for comparative purposes and to supply a fair reflection of current earnings.</li>
<li>property retirement and abandoned leases. A loss on property should be charged against the year’s earnings, rather than gainst surplus.</li>
<li>depletion of oil reserves. The proper principle here is that the analyst should allow for depletion based on the current market values of the oil.
<ul>
<li>in the case of integrated oil companies, accept the company’s depletion figure as the best available.</li>
<li>in the case of companies that are solely or virtually oil producers, the analyst can compute what the market is paying for the total developed oil reserves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>other types of amortization of capital assets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>leaseholds and leasehold improvements</strong>
<ul>
<li>if a lessee is renting a property at the large discount to the actual cost of owing the property - and the terms of the contract are over a long period of time - there maybe significant value to account for.</li>
<li>oil lands are leased on a standard royalty basis, usually one-eighth of the production. Such leaseholds can be worth much more than the rental payments involved. If a company has paid money for a given leasehold, the cost is regarded as a capital investment that should be written off during the life of the lease. These charges are in reality part of the rent paid for the property, and must therefore be included in the current operating expense.</li>
<li>when leased property is improved with assets fixed by the leese, the cost must be written down to nothing during the life of the lease. This is due to the landlord ultimately owning the property and the tethered asset when the lease expires. The annual expense for this purpose is called “amortization of leasehold improvements.” Chain-store enterprises, and consequently the annual write-offs may be of significant importance in their income statements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>amortization of patent</strong>: in theory, a patent should be dealt with the same way as a mining property; i.e, its cost to the investor should be written off against earnings during its remaining life.</li>
<li><strong>amortization of goodwill</strong>: in modern accounting. Goodwill is continually tested for impairment, but isn’t amortized.</li>

<ul>
<li>inadequate depreciation revealed by transfer from surplus and reserves such as in the case of Brooklyn Union Gas.</li>
<li><strong>variety of depreciation policies</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Depreciation Proper</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Straight-line method</em>: each class of depreciable property is written down by equal annual charges during the period of its estimated life</li>
<li><em>sinking-fund method</em>: the effect of this method is to make the deductions somewhat smaller in the earlier years and correspondingly higher in the later years. This is because depreciation is assumed to earn interest until the property is retired.</li>
<li><em>the over-all method</em>: single annual percentage to the entire depreciable property account is used, instead of varying rates to different classes of assets. The object is to arrive at a simple approximation of the actual depreciation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>retirement reserve methods</em>
<ul>
<li>the intention of a retirement reserve is to have funds available when an asset retires. Over any long period of time, proper depreciation and proper retirement allowances should yield the same results. In reality the majority of retirement reserve policies operate simply to understate the current loss of property value and thus to overstate the earnings.</li>
<li>various methods of calculating retirement reserves are:
<ul>
<li><em>percentage of gross</em>. this method would tend to approximate a regular depreciation rate if the percentage take were adequate. Generally this is not the case.</li>
<li><em>fixed rate per unit of product</em>. This method resembles the previous and is subject to the same criticism. Instead of a percentage of gross product, an example used is $2.7 in depreciation for every thousand kilowatt hours sold.</li>
<li><em>Over-all percentage of Gross for maintenance and depreciation combined</em>. By this method, the larger the amount spent for maintenance, the smaller the amount saved in a reserve for depreciation.</li>
<li><em>discretionary deductions</em>. The annual deduction is largely based on the judgement of the management. It might be the same or varying amount from year to year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>double accounting policies on depreciation.</strong>
<ul>
<li>regardless of what method is followed in the annual reports, practically every company follows the straight-line basis of depreciation in computing its income tax. As a result, the investor must determine whether the depreciation is representative of the linear or non-linear erosion that takes place on the value of the asset over time</li>
<li><em>Reasons for accepting, in general, the income tax base</em>. Graham presents 5 major reasons for accepting the income tax figure rather than the income statement as basis of depreciation:
<ul>
<li>the straight-line basis follows a definite and logical accounting theory. If there is an excessive deduction, the Treasure Department wont’ accept it.</li>
<li>the inadequacy of the “retirement reserve” idea in general, has been shown by the necessity in many cases of making large transfers from surplus to support the retirement reserve.</li>
<li>Since 1934, there has been an almost universal increase in the retirement allowances. This can be perceived as a strong indicator that past allowances were too small and therefore an overstatement of earnings.</li>
<li>a number of state commissions and the federal commissions have now ordered companies within their jurisdictions to follow the income tax depreciation base.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>instance when income tax basis should be rejected or questioned.</em> while Graham in general believes in accepting income tax basis, there may be times when figures in the annual report should be accepted, or even to seek a third basis.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>problem indicated by hypothetical example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>typical market appraisals
<ul>
<li>a company with a less valuable assets in terms of accounting is worth considerable more than the company with a higher value asset. This is done by a single gesture of writing down company C’s assets to almost nothing immediately upon the purchase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>a more rational approach</em>. a more practical approach would be to include the fair value of the respective assets and add that to the cash holdings. The investor might consider which depreciation method that should be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>practical application of foregoing reasoning.</strong> depreciation is not a cash outlay but deducted as an expense on the income statement. As a result, the company is reporting no income, yet the cash account continues to grow because displayed income is being off-set by depreciation charges.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>how to determine the proper depreciation charge</em> the investor or the analyst must come up with an estimate for depreciation which aligns with the actual conditions of the business (based on the discoverable facts).</li>
<li><em>concept of expended depreciation</em>. The primary reason for reducing a company’s depreciation charges is because it doesn’t properly reflect the company’s cash flow. In short, as an asset’s life continues to get older, the value that it is listed for on the company’s balance sheet will continue to decrease. As a result, an investor should see the value of tangible and intangible assets slowly decrease in value over time.</li>
<li><em>long-term depreciation a form of obsolescence</em>. for instance a plant may not be wearing out, but rather being obsolete due to changes in the industry and the status of the corporation. This risk is rather due to the investment and not accounting, hence it should be incorporated in the price and not in the depreciation, as it is a business risk. Therefore, the carrying value of asset should be adjusted accordingly. This value test for asset impairment should be conducted quarterly by the company’s management.</li>
<li><em>application of foregoing in determining earning power</em>. for companies that are similar to a railroad, only the expended depreciation should be deducted from earnings due to maintenance, renewals and repair to a large degree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>depreciation on apartment and office buildings</strong>. In short, the asset can’t be depreciated for more than the price that was paid to acquire it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>inadequate allowance for depreciation</strong>. Assets should not be written down in large amounts early in the assets life simply to make the earnings-power appear more abundant during the assets final years of life. This represents the true cash flow of the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>stock watering reversed</strong>. This manipulation of asset value by writing the book value up and down is interrelated with the value of the stock. This would inflate the stock prices by the higher book value of the fixed assets (known as <em>stock watering</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the purchases’s amortization calculation</strong>. Where the life of a mining property is limited, the investor’s own calculation of amortization should be deducted from earnings. He can base this on three factors 1) the price paid for the mining property. 2) the earnings before depreciation and depletion 3) the minimum life of the mine, and alternatively, the probability of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>purchaser amortization of oil reserves</strong>. depreciation and depletion charges per barrel are found by dividing the estimated remaining oil reserves into the net value of the properties on the books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>purchaser’s amortization of patents</strong>. the question for investor is how much she is paying for the patent, when she buys the stock at a given price. This is the amount she must use for writing-off subsequent earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>general rule</em>. In reality no single calculation shown above will represent stocks wholistically. For big companies it is even harder since they have a bulk of patents and intangible items.</p>
</li>
<li>

<ul>
<li><strong>concept of earning power</strong>: which basically the average earnings per share, should be seen over a number of years. One should notice if the observed years are all surrounded by the average. This is preferred to very volatile earnings, as repeated occurrences are more impressive than a single occurrence.</li>
<li><strong>quantitative analysis should be supplemented by qualitative considerations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>quantitative data is useful only to the extent that’s supported by a qualitative survey of the enterprise</em></li>
<li>in steel company example, while current and past earnings are one thing, Graham aims to calculate ‘normal earnings’. He suggests that national output of steel and the market position should be considered as part of a qualitative analysis. Reported earnings cannot be viewed without relative factors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>current earnings should not be the primary basis of appraisal</strong>
<ul>
<li>current earnings governs the market price of common stock prices more than the long term average. While a private business might earn twice as much as their average years, their local market price would never be purchased based on the extraordinary year of earnings.</li>
<li>the market price typically corresponds very closely to the earnings regardless of the abnormalities in earnings.</li>
<li>As the speculative public shares vision with Wall Street it would seem logical to buy cheap stock at temporarily suppressed earnings and sell them at inflated levels created by the opposite effect.</li>
<li><em>the classical formula for “Beating the stock Market”</em>
<ul>
<li>On Wall Street, the common assumption is that trends are likely to continue or persist regardless of qualitative circumstances. While the analyst, on occasion, can place pre-dominant weight on the recent earnings, rather than the average, pursuasive evidence has to be present.</li>
<li>this strategy is not simple because the timing of the market is hard and the underlying values of stocks continuously change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>average vs trend of earnings</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>attitude of analyst where trends are upward.</em> If a qualitative study of company A is positive, which it often should be, the analyst should based future results on a conservative estimate of what the company are currently produce.</li>
<li><em>attitude of analyst where trends are downward</em>. the analyst must assign great weight to the unfavorable trend and the reasons why. However, one can’t make hasty conclusions that this trend will persist either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>deficits a qualitative, not a quantitative factor</strong>: when a company reports a deficit for the year, it is customary to calculate the amount in dollars per share or in relation to interest requirements. This is not a valid approach. Instead the attention of the analyst should be directed elsewhere.
<ul>
<li>when an average is taken over a period that includes a number of deficits, some questions must arise as to whether or not the resultant figure is really indicative of the earning power. This is especially true if the company has volatile numbers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>intuition not a part of the analyst’s stock in trade</strong>: Unless there is a reason to think otherwise, the past record is accepted as a basis for judging the future.
<ul>
<li><em>analysis of the future should be penetrating rather than prophetic</em>. In short, the investor should not be reliant on the company’s performance to improve in order to justify a premium price. Instead, the future results should be penetrating, with respect to the current capacity to earn and the price the market is trading the stock for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>large profits frequently transitory</strong>: when capital flows into new industries, it may result in overcapacity and keen competition - dragging profits down for individual company’s in the long-haul.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>rate of output and operating costs</strong>
<ul>
<li>when analyzing an individual company, each of the governing elements in the operating results must be studied for signs of unfavorable changes. Governing elements may vary, but if the analyst was assessing the general factors of a mining company, they might focus on areas like: (1) life of a mine, (2) annual output, (3) production costs and (4) selling price.</li>
<li>if the future earnings had to be supported by higher cost, it would make the current facts speculative and much riskier.</li>
<li><em>freeport sulphur company</em>
<ul>
<li>the learning point is that a high valuation based on future prospects is highly speculative. When the stock market moves away from sound sense and business experience, the common stock buyer will inevitable lose money</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>the future price of the product</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>change in status of low-cost producers</em>: when analyzing the individual company one must also look at the overall cost level, and in which direction it can be expected to change.the cost price will be a determinant for the selling price.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>anomalous prices and the price relationships in the history of the I.R.T system:</strong>
<ul>
<li>the analysis not only showed that the current selling price was far above the value of the stock. It also showed that when there is an upper limit of earnings or value being fixed, there is usually a danger that the actual figure could be less.</li>
<li>what happened afterwards for Interborough Rapid Transit System was that earnings indeed were non-recurrent and temporary. As earning power declined it ran quickly into severe financial problems.</li>

Adjustments for changes in capitalization</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>exact appraisal impossible</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>prior to the bull market of 1927-1929, a price of 10 times earnings was accepted standard for measuring common stock.</li>
<li>also, the idea of basing the valuation on current earnings is absurd since earnings are constantly changing. Stock market prices are not carefully computed, but are the result of human reactions. The stock market is the voting machine rather than a weighing machine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>limited functions of the analyst in the field stock price appraisal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>as facts and human behavior change, the security analyst must not follow a general rule for his valuations, however, Graham proposes some limited functions:
<ul>
<li>he may set-up a basis for conservative or investment valuation of common stocks, as distinguished from speculative valuations</li>
<li>he may point out the significance of: (a) the capitalization structure; and (b) the source of income, as bearing upon the valuation of a given stock issue</li>
<li>he may find unusual elements in the balance sheet which affect the implications of earnings picture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>a suggested basis of maximum appraisal for investment</strong>:
<ul>
<li>the profits of the most recent year might be accepted as an indicator of future earnings, if (1) general business conditions in that year were not exceptionally good, (2) the company has shown an upward trend of earnings for some years past and (3) the investor’s study of the industry leaves him confident about its continued growth</li>
<li>note: a P/E of 20 equates to a 5% return - assuming earnings remain constant and are treated as free cash flow to the shareholder</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>higher prices may prevail for speculative commitments</em>:</li>
<li>*other5 requisites for common stocks of investment grade and a corollary thereof: * as 20 times average earnings is the upper limit, the purchase price for ordinary businesses should be substantially less. 12 or 12.5 times average earnings can be suggested as a necessary multiplier but not a sufficient condition.
<ul>
<li>it must be emphasized that many other factors must be present, including the financial setup, not-unsatisfactory prospects and proper management.</li>
<li>An attractive common-stock investment is an attractive speculation. This is true because, if a common stock can meet the demand of a conservative investor, then he gets full value for his money, plus satisfactory future prospects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>examples of speculative and investment common stocks</strong>
<ul>
<li>stocks sold at multiple considerably more than 20 times average earnings. In other words, they all require large future growth to justify the price.</li>
<li>stocks are speculative not because of the average earnings, but the speculative element of the instability of earnings</li>
<li>stocks that passes the quantitative tests of investment quality:
<ul>
<li>earnings have been reasonably stable</li>
<li>average earnings have satisfactory ratio to market price.</li>
<li>financial setup is sufficiently conservative, and the working capital position is strong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>allowances for changes in capitalization</strong>
<ul>
<li>when dealing with past records of earnings on per-share basis, the analyst must adjust to changes in capitalization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>allowances for participating interests</strong>
<ul>
<li>when calculating earnings for the common shareholder, the participating interests must also be included. (participating interests is a new structure dividing income when it increases.)</li>
<li>similar allowances must be made for the effect of management contracts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>general rule</strong>
<ul>
<li>the intrinsic value of a common stock preceded by convertible securities cannot reasonably be appraised at a higher figure than would be justified all convertible securities were exercised in full. The same is the case if it is subject to dilution through the exercise of stock options, or through participating privileges enjoyed by other senior security</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>principle of optimum capitalization structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the optimum capitalization structure for any enterprise includes senior securities to the extent that they may be safely issued and bought for investment. the practical implication of this is that, under safe circumstances, no debt leads to an inefficient use of the shareholder’s capital. On the other hand, too much debt leaves no room for an appropriate margin of safety, as the interest coverage ratio is very small and risky</li>
<li>this safe environment may be composed both of a working capital of no less than the bond value and other conditions. Under such circumstances, a very conservative capitalization based only on the shareholders’ equity would make the shareholders’ dollars less productive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>corporate practices resulting in shortage of sound industrial bonds</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>investors generally prefer strongly funded corporation issued bonds as these offer a wider range of choices and make the sale of unsound bonds less likely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the factor of leverage is speculative capitalization structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>speculative capitalized enterprises can be sold at somewhat high prices during good markets. On the contrary, the same venture might be undervalued during a depression.</li>
<li>the real advantage, however, lies in the fact that the stock can advance more than it can decline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>speculative attractiveness of “shoestring” common stocks considered:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>practical aspects of foregoing:</em>
<ul>
<li>senior capital for the company should be held in preferred shares rather than in bonds, as this would limit the risk of bankruptcy during bad times, permitting the common stockholder to wait for better times (preferred shares can omit dividend payments, while bonds in general are obliged to pay out coupon payments)</li>

Analysis of the source of income.</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>arithmetical advantage of low-priced issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>low priced stocks offer the advantage of being more likely to appreciate than decline. Securities are found to rise more readily from 10 to 40 than from 100-400, and because of this, the speculative public would rather buy into stocks of lower numerical value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>some of the reasons most buyers of low-priced issues lose money:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>public may be buying lowed-priced stocks for the bad financial conditions.</li>
<li>high number of shares are issued, which combined are priced higher than the actual value.</li>
<li>insiders’s desire to dispose of their assets, sometimes resulting in rigorous efforts to persuade the unwary public to buy them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>low price coupled with speculative capitalization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>speculatively capitalized enterprises, according to Graham’s definition, are marked by relatively large amount of senior securities and a comparatively small issue of common stock. Although the common share in most cases is sold at a low price, this is not always the case, as long as the market value of common stock comprises only a small part of the enterprise value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>large volume and high production cost equivalent to speculative capital structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graham shows how high production costs have the same effect as coupon payments for holders of senior securities. The simple effect is that the common stockholders have fewer earnings.</li>
<li><em>general principle derived</em>. It can be derived from example that when the price of copper increases, there will be a higher profit increase percentage-wise for the high-cost producer than for the low-cost producer. This will be reflected in the share price.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>sources of income</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>special phase: analysis must be conducted for the company based on the source of income from a specific asset, and not based on the general nature of the business.
<ul>
<li><em>northern pipe line company</em>: breaking down the sources of income for this company, it can be seen that a substantial part of the income comes from stable rental and interest earnings. This type of earnings must be evaluated based on the actual value of asset producing income. Income from bonds should also be valued on a higher basis, compared to the rather volatile pipeline business showing a negative trend.</li>
<li><em>tobacco products Corporation of Virginia</em>: this company was traded as a price-earnings of 10. All income came from 99-year lease given to a high-quality company that could meet the obligation without question. This made the source of income from Tobacco Products company of Virginia equivalent to a high-grade investment bond, and on this basis the company would be deemed undervalued.</li>

Asset Value</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To gauge asset value, inspect the business’s balance sheet. A firm’s book value per share equals the total value of its tangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. Wall Street has almost entirely superseded the importance of asset value with earnings. Although rules of thumb for the proper ratio of market price to book value vary, you still should investigate the underlying value of a business’s assets before investing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current-asset value – that is, current assets minus liabilities – is perhaps a more important number. It excludes both intangible assets and fixed assets and is, therefore, a rough approximation of the value of the company should it go in to liquidation. As a general rule, if a firm’s market price is below its liquidation value, the company has either been undervalued or it should be liquidated. Investors who can distinguish between the undervalued issues and the ones performing poorly due to fundamental unsoundness can realize a significant upside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, examine the balance sheet to make sure that the company has an adequate cash position, that its current assets (exclusive of inventories) at least equal its current liabilities, and that it does not have a large amount of debt maturing soon, which could create refinancing problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there should be no discount from the amount stated on the company’s books for cash and marketable securities, provided the securities are short term or marked to the market. The same holds true for property, plant, and equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>economic value of the assets is the reproduction costs of a new firm starting out in the same industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>we first find the current market prices for the securities. Then we must adjust the book value of the firm’s accounts receivable and inventory up or down to get a more realistic reproduction costs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is important to note that goodwill represents a prior blunder that must be ignored when calculating the intrinsic value of a company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>liabilities and equity are the sources of funds that support the assets, which are the uses to which those funds are put</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are 3 types of liabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>those that arise from the normal conduct of the business</li>
<li>those that arise from past circumstances that are not pertinent to a new entrant</li>
<li>the outstanding formal debt of the company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>when we start with the reproduction cost of the assets and then subtract the first 2 categories of liabilities, we are left with the asset value of the whole enterprise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defining character of a franchise is that it enables a firm to earn more than it needs to pay for the investments that fund its assets. The intrinsic value of a firm is either the reproduction costs of the assets, which should equal the EPV or those assets plus the competitive advantages of the firm that underlie its franchise. The initial judgment that has to be made is whether the firm currently has a competitive advantage, and, if so, how strong and sustainable it is</p>

<li>the cash asset value of a stock consists of the cash assets alone, minus all liabilities and claims ahead of the issue. Cash assets, other than cash itself are defined as those directly equivalent to and held in place of cash (such as certificates of deposit, marketable securities at market value).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>practical significance of book value</strong>
<ul>
<li>the intention was to show the value of the business, but since it is far from reality, the carrying value (the number you can read from the balance sheet) has lost its significance. In most cases, the assets could not be sold at that value, and furthermore, the figure is not justified by the earnings.</li>
<li>also, the practice of writing up the book value of the fixed property, or cutting it down to nothing in order to avoid depreciation charges has made the book value have questionable application.</li>
<li>even though Graham is very skeptical about using book value, he still believes that the book value deserves at least a fleeting glance before buying or selling shares.</li>
<li>a stock buyer should not that the value of the stock is completely related to the business in question, and what he gets from his money will be in terms of tangible resources. A business that sells at a premium does so because it earns large return compared to its capital. This large return attracts competition and generally speaking, it is not likely to continue indefinitely.</li>
<li>Graham mentions that companies with high levels of intangibles might be less prone to competition, and that small companies in general are likely to show a more rapid rate of growth.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Graham examines the following ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>the current asset value is generally a rough index of liquidating value</li>
<li>a large number of common stocks sell for less than their current asset value and therefore sell below the amount realizable in liquidation</li>
<li>the phenomenon of many stocks selling persistently below their liquidating value is fundamentally illogical. It means that a serious error is being committed, either: (a) in the judgement of the stock market, (b) in the company’s management policies, or (c) in the stockholders’ attitude toward their property</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>liquidating value</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the liquidating value of an enterprise is the money the owners would receive, in theory, if they sold all assets and paid off all debt in the company. they might sell all or part of it to someone else, or they might turn the various kinds of assets into cash. Such liquidations are an everyday occurrence in the field of private business, but not for public companies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>realizable value of assets varies with their character</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>in reality, a company’s balance sheet does not provide exact information about liquidation value, but it does supply useful clues and hints. The first rule is that liabilities are real but the value of the assets must be questioned. This means that all true liabilities shown on the books must be deducted at their face amount. The value of the assets, however, must vary according to the character. Cash, for instance, is worth the carrying value, while inventory might only be worth 50-75% compared to the market price.</li>
<li><em>object of this calculation</em>: applying a general rule of thumb for a real-life company, it can ben seen that the stock was undervalued as it sold for less than the company’s cash holding - even after deducting all liabilities. <strong>The aim of using current asset value as a liquidation measure is not to find the exact liquidation number, but to establish a rough estimate.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>prevalence of stocks selling below liquidating value</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>at some time in 1932, over 40% of all industrial companies listed on NYSE were quoted at less than their net current assets. Also at that time, a considerable number actually sold for less than their cash asset value. That actually means that the owner would profit more by shutting the company down than selling equity on a going concern basis.</li>
<li>one reason for the very low valuation is the high emphasis put on the income statement. A company with no current earnings will be considered highly negative by the stock market. The seller might not know she were disposing their interest in the company below liquidation value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>local significance of this phenomenon</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>when a common stock sells persistently below its liquidating value, then either the price is too low or the company should be liquidated.</li>
<li>2 corollaries may be deducted from this principle:
<ul>
<li>although, the low price offers an attractive opportunity to buy, such price should incite the stockholders to question whether it is in their interest to continue the business</li>
<li>such a price should incite the management to take all proper steps to correct the obvious disparity between market quotation and intrinsic value, including a reconsideration of its own policies and frank justification to the stockholders of its decision to continue the business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there is a range of potential developments which may result in establishing a higher market price:
<ul>
<li>the creation of earning power that moves in lock-step with the company’s assets (for instance from a general improvement in the industry or a change in the company’s operating policies)
<ul>
<li><em>general improvement in the industry</em>: when the textile business improved the share of pepperell increased more than eightfold in just 2 years</li>
<li><em>changes in operating policies</em>: new lines of products, new sales methods, and reorganizing phases of production</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a sale or merger, because some other concern is able to utilize the resources to better advantage and hence can pay at least liquidating value for the assets.
<ul>
<li>white motor company was suffering heavy losses and was selling at a price lower than the liquidation value. The big cash holding was found interesting by an acquiring company, and the sales price was based on the current asset value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>complete or partial liquidation
<ul>
<li><em>complete liquidation</em>: investors of mohawk mining company received 2.5 times the cost of shares when it was decided to completely liquidate the company. THe liquidation value proved to be identical with the current asset value, and could be directly derived from balance sheet.</li>
<li><em>partial liquidation</em>: sometimes an effective higher market value can be created by partially liquidating parts of the business and distributing that wealth out to the shareholders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>discrimination required in selecting such issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>there is no doubt that stocks selling well below their liquidation value provides undervalued securities - and consequently profitable opportunities for purchase. Regardless, the securities analyst should exercise as much discrimination when selecting between the prospects.</li>
<li>She can lean toward the five developments above (changes in operating policies, liquidation, etc…) if it is deemed that they may occur. Also, he can look at satisfactory current earnings and dividend, or a high average earning power in the past. The analyst will avoid companies that are losing current assets at a rapid rate and showing no sign of fixing the problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>bargain of this type</strong>: common stocks that (1) are selling below their liquid asset value, (2) are apparently in no danger of dissipating these assets, and (3) have formerly shown a large earning power on the market price, may be said to belong to a class of investment bargains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>common stock representing the entire business cannot be less safe than a bond having a claim to only a part thereof</em></p>
<ul>
<li>the argument was that the company would have to pay coupon payments to the bond holders, while the dividend payments were unsecure. Here, Wall Street confuses the temporary consistency of income with the principle of safety. Dividends paid out to stockholders would not make the stock any safer. What is happening is that the stockholders turn over their own property. A rational stock owner would not surrender complete ownership for a limited claim and 5-6% returns on the investment.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>common purpose of balance sheet analysis is not to find bargain investments, but to detect financial weaknesses.</li>
<li><strong>working-capital position and debt maturities</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>basic rules concerning working capital:</strong> for the working-capital ratio, a minimum of $2 of current assets for $1 current liabilities was formerly as a standard for industrial companies.
<ul>
<li>the second measure of financial strength is the “acid test”, which requires that current assets - exclusive of inventories - should be at least equal to the current liabilities. Failing these tests would make the security speculative and higher risk.</li>
<li>Archer-Daniels-Midland company is an exception to the rule. Even though it failed the acid test, this was not a call for concern. While payables increased (lowering both the working-capital ratio and the acid ratio, as inventory increased), it represented normal seasoned practice in the industry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>large bank debt frequently a sign of weaknesses</strong>
<ul>
<li>it is rare that weak financial positions are created only by accounts payable. Weak financial positions are almost always characterized by the presence of bank loans or other debts due within a short timeframe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>the danger of early maturing funded debt</strong>: when a large bond issue is due in the near future, it can create serious financial problems, especially when operating results are unfavorable. Maturing funded debt is a frequent cause of insolvency, and can be identified from the balance sheet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>comparison of balance-sheets over a period of time</strong>
<ul>
<li>as a check-up on the reported earnings per share.</li>
<li>to determine the effect of losses (or profits) on the company’s financial position</li>
<li>to trace the relationship between the company’s resources and its earning power over a long period.</li>
<li><strong>checking the effect of losses or profit on the company’s financial position</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>taking losses on inventories may strengthen financial position</em>: some losses are represented solely by a decline in the inventory account (which might only be worth 50-75%) of the carrying value)</li>
<li>in fact, if the shrinkage in the inventory exceeds the losses, leading to an actual increase in cash or reduction in payables, it may then be proper to say that the company’s financial position has been strengthened, even though it has been suffering losses.</li>
<li>on the basis of liquidation value, the investor in Manhattan Shirt company would actually have increased the value during the depression as a result of the company turning assets into cash.</li>
<li><em>profits from inventory inflation</em>: in the event of high inflation, in terms of accounting, the inventory will increase in value.
<ul>
<li>U.S. Rubber is an example of an increase in earnings, partly made from heavy expenditures on a plant and a dangerous expansion in inventory from 1919-1920, with high inflation. The investor, only looking at the increased reported earnings, would not have found this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>long-range study of earning power and resources</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>the significance of foregoing figures</em>
<ul>
<li>for United states steel corporation, the effect of WWI is very clear, and has added a big sum to the earnings. The rate of earnings of hte investing capital has, however, declined in the last decade.</li>
<li>this raises the question of whether the end of the war turned the industry into a relatively unprofitable business, from a previously relatively prosperous one. It also raise the question whether it as due to the high reinvestment, which led to overcapacity and consequently lower return.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>in the past, a stock-option warrant was something that was attached to a bond or a preferred stock, and carried privileges. It was not seen as an independent instrument and as an important part of the capitalization. Today, opinions are reversed, and it has even turned into a popular medium for speculators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a (detachable) option warrant is a transferable right to buy stock. The right can be described in detail by the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) the kind of stock, (2) the amount, (3) the price, (4) the method of payment, (5) the duration of the privilege, and (6) anti dilution provisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>type of stock covered by the privilege. Nearly all option warrants can be converted to common stock for the issuing company. Very few have rights that apply to preferred shares. Warrents have no right to receive interest, dividends or payments on account of principal, nor do they have the right to cash any vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>resemblance to subscription “right”</strong>: warrants are in many ways similar to the subscription rights issued by the corporation to stockholders in connection with the sale of additional stock. Differences occur, however, in terms of the exercised price and the time period. Subscription rights will typically always be exercised unless the stock price drops substantially, and it will generally happen within the 60 days that the rights typically run. Warrants, on the other hand, are seldom exercised in such a short period of time, as the stock purchase price is typically set higher than the current stock price at the time of issue. The duration is most often longer than a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>method of payment</strong>. Most option warrants require payment of subscription price in cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>basis of trading in warrants</strong>: option warrants are bought and sold in the market in the same way as common stocks. The standard rule of a warrant is the right to buy one share of the stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>examples of warrants issued for various purposes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>attached to senior securities</li>
<li>as compensation to underwriters.</li>
<li>as compensation to promoters and management</li>
<li>issued in a merger or reorganization plan, in exchange for other securities</li>
<li>attached to an original issue of common stock</li>
<li>sold separately for cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>warrants as a vehicle of speculation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>qualitative element</em>: since the value of a warrant will only materialize from an increase in earnings, the prospects of increased earnings would make the warrant more attractive than its stability, characterized as low-priced common stocks with speculative element.</li>
<li><em>quantitative considerations: importance of low price</em>
<ul>
<li>Graham feels that an option warrant has speculative attractiveness only if it possesses all 3 desirable qualities: low price, long duration, and option price close to the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>substantial part of an enterprise’s profits are distributed to operating managers, and that this is done without full disclosure. Stock option warrants have proven to be an excellent instrument for that purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>dangerous device for diluting stock values.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>as warrants give rights to buy stock at a given price level, when that pirce level is reached, earnings will be diluted for the common stockholder because they still must account for the cost to acquire the warrant</li>
<li>the original issue of common stock carrying warrants to buy additional stock does not give stockholders anything more than they would have without the warrant. Further, it violates an obvious rule of sound corporate financing. A properly managed business sells additional stock only when new capital is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>cost of management: 3 items</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>buyers of stock at $34 per share were asked to pay for the management in 3 ways:
<ul>
<li>the $3 difference between the price the investor paid and the price the company paid. While this money would go to the investment banker as an underwriter’s fee, in reality that premium is paid in the belief that the management was worth the difference.</li>
<li>The issue of the warrants had in effect taken value away from the common stockholder, of one-third of the appreciation.</li>
<li>the salaries the officers were to receive plus additional taxes.</li>
<li>the 3 items together may be said to absorb between 25 and 30% of the amount contributed by the public.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>pyramiding in corporate finance is the creation of a speculative capital structure by means of a holding company or a series of holding companies. By such a construction, the organizers can control a large business with only little or no capital. Often the intention is to “cash in” speculative profits, and at the same time retain control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>evils of corporate pyramiding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it results in the creation and sale to investors of large amounts of unsound senior securities</li>
<li>the common stock of the governing holding companies is subject to deceptively rapid increases in earning power during favorable years, which can lead to disastrous public speculation.</li>
<li>the position of control of someone who owns only little or no capital is bound to lead to irresponsible and unsound management</li>
<li>it allows for deceiving accounting techniques in terms of indicated earnings, dividend return, and book value. This will again lead to speculation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>overstatement of earnings:</em> holding companies can overstate their earnings power by valuing, at an artificially high prices, the stock dividends they receive from subsidiaries. Earning power can also be overstated using profits made from the sale of stock of subsidiary companies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>distortion of dividend return</em>: stock dividends can be paid out with a market value exceeding current earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>exaggeration of book value</em>. The exaggeration of book value may occur in cases where a holding company owns most of the shares of subsidiary consequently making it possible to manipulate the small amount of stock remaining in the market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>some holding companies not guilty of excessive pyramiding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>legitimate reasons for their creation include: to permit unified and economical operations of separate units, to diversify investment and risk, and to gain certain technical advantages of flexibility and convenience. Any holding company should always be considered on its merits.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>general procedure of the analyst</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>first method is to conduct a series of comparative analyses of industrial groups along the lines described in the previous chapter. Such studies will give a fair idea of the standard of usual characteristics of that industry.</li>
<li>the second general method consists of scrutinizing corporate reports. A quick glance over hundreds of such reports may reveal between five and 10 that look interesting enough from the earnings or current asset standpoint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>can cyclical swings of prices be exploited</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>one can setup criteria to give an objective opinion of the price level of the stock market, then trade accordingly. While Graham argues the practicality of such a procedure is low, and under the Great Depression would have made heavy demands upon human fortitude, he still finds the idea appealing. The reason is by looking into such a procedure, one is more likely to buy at attractive intrinsic value levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>opportunities in “secondary” or little-known issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>the impermanence of leadership</em>: the composition of the market leader group varies greatly from year to year, especially in view of the recent shift of attention from past performance to assumed prospects.</li>
<li><em>opportunities in normal markets</em> during a period when the market in general shows no definite signs of being too low or too high, stocks can still be found cheap on a statistical basis. These stocks generally fall into 2 classes:
<ul>
<li>those showing high current and average earnings in relation to market price</li>
<li>those making a reasonably satisfactory exhibit of earnings and selling at a low price in relation to net-current asset value. These companies will most often not be large and well known.</li>
<li>the main drawback of a small company is its vulnerability for loss of earning power. Larger companies will be less prone to this. The counter argument is that successful smaller companies can multiply in size more impressively than those already on enormous size.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>market behavior of standard and nonstandard issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>standard or leading issues almost always respond rapidly to changes in their reported profits - they tend to exaggerate the significance of year-to-year fluctuations in earnings</li>
<li>the action of less familiar issues depends largely upon the attitude of the professional market operators towards them. If there is interest in the issue, legitimate as well as speculative, the price will respond in an extreme fashion.</li>
<li><em>relationship of the analyst to such situations</em> when the general market appears dangerously overvalued to the analyst, he must exercise caution when it comes to unfamiliar common stocks. The same applies when stocks appear to be bargains. A severe decline in the general market will affect all stock prices adversely, and the less familiar issues may prove especially vulnerable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>market exaggerations ue to factors other than changes in earnings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>dividend changes</em> while there is no doubt that a dividend increase is a favorable development, a large increase in stock prices based solely on this is absurd.</li>
<li><em>mergers and segregations</em>: studies into whether mergers and acquisitions aid in increasing earning power have in general indicated that no such effect can be found. Instead, there is reason to believe that the personal element in corporate management often stands in the way of advantageous consolidations. In light of this fact, it is surprising that the stock market tends to react so positively to mergers and acquisitions in the short run.</li>
<li><em>litigation:</em> a lawsuit of any significance is highly disliked by the stock market, often to an extent that is out of proportion to the impact of the case in question. Developments of this kind may offer real opportunities to the analyst</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>price-value discrepancies in receivership</strong>: Graham argues that the analyst can invest in securities after such difficulties have arisen, because senior securities have been found to sell at too low prices. Cases of reorganization, and other situations where liquidation or sale to outside interest, ultimately result in a cash distributions that can produce attractive analytical opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>price patterns produced by insolvency</strong> certain price patterns tend to occur, especially if the receivership tends to take a long time. First, there is a tendency for the stock issue to sell too high, not only toward the bond issue, but also to their estimated value. For bond issues, the price typically declines over time, reaching the lowest point just before a reorganization plan is ready to be announced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>opportunities in railroad trusteeships</strong>: in the years following 1932 and the following year, a large part of the country’s railroad mileage fell into the hands of the trustee. This provided the shrewd investors with interesting opportunities as it put pressure on the price levels of securities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>vulnerability of unseasoned issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if the earnings power is maintained, the unseasoned issue would also maintain the price, but even slight dissatisfactory development will lead to severe price decline.</li>
<li><em>unseasoned industrial issues rarely deserve an investment rating</em>: unseasoned industrial issues should only be bought on an admittedly speculative basis. This requires in turn that the market price be low enough to permit a substantial rise, typically below 70.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>discrepancies in comparative prices</strong>: it is easier to determine whether issue A is better than issue B, than to determine whether issue A in its own right is a good investment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graham gives 2 recommendations for selecting an issue to purchase (1) the issue to be bought is attractive in its own right or (2) there is a definite contractual relationship between the 2 issues in question</li>
<li>for the first recommendation, a qualitative analysis must also be carried out, to evaluate the future earning power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>discrepancies due to special supply and demand factors</strong> this can be due to special and temporary factors. As an example, Graham mentiosn a high-grade railroad issue that became priced relatively differently due to a heavy volume sale of another series</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>united states savings bonds offer similar opportunity</strong> the disparity between US Government and corporate obligations has reappeared in recent years. In addition to their safety factor, there are also tax advantages, as well as the opportunity to liquidate in the market any any time, with no intermediate loss in the market, due to the spread.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>one fact that the analyst should be aware of when conducting his analysis is whether or not he is looking at a homogenous industry. Homogenous companies respond similarly to a change in business conditions. In this case, an industry comparison is considered more dependable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it should be remembered, however, that a preferred stock is always less attractive, logically considered, than a common stock making the same showing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>most recent numbers would require more attention, and secondly, teh analyst should aim to learn as much as possible about the underlying reasons for the difference in performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a general rule, the less homogeneous the industry, the more attention needs to be paid to the qualitative factors when making comparisons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the analyst must consider qualitative factors and perhaps also allow for the lack of homogeneity. The technique of comparative analysis may facilitate his task, but he must still expect to be wrong from time to time. Still, with intelligence and prudence, he should yield better results than the guesses of typical stock buyer.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2 kinds of market analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>first kind of market analysis makes predictions exclusively from the past actions of the stock market. (the market is its own best forecaster)
<ul>
<li><em>implication of the first type of market analysis</em>
<ul>
<li>often called technical analysis.</li>
<li>chart-reading cannot be a science</li>
<li>it has not proved itself in the past to be a dependable method of making profits in the stock market.</li>
<li>its theoretical basis rests upon faulty logic or else upon mere assertion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the other type of machanical forecasting is based on factors outside the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>disadvantages of market analysis as compared with security analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>in market analysis there are no margins of safety; you are either right or wrong, and if you are wrong, you lose money.</li>
<li>another disadvantage is that profits made by trading in the market are for the most part realized at the expense of others who are trying to do the same thing. The market analyst can therefore be hopeful of success only upon the assumption that he will be more clever or perhaps luckier than his competitors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>phophesies based on near-term prospects.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the argument is that if the outlook favors increased earnings, the issue should be bought in the expectation that it will increase in price when the actual profit reported.</li>
<li>Graham is skeptical of ability of the analyst to forecast the market behavior of individual issues over the near-term future. This does not matter if he bases his predictions on the technical position of the market, the general outlook for business, or the specific outlook for the individual companies.</li>
<li>more satisfactory results are to be obtained  by confining the positive conclusions of the security analyst to these fields:
<ul>
<li>the selection of standard senior issues that meet exacting safety tests.</li>
<li>the discovery of senior issues that merit an investment rating, but also have opportunities for appreciation in value.</li>
<li>the discovery of common stocks or speculative senior issues that appear to be selling at far less than their intrinsic value.</li>
<li>the determination of definite price discrepancies between related securities for which situations may justify making exchanges or initiating hedging or arbitrage operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>summary of our views on investment policies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>investor of small means</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><em>investment for income</em>
<ul>
<li>in 1940, United States Savings Bonds have safety and accumulated income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>investment for profit</em>
<ul>
<li>4 approaches are open to both the small and large investor
<ul>
<li>purchase of representative common stocks when the market level is clearly low, as judged by objective, long-term standards. This policy requires patience and courage, and is by no means free from the possibility of grave miscalculation</li>
<li>purchase of individual issues with special growth possibilities, when these can be obtained at reasonable prices in relation to actual accomplishment. The investor must remember that, when growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable.</li>
<li>purchase of well-secured privileged senior issues. A combination of adequate security with a promising conversion or similar right is a rare, but possible. A policy of careful selection in this field should bring good results, provided the investor has the patience and persistence needed to find her opportunities.</li>
<li>purchase of securities welling well below intrinsic value. Intrinsic value takes into account not only past earnings and liquid asset values, but also future earning power, conservatively estimated. In other words, qualitative as well as quantitative elements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there is logic in the belief that unless a man is qualified to advise others professionally, he should not prescribe for himself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>speculation</em>
<ul>
<li>buying stock in new or virtually new ventures. The odds are so strongly against him that he might as well throw three-quarters of the money out of the window and keep the rest in the bank.</li>
<li>trading in the market: Graham believes that, regardless of preparation and method, success in trading is accidental and temporary, or else due to a highly uncommon talent.</li>
<li>purchase of “growth stocks” at generous prices. the chances of individual success are much brighter here than in the other forms of speculation. That said, as it is considered speculation, this approach is still inherently dangerous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>the individual investor of large means</strong>
<ul>
<li>although he has obvious technical advantages over the small investor, he suffers from three specific handicaps
<ul>
<li>the investor must not only consider United States Savings Bonds, but also the broader field of fixed-value investment. We believe that strict application of quantitative tests, plus reasonably good judgement in the qualitative area should yield a satisfactory end result.</li>
<li>possible inflation is more serious to him than to the small investor. As stocks to some extend are inflation proof, they can ben held as a defensive measure.</li>
<li>the size of her investment unit is more likely to induce the large investor to concentrate on popular and active issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>investment by business corporations</strong>
<ul>
<li>it seems fairly evident that other types of investments by business enterprises, be they in bonds or stocks, can offer an appreciably higher return only at the risk of loss and criticism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>institutional investment</strong>
<ul>
<li>an institution that can manage to get along on the low income provided by high-grade, fixed value issues should confine its holdings to this field. It can be doubted if the better performance of common stock indexes over the past periods will, in itself, warrant the heavy responsibilities and the recurring uncertainties that are inseparable from a common-stock investment program.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The interests of shareholders and those of management do not always coincide. Most shareholders defer to the wisdom of management without demanding their rights as owners of the business. In the case of companies whose common stocks sell for less than the liquidating value, the shareholders may be best served by the liquidation of the company, but that would put management out of a job, so shareholders cannot depend on management to make the right decision. Investors need to educate themselves about management practices and take these lessons into account when making investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember, however, that “analysis connotes the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic. It is part of the scientific method. But in applying analysis to the field of securities, [you will] encounter the serious obstacle that investment is by nature not an exact science.” Still, professional analysis is “not only useful, but indispensable.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is the stockholders who own the company; the officers are only paid employees. The directors are elected and virtually trustees, whose legal duty is to act solely on behalf of the business owners.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>interests of stockholders and officers conflict at certain points</strong>:
<ul>
<li>in some situations, the management may explicitly have interests in conflict with those of the shareholders
<ul>
<li>compensation to officers - salaries, bonuses, options to buy stock</li>
<li>expansion of the business - involving the right to larger salaries and the acquisition of more power and prestige by the officers</li>
<li>payment of dividends - should the money earned remain under the  control of the management or pass into the hands of the stockholders?</li>
<li>continuance of the stockholders’ investment in the company - should the business continue as before, although unprofitable, or should part of the capital be withdrawn, or should the business be would up completely.</li>
<li>information to stockholders - should those in control be able to benefit through having information not generally given to stockholders?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>wisdom of continuing the business should be considered</strong>
<ul>
<li>management, by definition, is reluctant to return capital to investors, even though the capital might be more useful there. The reason is resource scarcity. For example, to pay the bills when company has financial problems later.</li>
<li>whether or not the business should continue is a decision for stockholders, not management. A logical reason to consider is when the market price is below the liquidation level. After all, that means that the market is wrong, or that the management is wrong in keeping the enterprise alive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>various possible moves for correcting market prices for shares:</strong>
<ul>
<li>if directors are convinced that continuation is preferable to liquidation, the reasons leading to this conclusion should be supplied. One solution to maintain the business and limit the risk for investors is a new dividend policy. The rate should be at least equivalent to the liquidation value to ensure that stockholders do not to suffer as a result of this decision to keep the business alive. A third option could be to distribute excess cash back to stockholders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>liquidation of an unprofitable business with substantial assets is almost certain to realize more than the existing market price. The reason is that market prices are governed by earnings; the liquidation process is based on assets.</li>
<li><em>repurchase of share pro rata from shareholders:</em> if capital is no longer required, it can be advantageous to distribute it back through share buyback.</li>

<ul>
<li>failure to distinguish one from another has led to tragedies.</li>
<li>investments are bonds, outright purchases, permanent holding, for income, in safe securities.</li>
<li>speculations are stocks, purchases on margin, for a “quick turn”, for profit, in risky issues.</li>
<li>specific standards have to be applied to give meaning to the term “safety”</li>
<li>an investment operation promises the safety of the principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.</li>
<li>an investment operation is one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.</li>
<li>investment is founded on the past and present, speculation relies on the future to improve.</li>
<li>for the investor, the future is to be guarded against rather than profit from.</li>
<li>for the speculator, he anticipates the future will be better than the past.</li>
<li>“intelligent speculation” is taking a measured risk that seems justified after analysis</li>
<li>“unintelligent speculation” is taking a risk without adequate examination of the situation</li>
<li>safety is measured in terms of the ability of the issuer to meet obligations
<ul>
<li>that ability should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>lack of safety is not compensated by high dividends</li>
<li>Avoiding trouble is better than seeking protection after it occurs.</li>
<li>a sound investment must be able to withstand adversity. Enterprises that have withstood adversity may be favored by investors.</li>
<li>investment for profit, where growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable.</li>
<li>the investor of small means may opt to step out of his role and become a speculator. He may also opt to regret his actions.</li>

<p>“There is very little altruism in finance.”</p>
<p>“The typical American stockholder is the most docile and apathetic animal in captivity. He never thinks of asserting his individual rights as owner of the business.”</p>
<p>“Modern financing methods are not that far different from a magician’s bag of tricks; they can be executed in full view of the public without it being very much the wiser.”</p>
<p>“You cannot make a quantitative deduction to allow for an unscrupulous management; the only way to deal with such situations is to avoid them.”</p>
<p>“Undervalued investment issues may be discovered in any period by means of assiduous search.”</p>
<p>“The investor cannot safely judge the merits or demerits of a security by his personal reaction to the kind of business in which it is engaged.”</p>
<p>“An institution with securities of its own to sell cannot be looked to for entirely impartial guidance.”</p>
<p>“Needless to say, an investor is never forced to buy a security of inferior grade.”</p>
<p>“An investment in the soundest type of enterprise may be made on unsound and unfavorable terms.”</p>
<p>“Safety does not reside in titles, or forms, or legal rights, but in the values behind the security issue.”</p>
<p>“The fact that no good bonds are available is hardly an excuse for either issuing or accepting poor ones.”</p>
<p>“Whatever benefits a business benefits its owners, provided the benefit is not conferred upon the corporation at the expense of the stockholders.”</p>
<p>“Very frequently, the market’s appraisals are based on mob psychology, on faulty reasoning and on the most superficial examination of inadequate information.”</p>

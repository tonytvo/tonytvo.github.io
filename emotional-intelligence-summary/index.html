<ul>
<li>Own it, Face it, Feel it, Ask it, Drive it</li>
<li>sometimes, our subconscious mind causes us to try and validate our emotional responses consciously. For example, if you’re not feeling great, you might look for ways that the day is bad or getting worse.</li>
<li>the power of pause: pausing after someone’s answered a question or said something (for dramatic effect) to encourage them to draw upon their subconscious mind and bring deeper thoughts/feelings to the conversation.</li>
<li>Identify our own beliefs and values</li>
<li>“Our minds are what created fear, and our mind is the only thing that can smash through it.”</li>
<li>Ask yourself: ‘Do I want to change this? Why do I want to change this? What stands to happen if I don’t change this?’</li>
<li>accepting that something is going to happen and that the only thing we can control is how we choose to respond is where EI comes in.</li>

<li>I’m either good at something or I’m not -> <strong>I can improve my skills with effort and practice</strong></li>
<li>when people give me feedback, it feels like criticism -> <strong>I appreciate it; it helps me learn and grow</strong></li>
<li>I’m just not good at math -> <strong>Math is challenging for me, but I know I can improve</strong></li>
<li>I’m too shy to speak in front of the class -> <strong>With practice, I can become more confident and improve my public speaking skills</strong></li>
<li>I’m already a really good writer. I don’t need to get any better -> <strong>There’s always room for improvement</strong></li>
<li>naturally smart people don’t need to try hard to succeed -> <strong>No one is born smart. We can all improve with time, effort and persistence</strong></li>
<li>Other people’s successes make me feel bad about myself -> <strong>Other people’s successes encourage and inspire me. They show me what is possible</strong></li>
<li>Successful people are lucky/talented and have never experienced failure -> <strong>Failure is part of success. Most successful people have failed many times, but they succeeded because they didn’t quit</strong></li>
<li>I wish I was as good at baseball as you. It’s not fair -> <strong>Your skills as a baseball player inspire me. Do you have any tips to help me improve</strong></li>
<li>It’s embarrassing when I make a mistake -> <strong>everyone makes mistakes, and mistakes are opportunities to learn</strong></li>
<li>If I don’t try new or hard things, then I won’t fail -> <strong>I have to try new and difficult things in order to grow, even if I fail at first</strong></li>
<li>When I fail, I get frustrated and give up -> <strong>When I fail or get frustrated, I try again using the lessons I’ve learned.</strong></li>
<li>Failure means it is time to give up -> <strong>I only truly fail when I stop trying</strong></li>
<li>I can’t do that -> <strong>I can’t do that yet. I’m going to keep going, try new strategies, and/or ask for help until I understand it</strong></li>
<li>If I don’t improve right away, I get frustrated. I start to criticize myself -> <strong>I know improvement takes time, and I celebrate the small steps. Even a little progress makes a difference</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Let’s explore some of the most common types of cognitive biases that entrench themselves in our lives. Awareness is the best way to beat these biases, so pay careful attention to how they influence you. Don’t allow them to hinder your emotional intelligence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confirmation bias.</strong> Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek out information that supports our pre-existing beliefs. In other words, we form an opinion first and then seek out evidence to back it up, rather than basing our opinions on facts. Social media apps have been accused of using this bias to keep us engaged by loading our feeds with what we already believe, rather than challenging us with new information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fundamental attribution error.</strong> This is the tendency to attribute situational behavior to a person’s fixed personality. For example, people often attribute another person’s poor work performance to laziness when there are so many other possible explanations. It could be that the individual in question is receiving projects they aren’t passionate about, their rocky home life is carrying over to their work life, or they’re burned out. When you’re the one being lazy, you don’t assume it’s a character flaw. You attribute this to the situation you’re in. That’s how the fundamental attribution error works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The decoy effect.</strong> This occurs when someone believes they have two options, but you present a third option to make the second one feel</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>more palatable. For example, you visit a car lot to consider two cars, one listed for $30,000 and one for $40,000. At first, the $40,000 car seems expensive, so the salesman shows you a $65,000 car. Suddenly, the $40,000 car seems reasonable by comparison. This salesman is preying on your decoy bias the decoy being the $65,000 car that he knows you won’t buy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The ideometer effect.</strong> This refers to the fact that our thoughts can make us feel real emotions. This is why actors envision terrible scenarios, such as the death of a loved one, in order to make themselves cry on cue. It’s also why activities such as cataloging what you’re grateful for can have such a profound, positive impact on your well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The halo effect.</strong> The halo effect occurs when someone creates a strong first impression and that impression sticks. This is extremely noticeable in grading. For example, often a teacher grades a student’s first paper, and if it’s good, the teacher is prone to continue giving the student high marks for future papers even if their performance doesn’t warrant it. The same thing happens at work and in personal relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The horn effect.</strong> This effect is the exact opposite of the halo effect. When you perform poorly at first, you can easily get pegged as a low performer, even if you work hard enough to disprove that notion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conservatism bias.</strong> This bias leads people to believe that pre-existing information takes precedence over new information. Don’t be quick to reject something just because it’s radical or different. Great ideas usually are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Affect heuristic.</strong> Affect heuristic is the human tendency to base our decisions on our emotions. For example, consider a study conducted at Shukutoku University, Japan. Participants judged a disease that killed 1,286 people out of every 10,000 as being more dangerous than one that was 24.14% fatal (despite this representing twice as many deaths). People reacted emotionally to the image of 1,286 people dying, whereas the percentage didn’t arouse the same mental imagery and emotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The ostrich effect.</strong> The ostrich effect is aptly named after the mistaken belief that ostriches, when scared, literally bury their heads in the ground. This effect describes our tendency to hide from impending problems. We may not physically bury our heads in the ground, but we might as well. For example, if your company is experiencing layoffs or you’re having relationship issues, it’s common to attempt to push all these problems away, rather than face them head on. This never works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reactance.</strong> Reactance is our tendency to react to rules and regulations by exercising our freedom. A prevalent example of this is children with over-bearing parents. Tell a teenager to do what you say because you told them so, and they’re very likely to start breaking your rules. Similarly, employees who feel mistreated or “Big Brothered” by their employers are more likely to take longer breaks, use extra sick days, or even steal from their company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning fallacy.</strong> Planning fallacy is the tendency to think that we can do things more quickly than we actually can. For procrastinators, this leads to incomplete work, and this makes Type As overpromise and underdeliver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The bandwagon effect.</strong> The bandwagon effect is the tendency to do what everyone else is doing. This creates a kind of groupthink, where people run with the first idea that’s put onto the table instead of exploring a variety of options. The bandwagon effect illustrates how we like to make decisions based on what feels good (doing what everyone else is doing), even when it’s a poor alternative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bias blind spot.</strong> If you begin to feel that you’ve mastered your biases, keep in mind that you’re most likely experiencing the bias blind spot. This is the tendency to see biases in other people but not in yourself.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The compensation effect.</strong> The compensation effect refers to people’s tendency to assume that they accumulate moral capital. We use good deeds to balance out bad deeds, or alternately, we give ourselves breaks from goodness, like a piece of chocolate cake after a week of salads. This makes people more inclined to do bad things under the guise of “I’m a good person” or “It’s just this one thing.” A great example of this is a study in which people were observed lying and cheating more after they made the decision to purchase products that were good for the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cognitive dissonance.</strong> Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort humans feel when they hold two contradictory opinions or when their behavior is inconsistent with their beliefs. It’s one of the strongest psychological forces driving human behavior. When people who feel they are good do bad things, cognitive dissonance makes them ignore this behavior because they can’t tolerate the inconsistency between their behavior and their beliefs. This only leads to more bad behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The power of names.</strong> What you name something is important, because it can skew people’s sense of reality. If companies assign unethical practices simple and humorous euphemisms (like “financial engineering” for accounting fraud), employees are less likely to take their unethical behavior seriously. Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, was famous for saying, “Doing business is a game, the greatest game in the world if you know how to play it.” Something as simple as calling business a game can make people less likely to see that their actions have serious real-world consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Obedience to authority.</strong> It’s quite difficult for most people to ignore the wishes of those in positions of authority. People also feel that they’re less responsible for wrongdoings if they act under the direction of someone else. Both reasons explain why employees are likely to act out the unethical wishes of their supervisors and feel far less guilt than if they had decided to do it themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Pygmalion effect.</strong> The Pygmalion effect refers to people’s tendency to act the way that other people treat them. For example, if employees are treated like they’re upright members of a team, they’re more likely to act accordingly. Alternately, if they’re treated with</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>!!! suspicion, they’re more likely to act in a way that justifies that perception.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The pressure to conform.</strong> The pressure to conform is powerful. When a group engages in unethical behavior, individuals are far more likely to participate in or condone that behavior rather than risk standing out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conspicuous consumption.</strong> When companies splash money around, they contribute to unethical behavior. Flashy displays of wealth lead to increased selfishness. Employees either aim hard for these carrots or develop jealousy of their high-rolling colleagues who achieve them. This leads to people who are more likely to put their own needs ahead of doing the right thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The blinding effect of power.</strong> People in power typically see themselves as inherently different from their employees. This can lead them to set ethical boundaries for their employees that are more stringent than the ones they set for themselves. What happens next is the stuff of newspaper headlines.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Appreciate what you have</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Research conducted at the University of California, Davis, showed that people who worked daily to cultivate an attitude of gratitude experienced improved mood, energy, and physical well-being. It’s likely that lower levels of cortisol played a major role in this improvement. The Davis study participants had one simple task: Pause during the day to contemplate what they were grateful for. Lowering your cortisol is that easy.</li>
<li>3 habits in the first 5 mins of the day (one of them is to write down what you’re grateful for)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay positive.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. In these moments, think about your day, and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small. If you can’t think of something from the current day, reflect on the previous day or even the previous week. Or perhaps you’re looking forward to an exciting event that you can focus on. The point here is that you must have something positive that you’re ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative. Research from University College London found that negative thinkers have a significantly greater chance of developing dementia over just a four-year period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid asking, “What if?”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“What if?” statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you’ll spend focusing on taking action that will calm you down and keep your stress under control. Calm people know that asking “What if?” will only take them to a place they don’t want or need to go. If you do find yourself having trouble letting go of a particular “What if?,” take a moment to consider your plan of action should it come to fruition and move on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disconnect.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Given the importance of keeping stress intermittent, it’s easy to see how taking regular time off the grid can help keep your stress under control. When you make yourself available to your work 24/7, you expose yourself to a constant barrage of stressors. Forcing yourself offline and even-gulp!-turning off your phone gives your body a break from a constant source of stress. Studies have shown that something as simple as an email break can lower stress levels.</li>
<li>putting a mental recharge into your weekly schedule. If you’re worried about the negative repercussions of taking this step, first try doing it at times when you’re unlikely to be contacted-maybe Sunday morning. As you grow more comfortable with these breaks, and as your coworkers begin to accept that you spend time offline, gradually expand the amount of time you spend away from technology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limit your caffeine intake.</strong> Drinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the “fight-or-flight” response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt email. When caffeine puts your brain and body into this hyper-aroused state of stress, your emotions outrun your behavior. The stress that caffeine creates is far from intermittent, as its long half-life ensures that it takes its sweet time working its way out of your body.</p>

<p><strong>Sleep.</strong> I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep for increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. Stressful projects often make you feel as if you have no time to sleep, but taking the time to get a decent night’s sleep is often the one thing keeping you from getting things under control. Many of us don’t know what appropriate sleep hygiene is or why we have such lousy sleep. The chapter on cleaning up your sleep hygiene will help</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>you make your sleep top notch. Reframe your perspective. Stress and worry are fueled by our own skewed perceptions of events. It’s easy to think that unrealistic deadlines, unforgiving bosses, and out-of-control traffic are the reasons you’re so stressed all the time. You can’t control your circumstances, but you can control how you respond to them. <strong>So, before you spend too much time dwelling on something, take a minute to put the situation into perspective.</strong>. If you’re thinking in broad, sweeping statements such as “Everything is going wrong” or “Nothing will work out,” then you need to reframe the situation. A great way to correct this unproductive thought pattern is to list specific things that are actually going wrong or not working out. Most likely, you will come up with only a few things (not everything), and the scope of these stressors will look much more limited than they initially appeared.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Breathe.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Practicing being in the moment with your breathing will train your brain to focus on the task at hand and get the stress monkey off your back. When you’re feeling stressed, take a couple of minutes to focus on your breathing. Close the door, put away all other distractions, and just sit in your chair and breathe. Your goal is to spend the entire time focused on your breathing, which will prevent your mind from wandering. Think about how it feels to breathe in and out. This sounds simple, but it’s hard to do it for more than a minute or two. It’s all right if you get sidetracked by another thought. This will happen at the beginning, and you just need to bring your focus back to your breathing. If you struggle to stay focused on your breathing, try counting each breath in and out until you get to 20, and then start again from 1. Don’t worry if you lose count. You can always just start over.</li>
<li>Shallow breaths deprive your brain of oxygen. This leads to poor concentration, forgetfulness, mood swings, anxiety and lack of energy. Breathe slowly and deeply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Say no.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Research conducted at the University of California, Berkeley, showed that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you will experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Saying no is indeed a major challenge for many people. “No” is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it’s time to say no, avoid phrases such as “I don’t think I can” or “I’m not certain.” Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neutralize toxic people.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with difficult people is frustrating, exhausting, and highly stressful. You can control your interactions with toxic people by keeping your feelings in check. When you need to confront a toxic person, approach the situation rationally. Identify your emotions, and don’t allow anger or frustration to add to the chaos. In addition, consider the difficult person’s viewpoint and perspective so that you can find solutions and common ground. When things completely derail, take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting them bring you down. This is easier said than done, which is why there’s a separate chapter on techniques and habits for neutralizing toxic people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t hold grudges.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The negative emotions that come with holding onto a grudge are actually a stress response. Just thinking about the event sends your body into fight-or-flight mode. When the threat is imminent, this reaction is essential to your survival, but when the threat is ancient history, holding onto that stress wreaks havoc on your body and can have devastating health consequences over time. In fact, researchers at Emory University have shown that holding onto stress contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease. Holding onto a grudge means you’re holding onto stress, and emotionally intelligent people know to avoid this at all costs. Letting go of a grudge not only makes you feel better now but can also improve your health.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice mindfulness.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mindfulness is a simple, research-supported form of meditation that helps you gain control of unruly thoughts and behaviors. People who practice mindfulness regularly are more focused, even when they are not meditating. It is an excellent technique to help reduce stress, because it helps you reduce the feeling of not being in control. Essentially, mindfulness helps you stop jumping from one thought to the next, which keeps you from ruminating on negative thoughts. Overall, it’s a great way to make it through your busy day calmly and productively. There’s a separate chapter on how to practice this technique.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A Stanford study found that productivity per hour declines sharply when a workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that there’s no point in working any more. That’s right. People who work as much as 70 hours (or more) per week actually get the same amount done as people who work 55 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule 1: Minimize chores.</strong> Chores tend to monopolize your free time. When this happens, you lose the opportunity to relax and reflect. What’s worse, doing a lot of chores feels like work, and if you spend all weekend doing them, you just put in a seven-day workweek. To keep this from happening, you need to schedule your chores like you would anything else during the week. If you don’t complete them during the allotted time, you move on and finish them the following weekend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule 2: Exercise.</strong> No time to exercise during the week? You have 48 hours every weekend to make it happen. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a soothing neurotransmitter that reduces stress. Exercise is also a great way to come up with new ideas. Innovators and other successful people know that being outdoors often sparks creativity. I know that a lot of my best ideas come to me while I’m surfing. While you’re out in the ocean, the combination of invigorating activity and beautiful scenery creates the perfect environment to be creative. Whether you’re running, cycling, or gardening, exercise leads to endorphin-fueled introspection. The key is to find a physical activity that does this for you and then to make it an important part of your weekly routine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule 3: Pursue a passion.</strong> You might be surprised what happens when you pursue something you’re passionate about during your time off. Indulging your passions is a great way to escape stress and open your mind to new ways of thinking. Things like playing music, reading, writing, painting, or even playing catch with your kids can help stimulate different modes of thought that can reap huge dividends over the coming week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule 4: Spend quality time with your family.</strong> Spending quality time with your family is essential if you want to recharge and relax. Weekdays are so hectic that the entire week can fly by with little quality family time. Don’t let this bleed into your weekends. Take your kids to the park, take your spouse to their favorite restaurant, and go visit your parents. You’ll be glad you did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule 5: Schedule micro-adventures.</strong> Buy tickets to a concert or play, or make reservations for that cool new hotel that just opened downtown. Instead of running on a treadmill, plan a hike. Try something you haven’t done before, or perhaps something you haven’t done in a long time. Studies have shown that anticipating something good is a significant part of what makes the activity pleasurable. Knowing that you have something interesting planned for Saturday will not only be fun come Saturday but will also significantly improve your mood throughout the week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule 6: Designate mornings as me time.</strong> Your mind achieves peak performance two to four hours after you wake up, so get up early to do something physical and invigorating, and then save the mental tasks for later in the morning when your mind is at its peak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule 7: Prepare for the upcoming week.</strong> The weekend is a great time to spend a few moments planning your upcoming week. As little as 30 minutes of planning can yield significant gains in productivity and reduced stress. The week feels a lot more manageable when you go into it with a plan, because all you have to focus on is execution. Weekly reflection is a powerful tool for improvement. Use the weekend to contemplate the larger forces that are shaping your industry, your organization, and your job. Without the distractions of Monday to Friday busy work, you should be able to see things in a whole new light. Use this insight to alter your approach to the coming week, which improves the efficiency and efficacy of your work.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn small decisions into routines.</strong> Decision-making works like a muscle: As you use it over the course of the day, it gets too exhausted to function effectively. One of the best strategies successful people use to work around their decision fatigue is to eliminate smaller decisions by turning them into routines. Doing so frees up mental resources for more complex decisions. Steve Jobs famously wore a black turtleneck to work every day. Mark Zuckerberg still wears a hoodie. Both men have stated that these iconic images are the simple result of daily routines intended to cut down on decision fatigue. They were both aware of our finite daily ability to make good decisions, as is Barack Obama, who said, “You’ll see I wear only gray or blue suits. I’m trying to pare down decisions. I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing, because I have too many other decisions to make.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make big decisions in the morning.</strong> Another great way to beat decision fatigue is to save small decisions for after work (when decision fatigue is greatest) and tackle complex decisions in the morning, when your mind is fresh. When you’re facing a stream of important decisions, a great trick is to wake up early and work on your most complicated tasks before you get hit with a bunch of distracting minor decisions (phones ringing, emails coming in). A similar strategy is to do some of the smaller things the night before to get a head start on the next day. For instance, lay out your outfit at night, so you don’t even have to think about it when you wake up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay close attention to your emotions.</strong> There’s an old saying: “Don’t make permanent decisions based on temporary emotions.” Emotionally intelligent people recognize and understand their emotions (including their intensity and their impact on behavior) so that they are able to look at decisions as objectively and rationally as possible. Unfortunately, most people aren’t good at recognizing their emotions. Strong decision makers, however, know that a bad mood can make them lash out or stray from their moral compass just as easily as a good mood can make them overconfident and impulsive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluate your options objectively.</strong> When really wrapped up in a decision, emotionally intelligent people weigh their options against a pre-determined set of criteria because they know that this makes decision-making easier and more effective. Here are some helpful criteria to consider: How does this decision benefit me? How does it hurt me? How does this benefit? How does it hurt? Does the decision reflect my values? Would I regret making this decision? Would I regret not making this decision?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sleep on it.</strong> Sleeping on your decision ensures that you have clarity of thought when you approach it the next day. It also allows time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>for your emotions to run their course. When you act too quickly, you tend to react, but when you give more focus and time to your decision, you expose important facets of it that you didn’t see before.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t sleep on it for too long.</strong> Emotionally intelligent people know the importance of gathering as much information as they can, but at the same time, they make certain not to fall prey to analysis paralysis. Instead of waiting for the moons to align, emotionally intelligent people know that they need to have a timetable for making their decision. Once they set that date, they are motivated to do their homework and some soul searching to meet the deadline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use exercise to recharge.</strong> This isn’t the first time I’ve touted the benefits of exercise for emotional intelligence, and it won’t be the last. The stress of a major decision naturally produces cortisol, the chemical that triggers the fight-or-flight response. Cortisol clouds your ability to think clearly and rationally. When you find yourself stressing about a decision, try exercising. As little as 30 minutes is all it takes to get a good endorphin-fueled buzz and return to mental clarity. Exercise also helps you get past that fight-or-flight state by putting the cortisol to practical use. Researchers have shown that long-term exercise improves the overall functioning of the brain regions responsible for decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek outside counsel.</strong> When approaching a decision, we naturally tend to pick an alternative and then gather information to support that decision, instead of gathering information and then choosing a side (this is called confirmation bias). A great way to beat confirmation bias is to seek outside opinions and advice from people who bring different perspectives to your situation. Their perspectives help you weigh your options more objectively and spot your subjective or irrational tendencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reflect on previous decisions.</strong> Mark Twain described the complicated nature of decision-making as follows: “Good decisions come from experience, but experience comes from making bad decisions.” This isn’t to say that the only way to become a great decision maker is to make a ton of mistakes. It just means that it’s important to keep past decisions front of mind. Emotionally intelligent people are aware enough of their past decisions and use them to their benefit when something similar comes up.</p>

<h4 id="trusting-your-intuition" style="position:relative;"><a href="#trusting-your-intuition" aria-label="trusting your intuition permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>TRUSTING YOUR INTUITION</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Slow down enough to hear your inner voice.</strong> Before you can pay attention to your intuition, you first have to be able to hear it amid the cacophony of your busy life. You have to slow down and listen, which often requires solitude. Taking some time away from the everyday, even something as brief as going for a walk, is a great way to turn up the volume of your intuition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow your inner voice.</strong> One of the primary reasons that some people are more intuitive than others is that they actually listen to their gut feeling instead of dismissing or doubting it. That doesn’t mean that they ignore their analytical mind and their critical thinking skills. There’s a difference between using reason as a system of checks and balances and using it to talk yourself out of what your intuition knows to be true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice empathic accuracy.</strong> I’d probably lose you if I said that highly intuitive people read minds, so I’ll use the scientific term: empathic accuracy. It’s not magic; it’s an intuitive awareness of what other people are thinking and feeling, using cues such as body language and tone of voice. It’s an extremely powerful form of empathy that helps foster deep connections with other people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice mindfulness.</strong> “Mindfulness” sounds even more New-Agey than trusting your intuition, but it’s really just a fancy term for focusing on being in the moment. Mindfulness is a great technique for filtering out all of the distractions in your environment and your brain. When you do that, you can hear your intuition loud and clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nurture your creativity.</strong> Did you have a paint-by-number kit when you were a kid? Talk about turning art into a science all you have to do is put the right color in the right little space. You may end up with a pretty painting, but the only intuition involved is guessing what colors you’re supposed to use in those really tiny spaces. No paint-by-numbers kit in the world can make a skilled artist create something as novel and monumental as the Sistine Chapel or the Mona Lisa. The missing ingredient is intuition. Just as intuition is the secret ingredient in creativity, being intentionally creative strengthens your use of intuition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Listen to your body.</strong> Have you ever made a decision and immediately felt sick-maybe even kind of clammy? That affective experience is your body’s way of informing you that the decision your analytic mind came to is at odds with your instinct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analyze your dreams.</strong> If you accept the science that demonstrates the power of intuition, it’s not much of a leap to accept that your dreams are often manifestations of intuition. Sure, sometimes dreams are nonsense, but they often try to tell us something. Intuitive people don’t just think, “Wow, that was a weird dream!” They ask themselves, “Where did that come from, and what can I take away from it?”</p>

<h4 id="dealing-with-uncertainty" style="position:relative;"><a href="#dealing-with-uncertainty" aria-label="dealing with uncertainty permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTY</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Quiet your limbic system.</strong> Your limbic system responds to uncertainty with a knee-jerk fear reaction, and fear inhibits good decision- making. People who are good at dealing with uncertainty are wary of this fear and spot it as soon as it surfaces. This way, they can contain it before it gets out of control. Once they are aware of the fear, they label all the irrational thoughts that try to intensify it as irrational fears not reality-and the fear subsides. Then they can focus more accurately and rationally on the information they have. Throughout the process, they remind themselves that a primitive part of their brain is trying to take over and that the logical part needs to be the one in charge. In other words, they tell their limbic system to settle down and be quiet unless a hungry tiger shows up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t seek perfection.</strong> Emotionally intelligent people don’t set perfection as their target because they know there’s no such thing as a perfect decision in an uncertain situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Know what you know-and what you don’t.</strong> When uncertainty makes a decision difficult, it’s easy to feel as if everything is uncertain,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but that’s hardly ever the case. People who excel at managing uncertainty start by taking stock of what they know and what they don’t know and assigning a factor of importance to each. They gather all the facts they have, and they take their best shot at compiling a list of things they don’t know, for example, what a country’s currency is going to do or what strategy a competitor will employ. They actually try to identify as many of these things as possible, because this takes away their power. Then they can make the best decision possible with the facts they have.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace that which you can’t control.</strong> We all like to be in control. After all, people who feel like they’re at the mercy of their surroundings never get anywhere in life. But this desire for control can backfire when you see everything that you can’t control or don’t know as a personal failure. People who excel at managing uncertainty aren’t afraid to acknowledge what’s causing it. In other words, they live in the real world. They don’t paint any situation as better or worse than it actually is, and they analyze the facts for what they are. They know that the only thing they really control is the process through which they reach their decisions. That’s the only rational way to handle the unknown, and the best way to keep your head on level ground. Don’t be afraid to step up and say, “Here’s what we don’t know, but we’re going forward based on what we do know. We may make mistakes, but that’s a lot better than standing still.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on what matters.</strong> Some decisions can make or break you. Most just aren’t that important. The people who are the best at making decisions in the face of uncertainty don’t waste their time getting stuck on decisions where the biggest risk is looking foolish. When it comes down to it, almost every decision contains at least a small factor of uncertainty-it’s an inevitable part of life. Learning to properly balance the many decisions on your plate, however, allows you to focus your energy on the things that matter and to make more informed choices. It also removes the unnecessary pressure and distraction caused by a flurry of small worries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Know when to trust your gut.</strong> Our ancestors relied on their intuition-their gut instinct for survival. Since most of us don’t face life-or- death decisions every day, we have to learn how to use this instinct to our benefit. I explained the importance of trusting your intuition earlier in this chapter, but the importance of your intuition in making good decisions is magnified the more you’re facing uncertainty. People who successfully deal with uncertainty recognize and embrace the power of their gut instincts, and they rely on some tried-and- true strategies to do so successfully:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>They recognize their own filters.</strong></em> They’re able to identify when they’re overly influenced by their assumptions and emotions or by another person’s opinion, for example. Their ability to filter out the feelings that aren’t coming from their intuition helps them focus on what is.</li>
<li><em><strong>They give their intuition some space.</strong></em> Gut instincts can’t be forced. Our intuition works best when we’re not pressuring it to come up with a solution. Albert Einstein said he got his best ideas while sailing, and when Steve Jobs was faced with a tough problem, he’d head out for a walk.</li>
<li><em><strong>They build a track record.</strong></em> People who deal well with uncertainty take the time to practice their intuition. They start by listening to their gut on small things and seeing how it goes so that they’ll know whether they can trust it when something big comes around. Have contingency plans. Staying on top of uncertainty is as much about planning for failure as it is about hoping for the best. Experts at handling uncertainty aren’t afraid to admit that they could be wrong, and that frees them up to make detailed, rational, and transparent contingency plans before taking action. Emotionally intelligent people know they aren’t always going to make the right decision. They know how to absorb and understand mistakes so that they can make better decisions in the future. And they never let mistakes get them down for too long.</li>

<li>It’s usually pretty obvious which bad habits are causing the most problems in your life-the ones that keep coming up in performance appraisals or sparking arguments with your spouse. Once you’ve identified a habit to change, the real challenge lies in understanding your triggers. That can be harder than it sounds, especially if the habit has become so ingrained that you do it subconsciously. If you give it enough thought, you’ll get to the bottom of it. Maybe you keep getting tickets for speeding, and you realize that you drive too fast when you leave work in a bad mood, or maybe you snack when you’re stressed. Looking inward to explore the source of the habit you’re trying to break makes breaking that habit possible. The first 10 days of trying to break the habit will provide substantial insight into its source, should you look.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Days 11-40: Spread the Word</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accountability is crucial for breaking bad habits. In this stage, you create a very vocal accountability network by telling everybody you can about the habit you’re trying to break. The more vocal you are about it, the more likely people are to call you out when you slip up. Let them know that you really want them to say something. Just remember that you might have to keep reminding them—it’s just as easy for them to forget and backslide as it is for you. Accountability feeds your efforts to avoid bad habits. Sure, you avoid them some on your own, but your efforts are turbocharged when you don’t want the negative attention that comes with engaging in your bad habits. Before long, you’ve had enough practice avoiding them, and sometimes you don’t even have to think about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Days 41-66: Mind Your Relapse Triggers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As you head for the home stretch, be ready to make some mistakes-it happens to everybody. Just be on the lookout for common threads running through those mistakes. If you tend to relapse in a certain situation, you’d be smart to avoid that trigger completely until you feel that your bad habit is really extinguished. In addition, keep an eye out for new or rare triggers that haven’t popped up yet. Keeping new triggers from surprising you when it feels like you’ve kicked a habit is typically the difference between success and failure this late in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Day 67: Reward Yourself</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, you could say that breaking the habit is its own reward, but why pass up an opportunity to celebrate? Just don’t celebrate by indulging in the habit that you worked so hard to break! Rewarding yourself is critical because it reinforces the new habit loop you’ve created to replace and extinguish the bad habit. You’ve replaced your old negative responses to your triggers with positive new ones. Without a clear and apparent reward, your mind might lose the urge to follow through in the future. You should also use this opportunity to reflect on and select the next habit you’re going to break.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The self-control required to develop good habits (and stop bad ones) also serves as the foundation for a strong work ethic and high productivity. Some bad habits cause more trouble than others. The following bad habits are the worst offenders. Shedding them will increase your productivity and allow you to enjoy the positive mood that comes with increased self-control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impulsively surfing the Internet.</strong> It takes you 15 consecutive minutes of focus before you can fully engage in a task. Once you do, you fall into a euphoric state of increased productivity called flow. Research has shown that people in a flow state are five times more productive than they would otherwise be. When you click out of your work because you get an itch to check the news, Facebook, a sport’s score, or what have you, this pulls you out of flow. This means you have to go through another 15 minutes of continuous focus to reenter the flow state. Click in and out of your work enough times, and you can go through an entire day without experiencing high productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eating too much sugar.</strong> Glucose functions as the “gas pedal” for energy in the brain. You need glucose to concentrate on challenging tasks. With too little glucose, you feel tired, unfocused, and slow; too much glucose leaves you jittery and unable to concentrate. The tricky thing is that you can get your glucose any way you want, and you’ll feel the same at least initially. The difference lies in how long your productivity lasts. Donuts, soda, and other forms of refined sugar lead to an energy boost that lasts only 20 minutes, while oatmeal, brown rice, and other foods containing complex carbohydrates release their energy slowly, enabling you to sustain your focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using multiple notifications.</strong> Multiple notifications are a productivity nightmare. Studies have shown that hopping on your phone and email every time they ping causes your productivity to plummet. Getting notified every time a message drops onto your phone or an email arrives in your inbox might feel productive, but it isn’t. Instead of working at the whim of your notifications, pool all your emails/ texts and check them at designated times (e.g., respond to your emails every hour). This is a proven, productive way to work. In addition to checking email on a schedule, productive people take advantage of features that prioritize messages by sender. They set alerts for their most important vendors and their best customers, and they save the rest until they reach a stopping point in their work. Some people even set up an autoresponder that lets senders know when they’ll be checking their email again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Putting off tough tasks.</strong> We have a limited amount of mental energy, and as we exhaust this energy, our decision-making and productivity decline rapidly. This is called decision fatigue. When you put off tough tasks until late in the day because they’re intimidating, you save them for when you’re at your worst. To beat decision fatigue, you should tackle complex tasks in the morning when your mind is fresh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Letting toxic people live in your head rent free.</strong> There will always be toxic people who have a way of getting under your skin and staying there. Each time you find yourself thinking about a coworker or person who makes your blood boil, practice being grateful for someone else in your life instead. There are plenty of people out there who deserve your attention, and the last thing you want to do is think about the people who don’t matter when there are people who do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hitting the snooze button.</strong> When you sleep, your brain moves through an elaborate series of cycles, the last of which prepares you to be alert at your wake-up time. This is why you sometimes wake up right before your alarm clock goes off your brain knows it’s time to wake up, and it’s ready to do so. When you hit the snooze button and fall back asleep, you lose this alertness and wake up later, tired and groggy. Worst of all, this grogginess can take hours to wear off. So, no matter how tired you think you are when your alarm clock goes off, force yourself out of bed if you want to have a productive morning.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The researchers showed that people who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information, or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They found that heavy multitaskers-those who multitask a lot and feel that it boosts their performance were actually worse at multitasking than those who like to do a single thing at a time. The frequent multitaskers performed worse because they had more trouble organizing their thoughts and filtering out irrelevant information, and they were slower at switching from one task to another. Ouch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multitasking reduces your efficiency and performance because your brain can focus on only one thing at a time. When you try to do two things at once, your brain lacks the capacity to perform both tasks successfully. Researchers have also shown that in addition to slowing you down, multitasking temporarily lowers your IQ. A study at the University of London found that participants who multitasked during cognitive tasks experienced IQ score declines that were similar to what they’d expect if they had stayed up all night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re prone to multitasking, this is a bad habit you’ll want to break-it clearly slows you down and decreases the quality of your work. Even if it doesn’t cause brain damage, allowing yourself to multitask will fuel any existing difficulties you have with concentration, organization, and attention to detail. Multitasking in meetings and other social settings indicates low self- and social awareness, two emotional intelligence skills that are critical to success at work. If multitasking does damage your anterior cingulate cortex (a key brain region for EQ), as current research suggests, it will lower your EQ in the process. So, every time you multitask, you aren’t just harming your performance in the moment; you may very well be damaging an area of your brain that’s critical to your future success at work.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You should be very careful in choosing your pursuits, because your habits make you. Cultivating the right habits will take you where you want to go in life. The emotional intelligence habits that follow are a great start. They will help you lead a more meaningful and fulfilling life in which you cultivate the best within yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be biased toward action.</strong> If only we knew about all the great ideas that never came to fruition because people lacked the confidence to put them into action. Emotionally intelligent people confidently act on their ideas because they know that a failed idea is not a reflection of their ability; instead, they see it as a wonderful learning opportunity. This makes them eager to get going.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek composure.</strong> People who are composed constantly monitor their emotions. They understand their emotions well, and they use this knowledge in the moment to react with self-control to challenging situations. When things go downhill, they are persistently calm and frustratingly content (frustrating to those who aren’t, at least). They know that no matter how good or bad things get, everything changes with time. All they can do is adapt and adjust to stay happy and in control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Appreciate the here and now.</strong> Gratitude is fundamental to peace and happiness—not wealth, glamour, adventure, or fast cars, but simple appreciation for what you have. Just because you can’t afford champagne and caviar doesn’t mean that you never enjoy a meal. Hot dogs and beer on the back deck with your friends can taste just as good. So don’t fool yourself into thinking that to be happy you need</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>something that you don’t have. The truth is that if you don’t appreciate what you have now, you won’t be able to appreciate the “good life” if you ever get it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Realize that things aren’t always as you perceive them to be.</strong> This goes along with appreciating the here and now. That person you envy because they seem to have the perfect life might be dealing with all kinds of problems behind closed doors. That “perfection” could be a total mirage. Your employer’s decision to move the office might seem like a huge hassle when you first hear about it, but it could end up being one of the best things that ever happens to you. You’re not omniscient and you’re not a fortune-teller, so be open to the possibility that life might have some surprises in store, because what you see is not always what you get.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stick to realistic goals.</strong> How many people start January by proclaiming, “I’m going to lose 30 pounds by March!“? Big, scary, crazy goals can be incredibly inspiring until you fall short, and then, instead of inspiration, you’re left with disappointment and guilt. Don’t stop setting goals that push and challenge you, but try to stick within the bounds of reality. Small habits make big gains with time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expose yourself to a variety of people.</strong> There’s no easier way to learn to think differently than spending time with someone whose strengths are your weaknesses or whose ideas are radically different from your own. This exposure sparks new ideas and makes you well rounded. This is why we see so many great companies with cofounders who are very different. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at Apple were prime examples. Neither could have succeeded without the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn tedious tasks into games.</strong> Every job entails some degree of tedium. For most people, tedium leads to sloppy, rushed work. Emotionally intelligent people find ways to make the tedious interesting. By turning tedious work into a game, they challenge themselves and produce high-quality work, making things interesting in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start a collection of things that truly resonate with you.</strong> Have you ever come across a quote or a meme that so perfectly summed up your feelings that you wanted to keep it forever? When you come across things that resonate with you (whether it’s something that expresses who you are or who you want to be), have a central place to keep those gems. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a spiral notebook, a bulletin board, or a folder on Evernote. Have a place to collect the things that matter so that you can revisit them regularly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get out and do something that reminds you who you are.</strong> We all joke about having “me” time, but what is that, really? It’s making time for the activities that we feel most authentically ourselves doing. These are the times when all the masks are off, and we can just be. Whether it’s going for a run or dancing around with your ’80s favorites blaring at top volume, make time for those moments. They’re incredibly rejuvenating.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>They’re convergent and divergent thinkers.</strong> Convergent thinking is what’s measured by IQ tests: rational thinking that typically results in a single right answer. Divergent thinking, on the other hand, is less precise. It’s about generating ideas and asking questions that have no solid right or wrong answers. Both are important. No matter how high your IQ, you’re not going to be successful if you can’t think outside the proverbial box. On the other hand, you need rational thinking skills to correctly judge whether your ideas have merit. That’s why this particular paradox is so important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They’re polite yet completely unafraid to rock the boat.</strong> Successful people are what I like to call “graciously disruptive.” They’re never satisfied with the status quo. They’re the ones who constantly ask, “What if?” and “Why not?” They’re not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom, but they don’t disrupt things for the sake of being disruptive. They do it to make things better. Still, they’re polite and considerate, and they don’t draw attention to other people’s mistakes just to humiliate them. However, that doesn’t mean they sit back and let people wander in the wrong direction. They won’t hesitate to speak up when it’s time to change course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They’re naïve and smart.</strong> No one would argue that intelligence isn’t an important part of success, but many successful people also have a childlike lack of awareness (or maybe it’s a lack of respect for) of the type of constraints that other people blindly accept. They’re not limited by what other people tell them is possible. This naiveté allows them to tackle problems from previously undiscovered angles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They’re both energetic and calm.</strong> Successful people seem to have limitless energy when it comes to doing the things they’re passionate about, but they aren’t frantic. They can keep that energy under control. They work hard and focus on the task at hand with devoted concentration, but they’re so smooth that they make it look easy and fun. Some people are so energetic that they’re hyperactive, unfocused, and constantly bouncing from one thing to another. Successful people know how to harness their energy so that it works in the service of progress and doesn’t undermine it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They’re deeply passionate yet rational and objective about their work.</strong> Successful people are passionate about their work, but they don’t let it skew their thinking. They have the ability to step back and look at their work with a critical eye and accept their mistakes. If it’s a disaster, they’ll admit it because they realize that it’s better to try something different than to put out something subpar with their name on it. This sense of detachment also allows them to accept feedback from others without taking it personally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They’re ambiverts.</strong> Successful people are comfortable acting in ways that amplify their introversion and extraversion, depending on what the situation calls for. They can sit in the back of a conference room and silently listen to what’s going on, or they can go up on stage, grab a microphone, and engage a huge crowd-and they look just as comfortable doing one as they do the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They’re both humble and proud.</strong> Taking pride in your work is absolutely essential for success, but successful people know they wouldn’t be where they are without the people who came before them and those they’ve worked with along the way. They know that they didn’t achieve their success all on their own, and because they’re okay with that, they don’t have anything to prove. That’s why so many incredibly successful people end up coming across as grounded and humble when you meet them in person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They dream big but remain grounded.</strong> Successful people reach for the seemingly impossible, but they do so in a way that is actionable and realistic. While you may not know exactly how you’re going to achieve your dream, you need to make progress, no matter how small the steps. For example, Elon Musk’s goal at SpaceX is to “Occupy Mars.” This is a big dream, but Musk keeps it realistic by engaging in regular steps that, someday, may get them there. SpaceX’s ability to reuse rocket boosters is radically reducing the cost of space travel. It’s a far cry from colonizing Mars, but it’s an essential step in a very ambitious process.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Wake Up Early</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not all creative minds are morning people. Franz Kafka routinely stayed up all night writing, and William Styron (author of Sophie’s Choice, among other best-sellers) woke up at noon every day and considered his “morning” routine to be staying in bed for another hour to think. However, early risers make up the clear majority of creative thinkers. The list of creative early risers ranges from Benjamin Franklin to Howard Schultz to Ernest Hemingway, although they didn’t wake up early for the same reasons. Ben Franklin woke up early to plan his day, while Schultz used the time to send motivational emails to his employees. For many creative people, waking up early is a way to avoid distractions. Ernest Hemingway woke up at 5 a.m. every day to write. He said, “There is no one to disturb you and it is cool and cold and you come to your work and warm as you write.” The trick to making getting up early stick is to do it every day and avoid naps. Eventually, you’ll start going to bed earlier to make up for the lost sleep. This can make for a couple of groggy days at first, but you’ll adjust quickly. Before you know it, you’ll join the ranks of creative early risers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep Your Day Job</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creativity flourishes when you’re creating for yourself and no one else. Creativity becomes more difficult when your livelihood depends on what you create (and when you begin to think too much about what your audience will think of your product). Perhaps this is why so many successful and creative people held on to their day jobs. Many of them, like Stephen King, who was a schoolteacher, produced their breakout (and, in King’s case, what many consider his very best) work while they still held a 9 to 5. Day jobs provide more than the much-needed financial security to create freely. They also add structure to your day that can make your creative time a wonderful release. The list of successful, creative minds who kept their day jobs is long. Some notable individuals include Jacob Arabo, who started designing his own jewelry while working in a jewelry shop; William Faulkner, who worked in a power plant while writing As I Lay Dying; and composer Philip Glass, who worked as a plumber.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise Frequently</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There’s plenty of evidence pointing to the benefits of exercise for creativity. Feeling good physically gets you in the right mood to focus and be productive. Exercise also forces you to have disconnected time (it’s tough to text or email while working out hard), and this allows you to reflect on whatever it is you’re working on. In a Stanford study, 90% of people were more creative after exercising. It’s no surprise that so many creative and successful people build exercise into their daily routines. Kurt Vonnegut took walks into the nearby town, swam laps, and did push-ups and sit-ups, Richard Branson runs every morning, and composers Beethoven and Tchaikovsky walked every day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stick to a Strict Schedule</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a common misconception that in order to be creative, you should live life on a whim with no structure and no sense of needing to do anything. The habits of highly successful and creative people suggest otherwise. In fact, most creative minds scheduled their days rigorously. Psychologist William James described the impact of a schedule on creativity, saying that only by having a schedule can we “free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn to Work Anywhere, Anytime</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many people work in only one place, believing it’s practically impossible for them to get anything done anywhere else. Staying in one place is actually a crutch; studies show that changing environments is beneficial to productivity and creativity. E.B. White, author of Charlotte’s Web, said it well: “A writer who waits for ideal conditions under which to work will die without putting a word on paper.” The same is true for any type of creative work. If you keep waiting until you’re in the perfect place at the ideal time, the time will never come. Steve Jobs started Apple in his mom’s garage, and J.K. Rowling wrote the first ideas for Harry Potter on a napkin on a train. When you have a creative idea, don’t wait. Put it into action as soon as you can. Recording that spark of creativity may very well be the foundation of something great.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn that Creative Blocks Are Just Procrastination</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your heart is still beating, you have the ability to come up with new ideas and execute them. They may not always be great ones, but the greatest enemy of creativity is inactivity. Author Jodi Picoult summarized creative blocks perfectly: “I don’t believe in writer’s block. Think about it—when you were blocked in college and had to write a paper, didn’t it always manage to fix itself the night before the paper was due? Writer’s block is having too much time on your hands. If you have a limited amount of time to write, you just sit down and do it. You might not write well every day, but you can always edit a bad page. You can’t edit a blank page.” Picoult’s comment describes all creative activity-the only way to stay creative is to keep moving forward.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Thankfully, Dr. Brink’s research points to objective, well-documented physiological and behavioral changes or “tells”— that we can use to accurately assess other people’s truthfulness. Keep an eye out for the following signs, and you can use your emotional intelligence to ensure you won’t be taken advantage of by a liar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They repeat themselves and provide too much detail.</strong> Liars hate silence, so they often try to fill it up by talking more than they need to. They provide far more information than needed or asked for. Sometimes, the longer you stay quiet, the more details liars throw in to support their story as they try to convince you and themselves of their deception. Liars also repeat phrases over and over again as they struggle to buy time to gather their thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They cover their mouths.</strong> People often cover their mouths when lying. A hand on the mouth or even a touch of the lips shows you that they may be lying, because this unconscious body language represents a closing off of communication. When lying, people also instinctively cover vulnerable body parts, such as the head, neck, or abdomen, because lying makes them feel exposed, vulnerable, and open to attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They prepare for an escape.</strong> In an unconscious attempt to find an escape route, people who are lying often angle their bodies toward the door if they’re sitting, and they may even move closer to the door if they’re standing. They may also change their posture from relaxed to erect or guarded as their bodies perk up in unconscious preparation for an escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They fidget.</strong> Fidgeting is a clear sign of nervous energy. Even practiced liars worry that you won’t believe them, so they release that nervous energy by playing with their hair, tapping their feet or fingers, pulling on their ears, and more. Shuffling the feet is a common expression of nervous energy associated with lying. Their feet start moving because the liar feels vulnerable, and their body wants to flee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Their breathing changes.</strong> People reflexively start breathing more heavily when they lie, as lying causes changes in their heart rate and blood flow. Sometimes, liars even have trouble speaking, as the mucous membranes in their mouth dry out as part of their body’s response to lying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Their words and body language don’t match.</strong> It’s easy to lie with words, but our bodies know (and show) the truth. A clear sign that someone is lying to you is when their words are saying one thing, and their body language is saying something entirely different. For example, someone is telling you a sad story about the personal struggles that made them miss work, yet they’re smiling while they’re talking, and their hand gestures and body posture are animated and excited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They change their typical eye movement patterns.</strong> They say that the eyes are the “windows to the soul.” That’s especially true when someone is lying. But there’s a catch: It’s not where the person is looking that matters, but the change in direction. Some people, for instance, look up and to the right when they’re remembering information, but down when they’re lying. For other people, it’s the opposite. A change in eye movement can be a very strong indicator of lying, but you have to know the person’s typical pattern first. That makes this tactic more suitable to use with people you know well, or at least interact with regularly. However, one eye movement “tell” is pretty universal: People who are lying often look toward the door, their unconscious escape route.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They get aggressive.</strong> Liars often get aggressive in a conversation for no apparent reason. Sometimes, they become hostile and point aggressively in your direction. Other times, liars maintain excessive eye contact without blinking, in an abrasive attempt to appear truthful. If someone’s aggression is making you uncomfortable, and they seem to be lying, they probably are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before rushing to conclusions about someone you think might be lying, be certain to consider what constitutes normal behavior for them. The indicators I’ve mentioned have meaning only in the context of a person’s typical behavior. If your friend has ADHD and fidgets constantly, you can’t take their fidgeting as a sign of lying. Some people, such as psychopaths, don’t demonstrate these behaviors because they don’t feel nervous or guilty about lying. A British study showed that the incidence of psychopathy among CEOs is four times that of the general population, so it’s not as unlikely as you might think.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>First, make certain you understand the rules.</strong> Before you decide what course of action to take, consider the recent history of similar situations. If you’re going to call someone out, you need to know what you’re getting yourself and the liar into. Know the severity of the consequences for lying (if in a setting such as the workplace), and make certain you follow the proper protocol for addressing it, or calling the liar out could backfire on you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Option 1: Do nothing.</strong> Nobody likes being lied to, and the natural reaction is to call the liar out, but that’s not always the smartest thing to do. Before you do anything, ask yourself, “What’s at stake besides my ego?” Carefully weigh the pros and cons before you act. Consider who, if anyone, should know about the lie and the implications for them. Sometimes, the animosity you avoid by staying silent is worth more than the satisfaction you receive from speaking out. This is especially true with smaller lies. At other times, the lie is serious enough that people have to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Option 2: Deflect with humor.</strong> Some lies are too big to ignore completely but too small to make a big deal out of. When this happens, you can always make a joke about it. Playful comments that acknowledge the lie usually do the trick: “Hey, I think I just saw your nose grow a little bit” or “I need to get my prescription checked. When I looked at the scorecard, it said you shot 112.” This strategy gives the liar a chance to admit their slip-up without fear of reprisal. The key to making this tactic work is to give the impression that the other person was kidding around or intentionally exaggerating and never expected to be believed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Option 3: Play dumb.</strong> Another way to let someone save face and this is particularly appropriate for group settings-is to play dumb. Pretend you suddenly suffered a memory lapse or are confused about the facts. Ask lots of follow-up questions. The more details you request, the more likely the truth will come out. Drawing it out gives the liar a chance to admit that they “misspoke” and correct themselves without being called a liar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Option 4: Call them on it.</strong> In situations where doing nothing isn’t a good option, you can always call the liar out. You just need to think carefully about the best way to do this. Impulsively bashing them is never a smart move. You may choose to have a private conversation with the liar or with others affected by the lie. In either case, it’s important to have evidence that backs up your claim, or you may be called a liar. Make certain you are honest and direct with the person who lied. Don’t go to others with the lie when you know it’s better handled privately between you and the liar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many times, calling out a lie is the right thing to do, both ethically and practically. Sometimes, not reporting a lie can cost you your job. However, you need to think about a few things before you take that step. First, question your motives. Are you thinking about telling someone about the lie out of concern that they or someone else could be harmed, or are you just mad? If it’s the latter, you run the risk of making yourself look petty. If it’s the former, stick to the facts. Don’t offer any hypotheses about why the person may be lying, because that’s just supposition on your part. Stick to what the person said, what the truth is, and any proof you’ve collected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not optional: Protect yourself.</strong> Whether you decide to call out a lie or to let it go, once you know you’re dealing with a liar, take steps to protect yourself, especially at work. One way to do this is to have a witness attest to what the liar said. Failing this, interact with the liar via email or text, both of which create a written record. However, if you’re dealing with a particularly savvy liar, they’re not going to commit to anything in writing. In that case, document the conversation yourself: who, what, when, where, etc. Cap it off by sending your lying colleague an email summarizing the conversation. That’s not as good as having proof in the other person’s words, but at least you’ll be able to make the argument that your colleague had the opportunity to correct you.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>emotional manipulators are easy enough to spot if you know what to look for.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>They undermine your faith in your grasp of reality.</strong> Emotional manipulators are incredibly skilled liars and gaslighters. They insist that an incident didn’t happen when it did, and they insist they did or said something when they didn’t. The trouble is, they’re so good at it that you end up questioning your own sanity. Insisting that whatever caused the problem is a figment of your imagination is an extremely powerful way of getting out of a jam. Their utter confidence in the lie makes you question your own perception of events. They are an emotional black hole. Whatever emotional manipulators are feeling, they’re geniuses at sucking everyone around them into those emotions. If they’re in a bad mood, everyone around them knows it. But that’s not the worst part: They’re so skillful that not only is everyone aware of their mood, but they also feel it. This creates a tendency for people to feel responsible for the manipulator’s moods and obligated to fix them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They are experts at doling out guilt.</strong> Emotional manipulators are masters at leveraging your guilt to their advantage. If you bring up something that’s bothering you, they make you feel guilty for mentioning it. If you don’t mention it, they make you feel guilty for keeping it to yourself and stewing about it. When you’re dealing with emotional manipulators, whatever you do is wrong, and no matter what problems the two of you are having, they’re your fault.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They claim the role of the victim.</strong> When it comes to emotional manipulators, nothing is ever their fault. No matter what they do (or fail to do) it’s someone else’s fault. Someone else made them do it and usually, it’s you. If you get mad or upset, it’s your fault for having unreasonable expectations. If they get mad, it’s your fault for upsetting them. Emotional manipulators don’t take accountability for anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Their actions don’t match their words.</strong> Emotional manipulators tell you what you want to hear, but their actions are another story. They pledge their support, but when it’s time to follow through, they act as though your requests are completely unreasonable. They tell you how lucky they are to know you, and then act as though you’re a burden. This is just another way of undermining your belief in your own sanity. They make you question reality as you see it and mold your perception according to what is convenient to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They are too much, too soon.</strong> Whether it’s a personal relationship or a business relationship, emotional manipulators always seem to skip a few steps. They share too much too soon and expect the same from you. They appear vulnerable and sensitive, but it’s a ruse. The charade is intended to make you feel “special” for being let into their inner circle, but it’s also intended to make you feel not just sorry for them but also responsible for their feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They eagerly agree to help-and maybe even volunteer-and then act like martyrs</strong>. An initial eagerness to help swiftly morphs into sighs, groans, and suggestions that whatever they agreed to do is a huge burden. If you shine a spotlight on that reluctance, they’ll turn it around on you, assuring you that, of course, they want to help and that you’re just being paranoid. The goal? To make you feel guilty, indebted, and maybe even crazy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They always one-up you.</strong> No matter what problems you may have, emotional manipulators have it worse. They undermine the legitimacy of your complaints by reminding you that their problems are more serious. The message? You have no reason to complain, so shut the heck up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>They know all your buttons and don’t hesitate to push them.</strong> Emotional manipulators know your weak spots, and they’re quick to use that knowledge against you. If you’re insecure about your weight, they comment on what you eat or the way your clothes fit. If you’re worried about an upcoming presentation, they point out how intimidating and judgmental the attendees are. Their awareness of your emotions is off the charts, but they use it to manipulate you, not to make you feel better.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Gossip</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eleanor Roosevelt famously said, “Great minds discuss ideas, average ones discuss events, and small minds discuss people.” Gossipers derive pleasure from other people’s misfortunes. It might be fun at first to discuss somebody else’s personal or professional misfortune, but over time, it gets tiring, makes you feel gross, and hurts other people. There are too many positives out there and too much to learn from interesting people to waste your time talking about the misfortunes of others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Victim</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Victims are tough to identify because you initially empathize with their problems. However, as time passes, you begin to realize that their “time of need” is all the time. Victims actively push away any personal responsibility by making every speed bump they encounter into an uncrossable mountain. They don’t see tough times as opportunities to learn and grow from; instead, they see them as an out. There’s an old saying: “Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.” It perfectly captures the toxicity of the victim, who chooses to suffer every time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Arrogant</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arrogant people are a waste of your time because they see everything you do as a personal challenge. Arrogance is false confidence, and it always masks major insecurities. Arrogant people tend to be lower performers, be more disagreeable, and have more cognitive problems than the average person. Arrogant people can be completely self-absorbed, and they bring you down through the impassionate distance they maintain from other people. You can usually tell when you’re hanging around self-absorbed people because you start to feel completely alone. This happens because as far as they’re concerned, there’s no point in having a real connection with anyone else. You’re merely a tool used to build their self-esteem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Envious</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To envious people, the grass is always greener somewhere else. Even when something great happens to envious people, they don’t derive any satisfaction from it. That’s because they measure their fortune against the world’s when they should be deriving their satisfaction from within. And let’s face it, there’s always someone out there who’s doing better if you look hard enough. Spending too much time around envious people is dangerous because they teach you to trivialize your own accomplishments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Manipulator</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Manipulators suck time and energy out of your life under the façade of friendship. They can be tricky to deal with because they treat you like a friend. They know what you like, what makes you happy, and what you think is funny. However, they use this information as part of a hidden agenda. Manipulators always want something from you, and if you look back on your relationships with them, it’s all take, take, take, with little or no giving. They’ll do anything to win you over, just so they can work you over.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Dementor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In J. K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series, Dementors are evil creatures that suck people’s souls out of their bodies, leaving them shells of humans. Whenever a Dementor enters the room, it goes dark, people get cold, and they begin to recall their worst memories. Rowling said that she based them on highly negative people—the kind of people who have the ability to walk into a room and instantly suck the life out of it. Dementors suck the life out of the room by imposing their negativity and pessimism on everyone they encounter. Their viewpoints are always “the glass is half empty,” and they can inject fear and concern into even the most benign situations. A Notre Dame University study found that students assigned to roommates who thought negatively were far more likely to develop negative thinking and even depression themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Temperamental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some people have absolutely no control over their emotions. They lash out at you and project their feelings onto you, all the while thinking that you’re the one causing their malaise. Temperamental people are tough to dump from your life because their lack of control over their emotions makes you feel bad for them. When push comes to shove, though, temperamental people will use you as their emotional toilet and should be avoided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Twisted</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are certain toxic people who have bad intentions, deriving deep satisfaction from the pain and misery of others. They are out to hurt you, to make you feel bad, or to get something from you. Otherwise, they have no interest in you. The only good thing about this type is that you can spot their intentions quickly, which makes it that much faster to get them out of your life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Judgmental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Judgmental people are quick to tell you exactly what is and isn’t cool. They have a way of taking the thing you’re most passionate about and making you feel terrible about it. Instead of appreciating and learning from people who are different from them, judgmental people look down on others. Judgmental people stifle your desire to be passionate and expressive, so you’re best off cutting them out and being yourself.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Set limits (especially with complainers).</strong> Complainers and negative people are bad news because they swallow in their problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want others to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to complainers because they don’t want to be seen as callous or rude, but there’s a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into their negative emotional spiral. You can avoid this only by setting limits and distancing yourself when necessary. One way to set a limit is to ask complainers how they intend to fix the problem. They will either quiet down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t die in the fight.</strong> People with high EQ know how important it is to live to fight another day, especially when your foe is a toxic individual. In conflict, unchecked emotion makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle that can leave you severely damaged. When you read and respond to your emotions, you’re able to choose your battles wisely and stand your ground only when the time is right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay aware of your emotions.</strong> Maintaining emotional distance requires awareness. You can’t stop someone from pushing your buttons if you don’t recognize when it’s happening. Sometimes, you’ll find yourself in situations in which you’ll need to regroup and choose the best way forward. This is fine, and you shouldn’t be afraid to buy yourself some time to do so. Think of it this way-if a mentally unstable person approaches you on the street and tells you he’s John F. Kennedy, you’re unlikely to set him straight. When you find yourself with a coworker who is engaged in similarly derailed thinking, sometimes it’s best to just smile and nod. If you’re going to have to straighten them out, it’s better to give yourself some time to plan the best way to go about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rise above.</strong> Toxic people drive you crazy because their behavior is so irrational. Make no mistake about it; their behavior truly goes against reason. So, why do you allow yourself to respond to them emotionally and get sucked into the mix? The more irrational and off- base someone is, the easier it should be for you to remove yourself from their traps. Quit trying to beat them at their own game. You don’t need to respond to the emotional chaos-only the facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Establish boundaries.</strong> People feel like because they work or live with someone, they have no way to control the chaos. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Once you find someone’s behavior more predictable and easier to understand, you are equipped to think rationally about when and where you have to put up with them and when you don’t. For example, even if you work closely with someone on a project team, you don’t need to have the same level of one-on- one interaction with them you have with your other team members. You can establish a boundary, but you’ll have to do it consciously and proactively. If you let things happen naturally, you’re bound to find yourself constantly embroiled in difficult conversations. If you set boundaries and decide when and where you’ll engage a difficult person, you can control much of the chaos. The only trick is to stick to your guns and keep boundaries in place when the person tries to encroach upon them which they will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t focus on problems-only solutions.</strong> Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems you’re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and reduces stress. When it comes to toxic people, fixating on how crazy and difficult they are gives them power over you. Quit thinking about how troubling your difficult person is, and focus instead on how you’re going to handle them. This makes you more effective by putting you in control, and it will reduce the amount of stress you experience when interacting with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t forget.</strong> Emotionally intelligent people are quick to forgive, but that doesn’t mean that they forget. Forgiveness requires letting go of what’s happened so that you can move on. It doesn’t mean you’ll give a wrongdoer another chance. Emotionally intelligent people are unwilling to be bogged down unnecessarily by others’ mistakes, so they let them go quickly and are assertive in protecting themselves from future harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use your support system.</strong> It’s tempting but ineffective to try to tackle everything by yourself. To deal with toxic people, you need to recognize the weaknesses in your approach to them. This means tapping into your support system to gain perspective on a challenging person. Everyone has someone who is on their team, rooting for them, and ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify these individuals in your life and seek their insight and assistance when you need it. Something as simple as explaining the situation can lead to a new perspective. Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can’t because they are not as emotionally invested in the situation as you are.</p>

<ul>
<li>The secret to effectively handling conflict is assertiveness-that delicate place where you get your needs met without bullying the other person into submission. Assertive people operate in the small space that lies between passivity and aggression (that is, they never</li>
</ul>
<p>lean too far in either direction). It’s easy to think that nice people are too passive. Although that’s often true, unchecked passivity can boil over into aggression. So, there are plenty of very nice people out there who have exhibited both extremes of the assertiveness spectrum. To be assertive, you need to learn to engage in healthy conflict. Healthy conflict directly and constructively addresses the issue at hand without ignoring or trivializing the needs of either party. The following habits will help you handle conflict assertively.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider the repercussions of silence.</strong> Sometimes, it’s hard to muster the motivation to speak up when the likelihood is high that things will turn ugly. The fastest way to motivate yourself to act is to fully consider the costs of not speaking up-they’re typically far greater than standing up for yourself. The trick is that you need to shift your attention from the headache that will come with getting involved to the things you stand to gain from your assertiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask good questions until you get to the heart of the matter.</strong> Failing to understand the motive behind someone’s behavior throws fuel on the fire of conflict, because it makes everything they do appear foolish and shortsighted. Instead of pointing out flaws, you should seek to understand where the other person is coming from. Try asking good questions, such as, “Why did you choose to do it that way?” “What do you mean by that?” “Can you help me understand this better?” Even when you don’t see eye to eye, using questions to get at the underlying motive builds trust and understanding, both of which are conflict killers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When you challenge, offer solutions.</strong> People don’t like it when they feel as if you’re attempting to take apart their idea right off the bat. When you challenge someone’s idea but also offer a solution, you demonstrate that you want to work together to come up with a solution. This reinforces the value of their idea, even if it’s full of holes. For example, you might say, “One potential problem that I see with your idea is <em>However, I think we can overcome this problem if we can just figure out a way to</em>___.” In this example, you aren’t even providing the solution. You’re just acknowledging that you’re willing to work together to find one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Say “and” instead of “but.”</strong> The simple act of replacing the word “but” with “and” makes conflict much more constructive and collaborative. Say, for example, that your teammate John wants to use the majority of your budget on a marketing campaign, but you’re worried that won’t leave enough money for a critical new hire. Instead of saying, “I see that you want to use the money for marketing, but I think we need to make a new hire,” say, “I see that you want to use the money for marketing, and I think we need to make a new hire.” The difference is subtle, but the first sentence minimizes the value of his idea. The second sentence states the problem as you see it, without devaluing his idea, which then opens things up for discussion. Saying “and” makes the other party feel like you’re working with them, rather than against them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use hypotheticals.</strong> When you assert yourself, you don’t want it to look like you’re poking holes in their idea (even when you are). Hypotheticals are the perfect way to pull this off. Telling someone, for example, “Your new product idea won’t work because you overlooked how the sales team operates” comes across much more aggressively than suggesting the hypothetical, “How do you think our sales team will go about selling this new product?” When you see a flaw and present a hypothetical, you’re engaging with the original idea and giving the other party a chance to explain how it might work. This shows that you’re willing to hear the other person out.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Being Brutally Honest</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You’ve suffered in silence long enough. Your colleague continues to park so close to your car that you have to enter through the passenger door. You’ve asked them to stop. After half a dozen more violations, you decide to do something about it. Clearly, they need to know what you think of their intentional disrespect. So you let them have it. You go right up to them and tell them what an inconsiderate jerk they are.</li>
<li><strong>How to beat this? Honesty without brutality.</strong> From a young age, we’re taught that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend that the only options are brutality or harmony. With emotional intelligence, you can speak the truth without burning a bridge. Have you ever noticed how some conversations-even ones about very risky subjects go very well? And others, even those about trivial things, can degenerate into combat? The antidote to conflict is not diluting your message. It’s creating safety. Many people think the content of the conversation is what makes people defensive, so they assume it’s best to just go for it and be brutally honest. It isn’t. People don’t get defensive because of the content-they get defensive because of the intent they perceive behind it. It isn’t the truth that hurts—it’s the malice used to deliver the truth. When you remove your emotions from your message, you can be honest without being brutal. In this case telling your colleague that you’ve asked them before not to park so close to your car, that they continue to do so, that it’s a major inconvenience for you, and that you’d like them to stop is bound to get their attention and doesn’t require an ounce of malice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mistake 2: Robotically Sharing Your Feelings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some well-intentioned “communication” professionals suggest that when it’s time to speak up, the diplomatic way to do so is to start by sharing your feelings. For example, you tell your parking-impaired colleague, “I feel rage and disgust.” Somehow, that’s supposed to help. It doesn’t. People don’t work this way. Robotically sharing your feelings only alienates, annoys, and confuses them.</li>
<li><strong>How to beat this? Start with the facts.</strong> Our brains often serve us poorly during difficult conversations. To maximize cognitive efficiency, our minds store feelings and conclusions, but not the facts that created them. That’s why, when you give your colleague negative feedback and they ask for an example, you often hem and haw. You truly can’t remember. So you repeat your feelings or conclusions, but offer few helpful facts. Gathering the facts beforehand is the homework required to master conflict. Before opening your mouth, think through the basic information that helped you think or feel the way you do and prepare to share it first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mistake 3: Defending Your Position</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When someone takes an opposing view on a topic you care deeply about, the natural human response is “defense.” Our brains are hardwired to assess for threats, but when we let feelings of being threatened hijack our behavior, things never end well. In conflict, getting defensive is a surefire path to failure.</li>
<li><strong>How to beat this? Get curious.</strong> A great way to inoculate yourself against defensiveness is to develop a healthy doubt about your own certainty. Then, enter the conversation with intense curiosity about the other person’s world. Give yourself the detective’s task of discovering why a reasonable, rational, and decent person would think the way they do. As former Secretary of State Dean Rusk said, “The best way to persuade others is with your ears, by listening.” When others feel deeply understood, they become far more open to hearing you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mistake 4: Blaming Others for Your Situation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your boss tells you they’ll go to bat for you for a promotion. You hear later that in the HR review they advocated for your colleague instead. You feel betrayed and angry. Certainly, your boss is the one responsible for your pain-right? The truth is, they’re not the only one.</li>
<li><strong>How to beat this? Challenge your perspective.</strong> When we feel threatened, we amplify our negative emotions by blaming others for our problems. Remember the anger funnel? You won’t master conflict until you recognize the role you’ve played in creating your circumstances. Your boss may have passed you over, but they did so for a reason. Half your pain is the result of their betrayal; the other half is due to your disappointment over not performing well enough to win the promotion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mistake 5: Talking Yourself Out of Speaking Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s easy for conflict to fill you with dread. Under the influence of such stress, your negative self-talk takes over, and you obsess over all the bad things that might happen if you speak up. You conjure up images of conflict, retribution, isolation, and pain until you retreat into silence.</li>
<li><strong>How to beat this? Quantify the risks of not speaking up.</strong> The fastest way to motivate yourself to step up to difficult conversations is to simply articulate the costs of not speaking up. People who consistently speak up aren’t necessarily more courageous; they’re simply more accurate. First, they scrupulously review what’s likely to happen if they fail to speak up. Second, they ponder what might happen if they speak up and things go well. Finally (the order is important), they consider what may happen if the conversation goes poorly. Once they have an accurate understanding of the possibilities, saying something is their typical choice. The reward usually outweighs the risk.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Typing a message that comes across just like you do in person is a fine art. During a conversation, you adjust your tone, facial expression, gestures, and posture to fit the mood of what you’re conveying. You do this because people tend to be much more responsive to how you say things than to what you actually say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text strips a conversation bare. It’s efficient, but it turns otherwise easy interactions into messy misinterpretations. Without facial expressions and body posture to guide your message, people look at each word you type as an indicator of tone and mood. Most of the mistakes people make in their electronic messages are completely avoidable. The following bad habits lead to subtle mistakes and hidden blunders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Way-Too-Brief</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All too often, the cause of a virtual conflict is an imbalance between the effort in the initial message and the effort in the response to that message. When someone types up a detailed paragraph outlining important issues, they expect you to respond carefully. Sending back “Got it” or “Noted” just doesn’t do the trick. Without knowledge of your intent and tone, brief responses come across as apathetic and even sarcastic to the receiver. This is unfortunate because this is rarely the sender’s intent. The best way to avoid being misinterpreted in a brief response is to share your intent. Even responding with “I’m a little busy but should be able to read it later this week” comes across much better than “Got it,” which a lot of people will interpret as indifference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Compulsive CC and Reply All</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CCing people all the time is one of the most annoying things you can do when communicating electronically. I’d say it’s the most annoying, but this honor is bestowed on the excessive “Reply All.” If someone sends an email to you and a bunch of other people, do you really think every recipient needs to get another email from you saying “thanks”? They don’t, and when you do this, it sends people climbing up a wall. The trick for knowing when to CC someone is to treat your message as if it’s an in-person meeting. The question then becomes, “Would it be necessary or helpful to have this person come to the meeting?” If the answer is no, then don’t waste their time with a message. As for Reply All, just don’t do it. Even if someone else in the thread Replies All, you’re still annoying everyone to death when you join the fray. If you have something to say, it’s better to send it directly (and privately) to the original sender and let them decide if the group should know about it, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The “URGENT” Subject Line</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Subject lines that say “URGENT” or “ASAP” show complete disregard for the recipient. If your message is that urgent, pick up the phone and give the person a call. Even in the rare instance when a message is actually urgent, labeling it as such in the subject line is unnecessary and sets a strong, negative tone. The key to avoiding “URGENT” subject lines is twofold. First, if the issue is best dealt with in any form other than an electronic message, then that’s how you should be dealing with it. Second, if this is not the case, then the issue lies in your ability to create a strong subject line. After all, people check their messages frequently, so as long as your subject line catches their eye, it will get the job done. Instead of labeling the message urgent, ask yourself why the message is urgent. The answer to this question is your new subject line. If a client needs an answer today, then simply make your subject line “Client needs response today.” This maintains the sense of urgency without setting a rude, desperate tone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Debbie Downer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sending messages that consistently tell people what they’re doing wrong and what they shouldn’t be doing really takes a toll. Even if you’re trying to offer constructive criticism, you need to avoid negativity in your messages at all costs. Because people can’t hear your tone directly, they read into the connotations of words and create a tone in their heads as they go along. Negatives become especially negative in electronic form. Whenever you find yourself using negative words like “don’t,” “can’t,” “won’t,” or “couldn’t,” turn them into positives. Making this change transforms the entire tone of the message. For example, instead of saying, “You can’t complete reports like this in the future,” say, “Next time you complete a report, please…” When you must deliver negative feedback, don’t do it electronically. Just hop on the telephone or walk down the hall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Robot</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s easy to think of electronic communication as a way to get something done quickly, but when you do this to the extreme, you come across as inhuman. You wouldn’t walk into someone’s office and hand them a report to complete without acknowledging them somehow. Jumping straight into the nitty-gritty might seem like the most effective thing to do, but it leaves a lasting negative impression. Fixing this one is simple. Just take an extra second to greet the person you’re writing to. You don’t have to ask your recipient about their weekend. Just a simple acknowledgment of the individual as a human being is all it takes. This keeps the tone much more respectful than if you simply sent assignments.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Habit 1: Follow Honest Abe’s First Rule of Netiquette</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I know what you’re thinking: How could someone who died more than a century before the Internet existed teach us about message etiquette? Well, in Lincoln’s younger years, he had a bad habit of applying his legendary wit when writing insulting letters to, and about, his political rivals. But after one particularly scathing letter led a rival to challenge Lincoln to a duel, he learned a valuable lesson-words impact the receiver in ways that the sender can’t completely fathom.</li>
<li>By the time he died, Lincoln had amassed stacks of flaming letters that verbally shredded his rivals and subordinates for their bone- headed mistakes. However, Lincoln never sent them. He vented his frustration on paper and then stuffed the sheet away in a drawer. The following day, the full intensity of his emotions having subsided, Lincoln wrote and sent a much more congenial and conciliatory letter. We can all benefit from learning to do the same with electronic communication. Your emotions are a valid representation of how you feel (no matter how intense), but that doesn’t mean that acting on them in the moment serves you well. Go ahead and vent-tap out your anger and frustration on the keyboard. Save the draft and come back to it later when you’ve cooled down. By then, you’ll be rational enough to edit the message and pare down the parts that burn, or even better-rewrite the kind of message that you want to be remembered by.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Habit 2: Know the Limits of Virtual Humor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some people show their displeasure with words typed in ALL CAPS and a barrage of exclamation points. Others, however, express dissatisfaction more subtly with sarcasm and satire. The latter is no less of a breakdown in the core emotional intelligence skill of self- management, and it can be even more dangerous because it’s harder to detect when you’re doing it. The sender can always convince themselves that the spite was just a little joke.</li>
<li>Although a little good-natured ribbing can sometimes help lighten face-to-face interaction, it’s almost never a good idea to have a laugh at someone else’s expense when communicating electronically. In-person interactions equip you with an arsenal of facial expressions and voice inflections to help you convey the right tone. Digitally, you don’t have the same luxury. Your message can too easily be misinterpreted without your body language to help explain it, and you won’t be there to soften the blow when your joke doesn’t go over as intended. In the virtual world, it’s best to err on the side of friendliness and professionalism. For those times when you absolutely cannot resist using humor, just make sure you’re the butt of the joke.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Habit 3: Remember that People Virtually Are Still People</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While entranced by the warm glow of a phone or computer screen, it’s sometimes difficult to remember that a living, breathing human being will end up reading your message. Psychologist John Suler of Rider University found that when people are communicating virtually, they experience a “disinhibition effect.” Without the real-time feedback between sender and receiver that takes place in face- to-face and telecommunication, we simply don’t worry as much about offending people virtually. We don’t have to experience the discomfort of watching someone else become confused, despondent, or angry because of something that we said. When these natural consequences are delayed, we tend to spill onto the screen whatever happens to be on our minds.</li>
<li>To avert such messages, you have to apply your social awareness skills. When you cannot physically see the other person’s body language or hear the tone of their voice, picture the recipient in your mind and imagine what they might feel when reading your message as it’s been written. The next time you receive a curt or outright rude message, put the brakes on before firing back a retort. Taking the time to imagine the sender and consider where they’re coming from is often enough to extinguish the flames before they get out of control. Could the sender have misinterpreted a previous message that you sent to them? Could they just be having a bad day? Are they under a lot of pressure? Even when the other party is in the wrong, spending a moment on the other side of the screen will give you the perspective you need to avoid escalating the situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Habit 4: Let the Emojis Flow</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Emojis have a mixed reputation in the business world. Some people and even organizations believe that smiley faces, winks, and other caricatures of digital emotion are unprofessional and undignified, and have no place outside a school hallway. When used properly, however, emojis can effectively enhance the desired tone of a message, as shown by a Dutch research team. The team led by Daantje Derks at the Open University of the Netherlands concluded that “to a large extent, emojis serve the same functions as actual nonverbal behavior.” Considering that nonverbal behavior accounts for between 70% and 90% of a message when communicating face-to-face, it’s time to ditch the stigma attached to emojis in a business setting. For those leery of dropping a winky face into your next work message, I’m not suggesting that you smile, wink, and heart eyes your way through every message you write. Just don’t be afraid to use emojis when you want to be certain that the recipient understands the tone of your message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Habit 5: Recognize When Online Chats Need to Become Offline Discussions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Managing online relationships will always be a somewhat difficult task for people built to communicate in person. However, they become substantially more difficult anytime emotions run strong. Significant, lengthy, and heated exchanges are almost always better taken offline and finished in person, or at least on the phone or a video chat. With so much communication via messaging and email these days, it can be hard to pull the trigger and initiate a face-to-face conversation when you sense that an interaction is becoming too heated or simply too difficult to do well online. Online technologies have become enormously useful for increasing the speed and efficiency of communication, but they have a long way to go before they become the primary source for creating and maintaining quality human relationships.</li>

<li>Follow the <strong>3 What’s</strong> to keep conversations organized (see below)</li>
<li>Use <strong>stories, examples and analogies</strong> to make your points more memorable and relatable for the audience</li>
<li><strong>Standing up when presenting</strong> gives you a wider range of motion, you typically have more visual gestures (talking with your hand) and your audience can hear a difference in your voice (important even if you are in a voice only call)</li>

<p>“Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behavior and relationships”</p>
<p>“If I could sum up emotional in 2 words, it would  be ‘own it’”</p>
<p>replace “why is this happening to me” with “what is this trying to teach me?”, everything shifts.</p>
<p>“today I refuse to stress myself out about things I cannot control or change?”</p>
<p>“be crazy, be stupid, be silly, be weird, be whatever, because life is too short to be anything but happy.”</p>
<p>“Our own minds is what created fear and our own mind is the only thing that can smash through it”</p>
<p>Begin by asking yourself, “What emotion to I want to trigger in this situation?</p>
<p>Ask yourself: ‘Do I want to change this? Why do I want to change this?  What stands to happen if I don’t change this?’</p>
<p>Accepting that something is going to happen and that the only thing we can control is how we choose to respond is where EI comes in</p>
<p>“The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.”</p>
<p>“People who are truly successful use their emotional intelligence to focus on activities that address a variety of needs, not just immediate achievements.”</p>
<p>“Stop chasing the things that you think will make you happy and successful, and start realizing that you are the sum of your habits.”</p>

* **Community Life**: Community association actively runs events and collaborates with schools and police to support neighbourhood watch and safety programs ([Chris Strong Realtor][3]).

---

## 🏡 2. Housing Age & Styles

* Homes were primarily built in the late 1990s to early‑2000s, with some infill newer custom builds such as two‑storey executive homes (e.g., stucco & stone facades, large lots with shops) ([Drumheller Real Estate][4]).
* **Common types**: Mostly single‑detached homes (\~52% of dwellings in Anders South/Aspen Ridge), followed by apartments (\~12%), townhouses (\~0.4%) and duplex/semi‑detached (\~3.5%) ([City of Red Deer][5]).

---

## 📊 3. Zoning & Density

* Zoning is primarily R‑1 single‑family residential. Most lots are single‑family units; secondary suites may be allowed under city accessory suite policies. Multi‑unit redevelopment is limited unless lots are subdivided or rezoned — there’s no widespread allowance for duplex or triplex on standard lots without rezoning. (City zoning maps exist through the Red Deer GIS portal) ([City of Red Deer][6]).

---

## 👥 4. Population & Growth

* In 2019, population for the Anders South/Aspen Ridge zone was **3,867**, very stable compared to 2016/2015 (\~3,884/3,887). Zone growth in that period was essentially flat (slight decline) while the city overall grew \~1.2% from 2016 to 2019 ([City of Red Deer][5]).
* Expect modest growth since, consistent with infill rather than expansion.

---

## 💰 5. Income & Demographics

* Anders South median household income around **CAD 168,090**, which is \~7% higher cost‑of‑living but aligned with livability better than other Red Deer areas. Median age is about 24% higher than city average, indicating older/more established households ([Andrew Russell & Associates][2]).

---

## 🚨 6. Crime Rate & Safety

* Among the safest neighbourhoods in Red Deer. Crime rates are about **60% lower** than the city average. It’s widely noted for active neighbourhood watch, high civic engagement and very low violent and property crime ([Andrew Russell & Associates][2]).
* Contrast to general warnings about Red Deer overall from anecdotal reports — Anders South remains an outlier in safety ([Reddit][7]).

---

## 🏘️ 7. Rental Market (Supply / Demand, Rents)

* Rental supply is modest — primarily in secondary suites or boarder situations; formal multi‑unit product limited. Demand is steady from young professionals or families attracted to safety and schools.
* Average rents in Red Deer roughly A‑frame (two‑bedroom apartments) range CAD 1,200–1,400; for single‑family home lease around CAD 1,800–2,200 per month depending on size and finish.

---

## 🏅 8. Neighbourhood Grade

Based on income, safety, amenities, housing quality and demographics, Anders South qualifies as an **"A‑grade"** neighbourhood — one of the most desirable areas in Red Deer ([Drumheller Real Estate][4], [Andrew Russell & Associates][2]).

---

## 📈 9. Average Home Prices

* City-wide Red Deer average listing price (August 4, 2025) \~ **CAD 466,740** ([Shantel Campbell][8]).
* Anders South listings show upper‑mid range: e.g., \~\$638,800 to over \$1 million for larger executive homes; average in Anders Park \~ CAD 500,920 (similar character) ([Real Estate Homes][9]).

---

## 🔮 10. Appreciation vs Cash Flow

* Long‑term potential: modest home price growth in Red Deer market (around +7% YoY, slowing to <1% monthly) ([Big John][10]).
* High upfront investment in Anders South means capital appreciation strapped to city growth.
* Cash‑flow outlook is moderate: rental yields lower in single‑family in mature zone; however low vacancy and stable demand lend to consistent cash flow. Total returns hinge more on price appreciation than rental yield.

---

## 🧠 11. Investment Strategies That May Work

1. **Buy & Hold Single‑Family for Cash Flow**: Secondary suite or legal accessory suite improves yield.
2. **Renovation Flip**: Mid‑price home rehab for resale to premium‑income households.
3. **Infill/Re‑subdivision**: On large lots, apply for subdivision or duplex zoning if permitted.
4. **Niche Rental**: Lease high‑end executive family homes to professionals – premium rent segment.
5. **Long‑term Value Appreciation**: Hold in stable neighbourhood expecting steady price growth even if slower than major metro.

Zoning restricts multi-unit builds unless rezoned, so strategies focus on single-family asset plays, accessory suites, or high-end flips.

# **Clearview Ridge**

Here’s a detailed investment-oriented profile for **Clearview Ridge**, Red Deer, AB, based on the most current publicly available data:

---

## 📍 Overview & Amenities

* A modern planned neighbourhood in northeast Red Deer, anchored by **Clearview Market Square**, parks, multi-use pathways, wetlands, a small man‑made lake with spray park, playgrounds, rink, and proximity to Red Deer River Valley trails ([melcor.ca][1]).
* Nearby essentials: grocery and drugstore, restaurants, medical, fitness, transit. River Bend Golf Course and Discovery Canyon are nearby ([Genstar][2]).

---

## 🏘️ Housing Stock & Types

* Most housing built in **2010s–early 2020s**, built‑on‐greenfield by multiple builders including True Line, Prominent Homes, Abbey Master Builders, etc ([Genstar][2]).
* Common housing types: **single‑family detached homes** (starter to luxury), plus **townhouses/multi‑family** units in the Town Centre area ([Zillow][3]).

---

## ⚖️ Zoning & Lot Utilization

* Zoning allows primarily **R‑1 and R‑1A residential lots**, meaning one dwelling per lot. Small multi‑unit townhouse developments occur near the mixed‑use centre. There is **no general high‑density zoning** for multiple units per typical single‑family lot.

---

## 👥 Demographics, Income & Growth

* The City of Red Deer had \~100,844 residents in 2021, up modestly from \~100,418 in 2016 — growth less than 1% over five years, but more recent municipal estimates in 2019 reached \~101,002 ([Wikipedia][4]).
* Local demographic data specific to Clearview Ridge is limited, but it is characterized as a **family‑oriented** area with access to schools and daycares ([Local Logic][5]).
* Average household income: exact stats aren’t publicly available, but cost of living noted \~3% above city average, implying moderately higher median incomes relative to the Red Deer average ([Andrew Russell & Associates][6]).

---

## 🔒 Crime Profile

* Crime in Clearview Ridge is about **34% lower than the citywide average** ([AreaVibes][7]).
* Confirmed as one of the safer neighbourhoods by local perspectives ([Andrew Russell & Associates][6]).

---

## 🏘️ Rental Market & Pricing

* Rental supply/demand specifics for Clearview Ridge are scarce. But in Red Deer generally, **townhouses and single‑family homes** are in demand among families.
* Available townhouse listings: **C\$310 K–322 K** (approx. 2‑3 beds) ([Andrew Russell & Associates][6]). House listings range **C\$419 K–C\$854 K**, sizes 1,100–2,000 sq ft ([Zillow][8]).
* **Average house price** across listing sample is around **C\$578,000** ([Shantel Campbell][9]).
* Average rent levels in Red Deer vary; though specific rental speed in Clearview Ridge isn’t reported, comparable-built townhomes likely rent in the **C\$1,500–2,200/month** range, depending on layout and finish.

---

## 🏠 Neighborhood Quality (A/B/C/D)

* In investor grading terms, Clearview Ridge would likely be **A–/B+**: desirable, low-crime, newer builds, family-friendly amenities, but not ultra-high-end.

---

## 📈 Appreciation & Cash‑Flow Potential

* Homes are fairly new, so short‑term appreciation may be moderate. Carrying cost and modest price growth in Red Deer suggest **steady but not explosive** capital gains.
* Given relatively lower purchase prices (\~mid‑C\$500 K), strong rental yield potential exists if rentals rent well. Townhouse or small detached rental may achieve \~5–6% gross yield, depending on mortgage and expenses.
* Long-term, appreciation tied to Red Deer’s modest growth; infrastructure addition or densification near transit could lift value.

---

## 💡 Investment Strategies

1. **Buy a newer single‑family home** (\~C\$550 K–600 K), and rent to families—low capex, stable tenants.
2. **Acquire a townhouse** (\~C\$310 K–\~C\$350 K), especially close to market square, for higher yield and ease of turnover.
3. **Buy and hold**, expecting modest appreciation plus positive cash flow.
4. **Renovate and resell**: less scope because most homes are new, but cosmetic upgrades may support resale at top‑end prices.
5. **Group of investors**: develop small multi‑unit rental near commercial centre if allowed by zoning permissions.

---

## 📍 Amenities & Attractions

Timberlands offers numerous amenities: parks, playgrounds, walking trails, and natural landscapes. The neighbourhood provides **walkable access to shops, restaurants, a branch library**, transit routes, and schools. It's also well-connected to downtown Red Deer and Highway 11/67th Street ([reddeerland.ca][1]).

---

## 🏘️ Housing Stock & Common Types

Developed mostly in the **mid‑to‑late 2010s and early 2020s**, Timberlands features a **diverse mix**: detached single-family homes, semi‑detached, carriage‑style homes, and low-rise townhouses. Different lot sizes (standard, park‑side, wide/shallow) support this variety ([reddeerland.ca][1]).

---

## ⚖️ Zoning & Density

Zoning supports typical low‑density residential (single‑family, semi‑detached), with townhouse/row‑house allowed in specific sections. There’s **no allowance for high‑density multi‑unit on standard lots**, but townhouses or carriage homes are permitted on select parcels ([reddeerland.ca][1]).

---

## 👥 Population & Growth

While neighbourhood-level totals are scarce, the **2019 Red Deer municipal census** reported **\~823 new residents** added to Timberlands/Stone/Ridge/College Park combined, marking one of the fastest-growing zones in the city ([City of Red Deer][2]). The city population topped **101,000** in 2019 and has been growing gradually since ([Wikipedia][3]). Timberlands has about **35% greater density** than the rest of Red Deer and a **median age 16% lower** than the city average ([AreaVibes][4]).

---

## 💵 Income

Red Deer’s median family income is around **CAD 104,000**, above the Alberta average of **\~96,000** ([Alberta Regional Dashboard][5]). Timberlands—being newer and family‑oriented—is likely among the higher‑income brackets of the city, although no precise micro-level data is available.

---

## 🔒 Crime Rate

Timberlands registers a **crime rate \~34% below Red Deer average**, with violent crime also significantly lower. It earns a livability score of **≈69/100** ([AreaVibes][6]).

---

## 📈 Real Estate Prices & Types

* As of early August 2025, there are \~6 listings in Timberlands: **average maximum price \~CAD 799,900; average price \~699,083**; lowest around CAD 529,900 ([stevezacher.com][7]).
* Detached homes dominate; some semi‑detached also present.

---

## 📊 Rental Supply & Demand & Average Rents

* Newer detached and semi‑detached homes appeal to families, suggesting steady rental demand.

---

## 🧾 Neighborhood Grade

In investor grading terms, Timberlands ranks as a **B+** (family-friendly, modern, safe, above-average incomes and amenities).

---

## 📈 Appreciation vs. Cash Flow Potential

* Since development is recent (2015+), early price appreciation has largely occurred. Going forward, **moderate growth** is likely tied to Red Deer’s modest but stable population and economic expansion.
* Given typical purchase prices (\~CAD 700K) and expected rent, gross rental yields may range from **\~4–5%**, with potential closer to **5.5%** from smaller detached or semi units after financing and expenses.

---

## 💡 Investment Strategies

1. **Buy new/small detached or semi‑detached** (\~CAD 650K–750K), rent to families. Lower maintenance and high desirability.
2. **Acquire a semi‑detached or carriage‑style unit** near transit or amenities for better cash flow.
3. **Long‑term buy‑and‑hold** strategy: steady tenants, modest appreciation, minimal capex.
4. **Joint or builder partnership**: develop small carriage‑home clusters or townhomes (where allowed) to optimize density on select lots.

### ✅ Notes & Considerations

* **Zoning details** and future densification (e.g. infill allowances, secondary suite permissions) require consulting **City of Red Deer zoning bylaws or planning office**.
* **Detailed rental statistics**, incomes, and demographics at micro neighbourhood level would require municipal or Statistics Canada custom data.

## 🧾 Neighborhood Grade

Investment-wise, Westlake aligns as a **B+**: solid safety record, high-income households, good amenities, and strong community appeal — though not luxury-tier.

---

## 📈 Appreciation & Cash Flow Potential

* Appreciation potential is **moderate**: most development is post‑2000; major price inflation has already occurred. Future gains depend on incremental city growth, infrastructure, or infill zoning changes.
* Given purchase prices in the mid‑CAD 500–700K range and modest median rent (\~CAD 1,375/month for apartments), **gross rental yields are lower** (≈2.5–3% for apartments, potentially higher \~4–5% if renting detached homes post-renovation and aligning rents to size, amenities).
* Detached or duplex rental opportunities may yield better returns if purchased under market.

## 💡 Investment Strategies for Westlake

1. **Buy duplex units or convert legal duplex lots** (if permitted) to maximize occupancy and rental yield.
2. **Acquire mispriced single‑family homes**, renovate/upfit, then rent out — ideal for family rentals.
3. **Short-term hold with cosmetic upgrades**, then resell at premium once complete.
4. **Monitor zoning updates or infill rezoning plans**, which may allow higher density or secondary suites in future.
5. **Apartment or condo acquisition** (though supply is limited), renting at median rates or above.
